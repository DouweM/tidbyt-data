<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic researchers make new discoveries, develop first-of-its-kind tools and technologies and constantly improve upon existing ones with the goal to provide the best in healthcare. The following five stories are a round-up of some of the most significant medical research advances at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> over the past year. Discoveries range from harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to detect disease sooner to advancing treatments for rare and complex diseases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/10/11/advancing-ultrasound-microvessel-imaging-and-ai-to-improve-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advancing ultrasound microvessel imaging and AI to improve cancer detection</a></h2>



<p>Tumors consist not only of cancer cells but also a matrix of small blood vessels, or microvessels, that cannot be seen in the images produced by conventional ultrasound machines. To solve this problem, physician-scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/alizad-azra-m-d/bio-00085586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azra Alizad, M.D.</a>, and biomedical engineering scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fatemi-mostafa-ph-d/bio-00086282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostafa Fatemi, Ph.D.</a>, teamed up at Mayo Clinic to design and study a tool that may improve the resolution of ultrasound imaging. As demonstrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, they developed high-resolution ultrasound imaging software, compatible with many ultrasound machines, that could exponentially improve both the detail and quality of images. See the animation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCtLfFbWcEo&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>"If we can visualize and capture the microvessel in the earliest stages of cancer, we can better diagnose and treat it earlier, which improves the outcome for the patient," says Dr. Alizad, who specializes in ultrasound technology for cancer imaging.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/10/11/advancing-ultrasound-microvessel-imaging-and-ai-to-improve-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/19/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-ovarian-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harnessing the immune system to fight ovarian cancer</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic research is biomanufacturing an experimental, cell-based ovarian cancer vaccine and combining it with immunotherapy to study a "one-two punch" approach to halting disease progression in ovarian cancer patients. This research begins with a blood draw from women with advanced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>&nbsp;whose tumors have returned after standard surgery and chemotherapy. White blood cells are extracted from the blood, biomanufactured to become dendritic cells and are returned to the patient. Dendritic cells act as crusaders that march through the body, triggering the immune system to recognize and fight cancer.</p>



<p>"We're building on an earlier phase 1 clinical trial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18962-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that showed promising results</a>&nbsp;in terms of survival after the dendritic cell-based vaccine," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, co-principal investigator and medical oncologist. "Of the 18 evaluable patients in the phase 1 study, 11 had cancer return, but seven of them — 40%&nbsp;— have been cancer-free for almost 10 years. We typically expect 90% of patients in this condition to have the cancer return."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/19/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-ovarian-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/11/mayo-clinic-prepares-to-biomanufacture-a-new-car-t-cell-therapy-for-b-cell-blood-cancers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic prepares to biomanufacture a new CAR-T cell therapy for B-cell blood cancers</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic research has developed a new type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</a>&nbsp;aimed at killing B-cell blood cancers that have returned and are no longer responding to treatment. This pioneering technology, designed and developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, killed B-cell tumors grown in the laboratory and tumors implanted in mouse models. The preclinical findings are published in&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00262-023-03537-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy</a>.</p>



<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/11/mayo-clinic-prepares-to-biomanufacture-a-new-car-t-cell-therapy-for-b-cell-blood-cancers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Colonoscopy remains the gold standard in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer. But the procedure has limitations. Some studies suggest that&nbsp;more than half&nbsp;of post-colonoscopy colon cancer cases arise from lesions that were missed at patients’ previous colonoscopies.</p>



<p>"AI, particularly the subset of AI called computer vision, is naturally suited to what we do through the endoscope," says Michael B. Wallace, M.D., who describes himself as a bit of a technology geek.</p>



<p>In 2022, Dr. Wallace&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35304117/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published the results</a>&nbsp;of an international, multicenter study testing the impact of adding AI to routine colonoscopies. His team, which included James East, M.D., a gastroenterologist at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London</a>, as well as researchers from the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Germany and Ireland, found that incorporating AI into colonoscopies reduced the risk of missing polyps by 50%.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/02/03/artificial-intelligence-is-forging-a-new-future-for-gastroenterology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;researchers uncover evidence supporting a shorter treatment time for breast cancer patients in a randomized trial, published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(23)00388-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Oncology</a>. The study compared two separate dosing schedules of pencil-beam scanning proton therapy, the most advanced type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/proton-therapy/about/pac-20384758?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proton therapy</a>&nbsp;known for its precision in targeting cancer cells while preserving healthy tissue to reduce the risk of side effects.</p>



<p>"The study provides the first prospective data supporting the use of shorter-course proton PMRT, including in patients with immediate breast reconstruction, and the first mature results of a randomized trial in the field of breast particle therapy," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mutter-robert-w-m-d/bio-20343551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Mutter, M.D.</a>, a radiation oncologist and physician-scientist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "We can now consider the option of 15 days of therapy with patients based on the similar treatment outcomes observed as the longer conventional course. Of note, the short course actually resulted in reduced skin side effects during and after treatment."&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-mayo-clinic-study-reveals-proton-beam-therapy-may-shorten-breast-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic researchers mapped how the measles virus mutated and spread in the brain of a person who succumbed to a rare, lethal brain disease. New cases of this disease, which is a complication of the measles virus, may occur as measles reemerges among the unvaccinated, say researchers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="236" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Portrait_R_Cattaneo-236x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379378" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Portrait_R_Cattaneo-236x300.jpg 236w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Portrait_R_Cattaneo-806x1024.jpg 806w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Portrait_R_Cattaneo-768x976.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Portrait_R_Cattaneo.jpg 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Roberto Cattaneo, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Using the latest tools in genetic sequencing, researchers at Mayo Clinic reconstructed how a collective of viral genomes colonized a human brain. The virus acquired distinct mutations that drove the spread of the virus from the frontal cortex outward.</p>



<p>"Our study provides compelling data that shows how viral RNA mutated and spread throughout a human organ — the brain, in this case," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/cattaneo-roberto-ph-d/bio-00027692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Cattaneo, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic virologist who is a co-lead author on a new <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1011817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PLOS Pathogens study</a>. "Our discoveries will help studying and understanding how other viruses persist and adapt to the human brain, causing disease. This knowledge may facilitate the generation of effective antiviral drugs."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is measles?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Measles</a> is one of the most contagious diseases. The measles virus infects the upper respiratory tract where it uses the trachea, or windpipe, as a trampoline to launch and spread through droplets dispersed when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</p>



<p>Dr. Cattaneo pioneered <a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2019/08/28/insight-into-how-measles-might-reach-the-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> on how the measles virus spreads throughout the body.</p>



<p>He first began to study the measles virus about 40 years ago and was fascinated by the rare, lethal brain disease called <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/subacute-sclerosing-panencephalitis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)</a>, which occurs in about 1 in every 10,000 measles cases. It can take about five to 10 years after the initial infection for the measles virus to mutate and spread throughout the brain. Symptoms of this progressive neurological disease include memory loss, seizures and immobility. Dr. Cattaneo studied SSPE for several years until the lethal disease nearly disappeared as more people were vaccinated against measles.</p>

<p>However, measles is resurging due to vaccine hesitancy and missed vaccinations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of children missed receiving their measles vaccinations, which has resulted in an estimated 18% increase in measles cases and 43% increase in death from measles in 2021 compared to 2022 worldwide, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7246a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.</p>



<p>"We suspect SSPE cases will rise again as well. This is sad because this horrible disease can be prevented by vaccination. But now we are in the position to study SSPE with modern, genetic sequencing technology and learn more about it," says Iris Yousaf, co-lead author of the study and a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Cattaneo and Yousaf had a unique research opportunity through a collaboration with the CDC. They studied the brain of a person who had contracted measles as a child and had succumbed to SSPE years later as an adult. They investigated 15 specimens from different regions of the brain and conducted genetic sequencing on each region to piece together the puzzle of how the measles virus mutated and spread.</p>



<p>The researchers discovered that, after the measles virus entered the brain, its genome — the complete set of genetic material for the virus — began to change in harmful ways. The genome replicated, creating other genomes that were slightly different. Then, these genomes replicated again — resulting in more genomes that were each a little different as well. The virus did this multiple times, creating a population of varied genomes.</p>



<p>"In this population, two specific genomes had a combination of characteristics that worked together to promote virus spread from the initial location of the infection — the frontal cortex of the brain — out to colonize the entire organ," says Dr. Cattaneo.</p>



<p>The next steps in this research are to understand how specific mutations favor virus spread in the brain. These studies will be done in cultivated brain cells and in clusters of cells resembling the brain called organoids. This knowledge may help in creating effective antiviral drugs to combat virus spread in the brain. However, pharmacological intervention in advanced disease stages is challenging. Preventing SSPE through measles vaccination remains the best method.</p>

<p>The<a href="http://www.minnesotapartnership.info/"> </a><a href="http://www.minnesotapartnership.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minnesota Partnership for Biotechnology and Medical Genomics (MNP)</a> has announced its five research awardees for 2023. MNP is funded by the State of Minnesota and provides support for innovative research conducted by collaborative teams from the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Totaling $6.75 million, this year’s awards support innovative projects on cancer, rare genetic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive aging and new health models to study diseases.</p>



<p>The award-winning projects are:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Minnesota Functional Omics Resource (MNFORce)</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic; Mark Osborn, Ph.D., University of Minnesota</p>



<p>Rare genetic disease is a significant health burden for patients, their families and communities. Only 5% of rare disease patients have access to a therapeutic option to treat their condition. In this study, clinical and basic biological experts at Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota will unite to address diagnostic and therapeutic challenges using preclinical models. Creating these connections can provide important insight into the genetics of disease and ultimately improve patient care.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Center for Functional Genomics of Immunotherapy (CFGI)</h3>



<p>David Largaespada, Ph.D., University of Minnesota; <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, Mayo Clinic</p>



<p>Cancer is the second leading cause of disease-associated death in the U.S. The National Cancer Institute estimates that the economic burden of cancer is $21 billion dollars per year. The most used cancer treatments are associated with significant morbidity. Adoptive T-cell therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy, are tailored to specific cases, locations and types of cancer and have the potential to dramatically revolutionize cancer therapy. This project will contribute to the evolution of this young field by providing and testing new T-cell products that could be widely deployed and that are based on donor, genetically modified T cells that could be stored for later use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo-University of Minnesota Research Partnership</h3>



<p>Anne Murray, M.D., University of Minnesota; <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/knopman-david-s-m-d/bio-00027879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Knopman, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic</p>



<p>The risk of dementia is twice as high in older Black people compared to White non-Hispanic people. The high rates of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes in the Black population may play a role. This project will establish a new, large cohort of Black, Twin Cities residents for a study of risk factors for dementia in U.S.-born older Black people, called the “Healthy Aging in the Senior Years (HATS) Study: Cardiovascular Contributions to Brain." HATS will be a long-term, observational study to assess thinking and memory, physical function and general health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organoid Biomanufacturing for Transforming Healthcare</h3>



<p>Brenda Ogle, Ph.D., University of Minnesota; <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/howe-charles-l-ph-d/bio-00083834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Howe, Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic</p>



<p>Organoid models provide a human-centric approach to studying diseases and have the potential to speed up the discovery of treatments. In this study, researchers will create agile, reproducible and physiologically relevant models (organoids) of human hearts, brains and intestines which can be used as tools for understanding diseases, testing new treatments and even replacing damaged cells in patients. The scalable production of organoids for “off-the-shelf” use has the potential to revolutionize how to treat serious conditions like heart damage, dementia, epilepsy and cancer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Towards a Center for Advanced Synucleinopathy Diagnostics (ASCEND): Development and optimization of nanoparticle-enhanced seed amplification assays for blood-based detection of synucleinopathies</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/singer-wolfgang-m-d/bio-20538100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolfgang Singer, M.D.,</a> Mayo Clinic; Sang-Hyun Oh, Ph.D., University of Minnesota</p>



<p>In the U.S. alone, close to 1 million people live with Parkinson’s disease (PD), and globally, the number is estimated at over 10 million. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a related, much rarer neurodegenerative disease that is rapidly progressive and universally fatal. These diseases take a toll on patients' lives and place a significant financial burden on health care systems, yet can be difficult to diagnose, particularly at early disease stages. This project aims to develop accurate and cost-effective blood-based diagnostic tests for the early diagnosis of PD and MSA. This partnership could revolutionize the way we diagnose these diseases, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients, significant health care savings and a brighter future for those at risk of MSA and PD.</p>

<p>In 2017, Cindy Sutherland caught a nasty cold she couldn't shake. After coughing nonstop for weeks, she went to urgent care and got a chest X-ray. When the doctor shared the results with her, he asked, "Have you ever heard of pulmonary fibrosis?" Cindy started to cry because she knew what those words meant. Her grandmother had died of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary fibrosis</a> at the age of 62. Her mother had died of it at 58, and her sister at 48.</p>

<p>The progressive lung disease can be traced to a variety of causes — autoimmune conditions, radiation treatments, specific medications or chemotherapeutic agents, toxins like asbestos or coal dust and environmental factors like mold. Recently, researchers have begun to recognize that a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33935155/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subset of cases can be attributed to genetics</a>. Some patients with pulmonary fibrosis have shortened telomeres, the caps on the ends of chromosomes that protect cells from aging. Identifying these patients is critical because, in their case, certain treatments like immunosuppressive therapies could be dangerous.</p>

<p>"I think it is way more frequent than we realize," says Sutherland’s pulmonologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/carmona-porquera-eva-m-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eva Carmona Porquera, M.D., Ph.D.</a> She is part of a large, multidisciplinary team at Mayo Clinic developing new ways to detect and treat pulmonary fibrosis cases caused by shortened telomeres.</p>



<p>"This is new territory," says Dr. Carmona Porquera. "The good thing is that at Mayo, we can offer genetic testing and telomere testing to our patients to classify, treat and prepare for complications associated with telomere biology disorders."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A rare and complex disorder</strong></h2>



<p>Telomere biology disorders are rare diseases caused by mutations that accelerate telomere shortening. Patients with these disorders are susceptible to a variety of age-related conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, bone marrow failure, osteoporosis, cancer and liver fibrosis. Many but not all patients show outward signs of premature aging, such as premature graying of hair or brittle nails. </p>

<p>Hematologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/patnaik-mrinal-s-m-b-b-s/bio-00093620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mrinal Patnaik, M.B.B.S</a>., first encountered these disorders as a medical resident in the early 2000s. A patient in his thirties with completely gray hair had shown up with a malignant tumor at the head and neck cancer clinic where Dr. Patnaik was training. Doctors there did not realize he had a telomere biology disorder. The patient died a month later from complete bone marrow failure.</p>



<p>"That really hurt me deep down," says Dr. Patnaik. "I felt that there's so many of these patients who are going to be coming into different clinics and if I didn't step up and set up a program for them and educate all my colleagues and set up the infrastructure, we're going to see a lot more patients suffer."&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the help of the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, Dr. Patnaik established the Telomere Biology Disorders Clinic at the Rochester, Minnesota, campus in 2017. The clinic is multidisciplinary in nature, drawing expertise from hematologists, oncologists, pulmonologists, liver specialists, pharmacists, molecular biologists and genetic counselors. To date, the clinic has seen more than 100 patients with shortened telomeres.</p>



<p>"We are among the largest adult telomere biology disorder clinics in the country," says Dr. Patnaik, who plans to open similar clinics in Arizona and Florida.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No perfect way</strong></h2>



<p>The most frequent manifestation of a telomere biology disorder is pulmonary fibrosis, the scarring of lung tissue that can make it difficult to breathe. As telomeres become shorter and shorter, the chromosomes they are designed to protect can unravel and fray, like a shoelace that has lost its protective cap. Eventually, the telomeres become so short that cells stop dividing — a process known as senescence. Those senescent cells send off a slew of chemicals that act as flares, triggering inflammatory changes that damage and thicken the lungs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers hope that by diagnosing and treating the disease earlier, they can improve outcomes for patients.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Ferrer_Alejandro-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379090" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Ferrer_Alejandro-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Ferrer_Alejandro.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Telomere biology disorders are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29976374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typically diagnosed</a> by looking for shortened telomeres and testing for genetic mutations. "There are different techniques that have been developed over time to measure telomere length, and each one has pros and cons," says molecular biologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ferrer-alejandro-ph-d/bio-20503546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.</a> "Basically, there's no perfect way to do this."</p>



<p>One of the most common methods for measuring telomeres involves a technique known as Flow FISH, in which each telomere is labeled with a fluorescent marker and then fed into a machine that quantifies the average amount of fluorescence across all the telomeres on all the chromosomes in the cell. Other techniques involve sequencing to count the repetitive run of bases, TTAGGG, that makes up each telomere, again averaging the result.</p>



<p>"However, it's well-known in the field that it's not that all telomeres get shorter at the same time; it can be just one or two telomeres falling below a certain threshold that can cause disease," says Dr. Ferrer. "If you rely on a technique that uses the average, you could miss those cases."</p>



<p>Dr. Ferrer and collaborators within and outside Mayo Clinic devised a specialized sequencing technique called Telogator to assess the shortest telomere length of each chromosome.</p>



<p>"This test could have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value," says Dr. Patnaik.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Answers, finally</strong></h2>



<p>Even with the limitations of the current tests, the Telomere Biology Clinic is making a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=29804726&amp;query_hl=11&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive impact</a> on patients. Sutherland first visited the clinic in 2020 and learned that, on average, her telomere lengths fell below the first percentile. "Dr. Patnaik said they were the shortest telomeres he had ever seen," she recalls. Genetic testing revealed Sutherland had a mutation in the TERT gene, which codes for a protein called telomerase that is responsible for telomere maintenance.</p>



<p>The Mayo team estimates that they have identified a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33203829/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disease-causing variant in a telomere-associated gene</a> in only 40% of patients. In many cases, they have discovered genetic changes that may or may not cause disease — called variants of unknown significance — and have conducted functional studies in the laboratory to categorize the effect of those variants.</p>



<p>Sutherland says she felt relieved when she learned she had a genetic mutation. "You're always looking for a reason, a cause, an explanation for why this happened. Why did my grandmother, my mother and my sister pass of this horrible disease at such a young age?"</p>



<p>But that sense of relief was quickly replaced by one of foreboding for the mother of five. "I was absolutely, positively scared to death for my children."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Telomere biology disorders are subject to a troubling type of genetic inheritance known as genetic anticipation. The disorder tends to become more severe and appear at an earlier age as the mutation — and the shortened telomeres — are passed from one generation to the next. As a result, Sutherland worried not only that she had passed the condition on to her children, but also that they might inherit a form of the disease much worse than what she herself has experienced.</p>



<p>"These findings have repercussions for family members," says Dr. Carmona Porquera. "We can counsel patients: no smoking, no exposures that can cause more injury, be aware of certain symptoms. And we can start treating them earlier with anti-fibrotic drugs, which could slow the progression of the disease."</p>



<p>Sutherland has been taking anti-fibrotic drugs for the last six years. Though she often feels short of breath, at age 65, she still has the energy to babysit her grandchildren.</p>



<p>Recently, genetic testing revealed no inherited mutations in her family tree.</p>



<p>"Maybe this horrible disease will stop with me," she says. "That would be my greatest wish."</p>

<p>How cancer spreads or metastasizes is a big question for cancer researchers and patients.

They identified a cell-signaling protein that drives pancreatic cancer cell growth that could be a potential therapeutic target.</p>



<p>"Our ultimate goal is to find the triggers for metastasis and stop it.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking inside the tumor microenvironment</strong></h2>



<p>Tumors grow in nutrient-poor environments, so cancer cells must rewire cellular metabolism to meet their energy needs. One way in which cancer cells hijack metabolic pathways is through lysosomes, which function as the cell's stomach and are filled with digestive enzymes. Lysosomes break down proteins, lipids and nutrients that fuel cells to grow. Previous research has shown that amplified lysosome activity is a hallmark of various forms of cancer.</p>



<p>This knowledge led Dr. Razidlo and lead author Omar Gutierrez Ruiz, Ph.D., to look closely at the characteristics of lysosomes in pancreatic cancer cells driven by mutations in the cancer-producing mutated gene, or oncogene, KRAS. Dr. Gutierrez Ruiz collaborated with the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/core-resources/proteomics-core/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proteomics Core</a> on this project as part of his dissertation, and together, they made an unexpected discovery.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Omar-Gutierrez-Ruiz-vert_3x4-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379071" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Omar-Gutierrez-Ruiz-vert_3x4-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Omar-Gutierrez-Ruiz-vert_3x4-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Omar-Gutierrez-Ruiz-vert_3x4-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Omar-Gutierrez-Ruiz-vert_3x4-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Omar Gutierrez Ruiz, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>They compared the lysosomes from pancreatic cancer cells expressing oncogenic KRAS with lysosomes from cells with healthy KRAS to find out what was different. Among the 52 proteins they found that had changed on the surface of lysosomes in pancreatic cancer cells, one protein called dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) stood out.</p>



<p>DOCK8 creates invasive protrusions that act like little arms that can worm through and change the structure of a cell and degrade its surroundings. DOCK8 is typically found in healthy immune cells where it helps the cells navigate and squeeze through dense tissue, aiding the response to and fight against infection. Surprisingly, Dr. Razidlo, Dr. Gutierrez Ruiz and their collaborators found DOCK8 on lysosomes in pancreatic cancer cells.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does DOCK8 work?</strong></h2>



<p>How cancer cells invade and spread resembles how DOCK8 helps immune cells penetrate tissue. The researchers looked at images and videos of the pancreatic cancer cells, produced in Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-cell-signaling-gastroenterology-c-sig/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Cell Signaling in Gastroenterology</a>. They saw DOCK8 using lysosomes to break down the extracellular environment around the cancer cell — helping it spread.</p>



<p>To confirm that this protein is involved in tumor progression, the team eliminated DOCK8 in pancreatic cancer cells using the gene-editing tool CRISPR. They found in a preclinical model that the DOCK8-depleted lysosomes moved slower, tumor growth slowed and metastasis decreased. Then, they delved further and showed that DOCK8 was present in about 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer whose cells were studied.</p>



<p>"Now that we have found out that DOCK8 is regulating the process of metastasis, it could potentially be a therapeutic target to prevent or stop pancreatic cancer metastasis," says Dr. Gutierrez Ruiz, who graduated from&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>&nbsp;in May.</p>

<p>Work on the building began in June 2021 with a lead gift from the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Foundation. Contributions from the Kellen Foundation and other generous benefactors have supported the majority of the construction costs for this new research building. It features flexible facilities for basic and translational research to address serious and complex conditions, with a focus on discoveries in neurosciences and cancer research. The research floors include open, collaborative areas and lab space.</p>



<p>"Our journey to disrupt and revolutionize how we discover treatments and cures and how we deliver healthcare and hope to patients is well underway. We have designed the building to adapt to the evolving needs of Mayo Clinic's patients and foster collaboration," says Gregory Gores, M.D., Kinney Executive Dean of Research, Mayo Clinic. "Through team science, researchers will discover scientific breakthroughs via advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence and clinical trials so cures can reach more people outside our walls."</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic's vision for healthcare transformation demands relentless pursuit of innovations that lead to new cures," says Gianrico Farrugia, M.D., president and CEO of Mayo Clinic. "Through thoughtful team-oriented facilities such as the Kellen Building, our researchers and clinicians will find more ways to detect and eradicate disease earlier, faster and more efficiently."</p>



<p>"We appreciate the vision of the Kellen family and all of our benefactors who made this building possible and who understand the importance of early science. This building will further enable our <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-board-of-trustees-approves-plans-to-transform-healthcare-improve-experience-for-staff-and-patients-redesign-rochester-campus/#:~:text=%22Bold.,greater%20connections%20to%20our%20patients.%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bold. Forward. strategic plan</a> and help us engage new collaborators to join us in transforming healthcare," Dr. Gores says.</p>



<p>The Kellen Building features 11 floors, 176,000 square feet and subway connectors to other Mayo Clinic buildings.&nbsp;The new research facility joins other community and industry partners dedicated to improving patient care, health and wellness in downtown Rochester's <a href="https://dmc.mn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destination Medical Center Discovery Square district</a>, a research, innovation and development hub.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Stem cell-based therapy improved quality of life for patients with advanced <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers and international collaborators discovered in a late-stage multinational clinical trial. In one of the largest studies of cell intervention after a heart attack, patients reported their daily hardship lessened when stem cells optimized for heart repair supplemented standard of care. This clinical study further documented lower death and hospitalization rates among those treated with cell therapy. This research is published in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38006196/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stem Cells Translational Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>"In this era of global aging, people live longer, yet are at risk of chronic disease imposing a poor quality of life. Heart failure is an emerging epidemic in need of new healing options," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/terzic-andre-m-d-ph-d/bio-00084640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andre Terzic, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular researcher and lead author on the paper. "The stem cell-based approach in the present study demonstrates sustained benefit on physical and emotional health in response to biotherapy." Dr. Terzic is the Marriott Family Director, Comprehensive Cardiac Regenerative Medicine for the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Approximately 800,000 people in the U.S. suffer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attacks</a> every year. Damage to cardiac muscle weakens the heart's ability to pump blood through the body, leading to heart failure — a debilitating and life-threatening disease. People with heart failure often suffer a diminished quality of life associated with shortness of breath, fatigue, swollen legs and limited daily activities. Standard of care for heart failure includes a heart-healthy diet and habits, medications, implantable devices, and rehabilitation. However, current regimens do not work for everyone, especially in advanced disease stages.<br><br><strong>The research</strong></p>



<p>The study team recruited 315 patients from 39 hospitals in 10 countries who had advanced heart failure despite receiving standard of care. Patients were randomly divided into groups that would receive stem cell therapy versus those who would not. Patients assigned to cell treatment underwent cardiac catheterization. Then, stem cells taken from their own bone marrow and programmed to heal damaged heart tissue were delivered to the heart. Patients assigned not to receive stem cells had cardiac catheterization without cell delivery — known as the sham treatment.</p>



<p>All participants were asked to complete a 21-question self-assessment at the beginning of the study and then again at 26-, 39- and 52-weeks following treatment. For each question, they rated their physical, behavioral and emotional states on a scale of 0 to 5.</p>



<p>During the one-year follow-up, patients with preexisting left cardiac chamber enlargement consistently reported improved quality of life after cell therapy over those who received the sham treatment. In parallel, lower death and hospitalization rates were recorded among those who received stem cells.</p>



<p>"Data from one of the largest cardiovascular cell therapy trials, testing a regenerative technology discovered at Mayo Clinic, indicate benefit in both quantity and quality of life in advanced heart disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/yamada-satsuki-m-d-ph-d/bio-00028010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satsuki Yamada, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular researcher and first author on the study. "The benefit of regenerative care has been typically evaluated on the basis of clinician-reported outcomes. What's unique in this study is that it was designed to listen to the patient's experience."</p>



<p>This clinical trial was conducted in a double-blinded fashion, with both participants and their healthcare professionals masked during the study assignment. A double-blind study&nbsp;is designed to reduce the risk of bias when evaluating patient outcomes.</p>



<p>Further independent clinical studies are needed to validate the findings of this research.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic seeks to harness the power of cells, tissue and genes by delivering first-of-their kind therapeutics for patients in early-stage clinical trials. Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;is leading an effort that is at the crossroads of biology, engineering, industry and medicine to expand biomanufacturing for rare and complex disorders. Biomanufacturing is the use of living organisms such as cells in the manufacturing of new medicines.</p>



<p>On-site biomanufacturing helps Mayo Clinic validate new biologics in clinical trials, which aim to benefit patients in at least four ways:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong></strong><strong>Addressing the unmet needs of patients</strong></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic is driven by the needs of the patient. Innovative new therapies often originate from physician-scientist research teams who are seeking new treatments for complex conditions such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, kidney failure or cancer.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Allickson_WF782604_0002-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378671" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Allickson_WF782604_0002-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Allickson_WF782604_0002-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Allickson_WF782604_0002.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"With most of the diseases we are researching, there is no therapy available for the patient, or the care that is available is not effective," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, the Michael S. and Mary Sue Shannon Director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "Our goal is to advance cell and gene therapies that go beyond treating symptoms to cure patients. Our hope is to improve&nbsp; quality of life."</p>



<p>Dr. Allickson is also the Otto Bremer Trust Director, Biomanufacturing and Product Development, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Examples of biologics — medicines from human sources such as blood, cells, genes and tissue — are immunotherapies to kill <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood cancers</a> and an experimental, cell-based vaccine to stop the spread of ovarian cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong></strong><strong>Accelerating the most promising discoveries to patient care</strong></h2>



<p>Biomanufacturing provides a bridge that transitions promising discoveries from the lab to first-in-human clinical trials. The goal is to advance technologies that would have broad clinical use for all patients who need them.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Wilkins_WF2365896_0072-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378672" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Wilkins_WF2365896_0072-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Wilkins_WF2365896_0072-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Wilkins_WF2365896_0072.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cynthia Wilkins, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We're manufacturing medicines that we hope will transfer seamlessly to commercial markets," says Cynthia Wilkins, Ph.D., senior director of process development in the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "Working with industry can provide the support needed to move new medicines forward.'"</p>



<p>After validating biotherapeutics in phase 1 or 2 clinical trials, Mayo Clinic wants to license the technology to industry collaborators. From there, those licensees could advance the new drugs to regulatory approval and clinical care for patients around the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong></strong><strong>Increasing collaboration and innovation</strong></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic is expanding its Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) facilities to manufacture experimental medicines on all its campuses. CGMP facilities are clean rooms where drugs are manufactured in aseptic (free of contamination) environments that meet Food and Drug Administration specifications for safety, identity, strength purity and quality.</p>



<p>With on-site facilities, Mayo's biomanufacturing team can work side by side with researchers to address problems quickly and find innovative solutions. On-site manufacturing capabilities also may enable Mayo to circumvent scheduling backlogs and delays that may occur with external contract manufacturers.</p>

<p>"This collaboration gives us immediate feedback on how the biomanufacturing process is progressing. That helps us respond to issues quicker," says Snigdha Rai, Ph.D., senior director of advanced biomanufacturing for the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "If we can troubleshoot quicker and more effectively, then we can get the therapeutic to patients sooner. We want to avoid situations in which we find a problem at the final manufacturing stage and need to start over."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has established a robust biomanufacturing structure that includes process development, quality control and quality assurance to ensure a drug has consistent quality once it is scaled up for production.</p>



<p>"On-site collaboration helps ensure we are not deviating from what the investigator wants. If a change is needed in process development, we are able to connect immediately with the investigator," says Dr. Wilkins. "If we're having challenges transferring the discovery to biomanufacturing, we can readily communicate with the investigator and ask, 'What do you know that can help us fix the problem?'"&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applying a 3-pronged approach to new therapeutics</strong> </h2>



<p>A unique advantage of biomanufacturing at Mayo Clinic is the immediate application it has to patients participating in a wide variety of clinical trials. Physicians work with the biomanufacturing team to help them understand how the process can be shaped to meet the needs of those patients.</p>



<p>"Mayo's approach breaks down the silos. By working directly with physicians, we get to see a variety of medicines for many different types of diseases. That's very exciting. It's different from some other organizations in which the operational side does not interact with the clinical side," says Rai. "That inspires hope we can deliver lifesaving therapies for patients in need of new options."</p>



<p>Education is another critical component that Mayo Clinic integrates into its biomanufacturing strategy.&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>&nbsp;is one of the first to offer a doctorate in regenerative sciences with coursework in biomanufacturing for future physicians, scientists and allied health staff.</p>



<p>Biomanufacturing is regulated and complex. The deep collaboration with scientists and physicians across research, education and the practice has uniquely positioned Mayo to advance new biologic therapies for unmet patient needs.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Patients who received the anticoagulant drug <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/warfarin-oral-route/description/drg-20070945?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warfarin</a> after <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/aortic-valve-repair-aortic-valve-replacement/about/pac-20385093?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement</a> had lower incidence of mortality and a decreased risk of blood clots, according to a retrospective study published in <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00404-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>.</p>



<p>The use of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement has increased significantly during the past decade. Among its advantages is that most patients can avoid warfarin for anticoagulation treatment. Even so, research has been conflicting on whether patients would benefit from more aggressive early postoperative anticoagulation treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers analyzed nationwide data on more than 10,000 patients who underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. Warfarin use was associated with a 32% reduction in mortality risk. Patients treated with warfarin early postoperatively also had an increased risk of major bleeding events.</p>



<p>"The findings support early warfarin use in appropriately selected patients, such as patients with low bleeding risk," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/schaff-hartzell-v-m-d/bio-20053174?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hartzell Schaff, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular surgeon who contributed to the study. "There’s often reluctance to prescribe anticoagulant treatment early after surgery due to concerns about bleeding and uncertainty about benefits. Our research finds that the small increased hazard of bleeding (4% versus 2.3%) may be an acceptable risk given the benefits in terms of mortality risk as well as reduced risk of thromboembolism."</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic study analyzed deidentified patient data from 2007 to 2019 using OptumLabs Data Warehouse, which contains claims data of commercially insured and Medicare Advantage enrollees of all ages and races throughout the U.S. The study was conducted in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/about/overview">Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a>.</p>
