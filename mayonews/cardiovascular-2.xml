<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I recently had a CAT scan of my chest as an evaluation for pneumonia. I didn’t have pneumonia, but I got an unexpected high calcium score in my coronary arteries. Does the calcium I eat affect this? I thought calcium was related to bone health? Now I'm being evaluated for my risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>. Should others in my family get their calcium score?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-scan/about/pac-20384686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary calcium scan</a> is a risk assessment tool that helps your healthcare team recommend if measures are needed to lower your risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>. The scan may show the presence of disease even before someone has symptoms, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/definition/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a> and fatigue.</p>



<p>Calcium from the foods we eat or calcium supplements do not have a significant impact on coronary artery calcification.</p>



<p>A coronary calcium scan predicts your amount of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atherosclerosis</a>, which is cholesterol and other substances that build up and narrow your arteries and can potentially cause a blood clot. Calcium is present in this buildup, called coronary plaque. The more calcium you have in your coronary arteries, the more plaque you have. The more plaque, the higher your risk for coronary artery disease.</p>



<p>The coronary calcium scan starts with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> of your chest that measures calcification in the arteries that feed your heart. It's typically a one-time test that combines a series of X-ray images of your body. If calcification is found, we usually don't repeat the test. If zero calcification is found, we would repeat the scan a few years later to see if the score changes.</p>



<p>Scores must be interpreted in the context of a person's age and other individual risk factors. For the most part, when calcium gets in your arteries, it stays there; it doesn't get removed. But by lowering your cholesterol level through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/cholesterol/art-20045192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diet</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/statins/art-20045772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medications</a>, the cholesterol gets removed and the plaque stabilizes.</p>



<p>Nowadays a calcium score can be derived from any chest CT scan, if no contrast dye is used. In your case, a chest CT scan for pneumonia also showed a high calcium score, even though that was not the initial intent of the test. I commend your healthcare team for using your calcium result to offer you follow-up assessment and possible treatment based on your risk of a heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>Certain people do not need to get their calcium score. For example, for people who already take a cholesterol medication or who have had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angioplasty/about/pac-20384761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stent</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-bypass-surgery/about/pac-20384589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery bypass surgery</a>, a calcium score is not needed. In those situations, they already are taking steps to reduce their risk.</p>



<p>People with a family history of heart disease may want to discuss a coronary calcium scan with their healthcare specialist. For example, if you have first-degree relatives who have had <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attacks</a>, but your cholesterol is not high, a superficial risk assessment may say you're at low risk. A calcium score is going to be able to evaluate risk more precisely and indicate if additional testing should be done. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/fernandes-regis-i-m-d/bio-20305254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Regis Fernandes, M.D.</strong></em></a><em>,<strong> Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix</strong></em></p>

<p>Preventing a stroke is a crucial aspect of healthcare, as about 80% of all strokes are preventable. The focus is on managing risk factors to reduce the long-term risk of stroke.</p>



<p>A stroke results from a blocked or torn blood vessel that decreases blood flow to the brain. In the U.S., stroke is a leading cause of death and disability.</p>



<p>“Because about 80% of all strokes are preventable, we really focus on prevention,” says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/english-stephen-w-jr-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20491968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stephen English</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/neurology/home/orc-20117057?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurologist</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing stroke risks</h2>



<p>Tips for lowering stroke risk include maintaining blood pressure under 130/80 and keeping cholesterol and blood glucose at appropriate levels.</p>



<p>"(Other modifiable risks include) things like smoking cessation, treatment of sleep apnea with a CPAP device, and some other potential treatments," he says. "We want to make sure that the risk factors are mitigated to help reduce the long-term risk of stroke."</p>



<p>There are risk factors for stroke that cannot be changed. These include age, sex, race and family history. “There are four nonmodifiable risk factors we typically think about. The first is age, so age greater than 55; males; people that have a family history of prior stroke; and then people that are of African American descent,” says Dr. English.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I've heard from some of my relatives that heart disease runs in our family, so I've been reading a lot about different conditions. I can barely pronounce it, but what is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> It is a mouthful. Let's break it down a little. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a> (HCM) is a condition where the heart (cardio) muscle (myopathy) becomes thickened (hypertrophied). HCM is the most common type of genetic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiomyopathy</a>. Patients are born with a gene that makes the heart muscle thicker than it should be.</p>



<p>HCM can be a silent disease, and some people live their whole lives not knowing they have it. We sometimes find it by chance during imaging or an autopsy for a separate reason. However, some patients, at some point in their life, can start experiencing increased heart rhythm issues, which puts these patients at risk of sudden death. In 20% of cases, the first sign of HCM can be <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden cardiac death</a>. Making the right diagnosis at the right time is critical in this condition.</p>



<p>HCM also can create stiffness in the heart muscles and block the outflow of blood from the heart. These patients come to us with a variety of symptoms, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/causes/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-fainting/basics/art-20056606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fainting</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dizziness/symptoms-causes/syc-20371787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dizziness</a>. It is important to seek medical attention when you have any of these symptoms. If a young athlete passes out during exercise, for example, it's important that they get checked by getting an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram</a> (ECG or EKG) and an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>.</p>



<p>HCM is not as rare as people think. Data suggests that 1 in 200 to 500 people worldwide have HCM. The problem is that it often goes undiagnosed or missed. Right now, in the U.S., we believe we've only diagnosed 1 out of 7 of the people who have HCM. We are trying to increase awareness in the community about this disease and make sure that healthcare teams are well educated so they don't miss the diagnosis when they look at the imaging of these patients.</p>



<p>It's important to remember that just because you carry the gene doesn't mean you will develop HCM. Some people show signs of HCM at a younger age, in their teens or 20s, while others can show signs of the disease later in life, into their 50s. Knowing your family history and paying close attention to whether anybody in the family was told they have a thick heart muscle or if a family member suddenly died at a young age are the kinds of questions that can lead to clues if you have a genetic factor for HCM.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, we offer a genetic test for those suspected of having HCM and to family members of affected patients. We mail a kit to the patient's home, and they do a swab from inside the mouth and send it back. Within two weeks, we get the results back and can either confirm the diagnosis or find out if they have other diseases that may look like HCM. Genetic testing can be helpful in ruling out these other conditions.</p>



<p>My hope is for people to think about it when they see patients with abnormal heart sounds or have symptoms that might suggest this condition. When treating patients, we should always ask, "Can this be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?" The eyes won't see what the mind doesn't know, so it's always good to have it at the back of your mind. You really can save people's lives by diagnosing it early and referring them in a timely fashion. We have a lot of new treatments that can help these patients surgically or medically, so making the right diagnosis will improve patient survival and their quality of life. <em><strong>— </strong></em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/alsidawi-said-m-d/bio-20516525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Said Alsidawi, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic</em></strong></p>

They even worked out a healthy eating plan, and you want to stick to it. And you do well for many days, but then something upsetting happens, and your first thought is food.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047342?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emotional eating</a> is eating to suppress or soothe negative emotions, such as stress, anger, fear, boredom, sadness and loneliness. Food also can be a distraction. If you're worried about an upcoming event or stewing over a conflict, for instance, you may focus on eating comfort food instead of dealing with the painful situation. </p>



<p>Emotional eating often leads to eating too much, especially overeating foods that are sweet, fatty and high in calories. And this can sabotage your weight-loss efforts. </p>



<p>When negative emotions threaten to trigger emotional eating, try these nine tips to stay on track:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Keep a food diary.<br></strong>Write down what you eat, how much you eat, when you eat, how you're feeling when you eat and how hungry you are. Over time, you might see patterns that reveal the connection between mood and food.</li><li><strong>Tame your stress.<br></strong>If stress contributes to your emotional eating, try a stress management technique, such as yoga, meditation or deep breathing.</li><li><strong>Have a hunger reality check.<br></strong>Is your hunger physical or emotional? If you ate just a few hours ago and don't have a rumbling stomach, you're probably not hungry. Give the craving time to pass.</li><li><strong>Get support.<br></strong>You're more likely to give in to emotional eating if you lack a good support network. Lean on family and friends, or consider joining a support group.</li><li><strong>Fight boredom.<br></strong>Instead of snacking when you're not hungry, distract yourself and substitute a healthier behavior. Take a walk, watch a movie, play with your pet, listen to music, read, surf the internet or call a friend.</li><li><strong>Remove temptation.<br></strong>Don't keep hard-to-resist comfort foods in your home. And if you feel angry or blue, postpone your trip to the grocery store until your emotions are in check.</li><li><strong>Don't deprive yourself.<br></strong>When trying to lose weight, you might limit calories too much, eat the same foods repeatedly and banish treats. This may just increase your food cravings, especially in response to emotions. Eat satisfying amounts of healthier foods, enjoy an occasional treat and get plenty of variety to curb cravings.</li><li><strong>Snack healthy.<br></strong>If you feel the urge to eat between meals, choose a healthy snack, such as fresh fruit, vegetables with low-fat dip, nuts or unbuttered popcorn. Or try lower-calorie versions of your favorite foods to see if they satisfy your craving.</li><li><strong>Learn from setbacks.<br></strong>If you have an episode of emotional eating, forgive yourself and start fresh the next day. Try to learn from the experience and plan for how you can prevent it in the future. Focus on the positive changes you're making in your eating habits and give yourself credit for making changes that will lead to better health.</li></ul>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A recent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> study suggests that active workstations incorporating a walking pad, bike, stepper and/or standing desk are successful strategies for reducing sedentary time and improving mental cognition at work without reducing job performance. Extended sedentary behavior, whether at work or home, increases a person's risk of preventable <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351916?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic diseases</a>.</p>



<p>"Our findings suggest that it is feasible to blend movement with office work that previously would have been done during long periods of sitting. Active workstations may offer a way to potentially improve cognitive performance and overall health, simply by moving at work," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, a preventive cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study.</p>



<p>The research involved 44 participants in a randomized clinical trial where four office settings were evaluated over four consecutive days at Mayo Clinic's Dan Abraham Healthy Living Center. Study findings are published in the <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.031228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Heart Association</a>. The settings included a stationary or sitting station on the first day, followed by three active workstations (standing, walking or using a stepper) in a randomized order. Researchers analyzed participants' neurocognitive function based on 11 assessments that evaluated reasoning, short-term memory and concentration. Fine motor skills were assessed through an online typing speed test and other tests. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When participants used the active workstations, their brain function either improved or stayed the same, and their typing speed slowed down only a bit. However, the accuracy of their typing was not affected.&nbsp;The study revealed improved reasoning scores when standing, stepping and walking as compared with sitting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Being sedentary is the new smoking when it comes to your cardiovascular health, and office workers may spend a large part of their eight-hour workday sitting at a computer screen and keyboard. These findings indicate that there are more ways to do that work while remaining productive and mentally sharp. We would do well to consider an active workstation in the prescription for prevention and treatment of conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>When you think of high blood pressure, you probably already know that it can cause cardiovascular diseases. But that's not all.</p>



<p>"It also can lead to chronic kidney disease," says Dr. Porter.</p>



<p>He says high blood pressure can cause the kidneys' blood vessels to weaken and damage the kidneys.</p>

<p>"As chronic kidney disease develops, many people will develop hypertension, they seem to go hand in hand. Conversely, people with hypertension develop chronic kidney disease as well," says Dr. Porter. "Control of high blood pressure is one of the most important things we can do when someone has chronic kidney disease."</p>



<p>And how you control it, mostly involves lifestyle changes.</p>



<p>"The thing about high blood pressure is it responds to many of the things we do in our lifestyle: regular exercise, avoiding processed foods, reduction of our sodium intake, more fruits and vegetables in our regular diet," says Dr. Porter. "Sometimes those lifestyle changes aren't enough. And these are the patients that need medications to help with blood pressure control. But we can make a huge impact with the decisions we make in our lifestyle to control blood pressure."</p>

<p><em>Mayo Clinic research finds a connection between Social Network Index score and AI-determined biological age</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new study from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> finds that socially isolated people are more likely to show signs of being biologically older than their age and more likely to die from a variety of causes. The research, published in the <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2024.100890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Advances</a>, suggests that social connection plays an important role in overall physical health and longevity, and it should be addressed as a necessary part of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/socialdeterminants/faq.html#what-are-social-determinants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social determinants of health</a>.</p>



<p>To investigate the role of social contact in biological aging, the researchers compared the Social Network Index and AI-enabled <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram</a> (AI-ECG)-predicted age gaps of over 280,000 adults who received outpatient care between June 2019 and March 2022. Eligible participants completed a questionnaire on the social determinants of health and had AI-ECG records independent of the study on file within one year.</p>



<p>An AI-ECG model developed at Mayo Clinic was used to estimate biological age, which was then compared to chronological age. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ai-enabled-ekgs-find-difference-between-numerical-age-and-biological-age-significantly-affects-health-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Previous research</a> shows that the AI-ECG age prediction represents the heart's biological age. A positive age gap indicates accelerated biological aging, while a negative value suggests slower biological aging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers assessed social isolation using the Social Network Index, which asks six distinct multiple-choice questions related to these areas of social interaction:</p>



<ul>
<li>Belonging to any social club or organization.</li>



<li>Frequency of participating in social activities per year.</li>



<li>Frequency of talking on the telephone with family and friends per week.</li>



<li>Frequency of attending church or religious services per year.</li>



<li>Frequency of getting together with friends or family in person per week.</li>



<li>Marital status or living with a partner.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each question response was given a score of 0 or 1, and the total score tallies ranged from 0 to 4, representing varying degrees of social isolation.</p>



<p>Participants with a higher Social Network Index score — indicating a better social network — had a smaller AI-ECG age gap, and that held true across all gender and age groups. Social network status significantly influenced mortality risk. During the two-year follow-up period, approximately 5% of the participants died. Those who had low social index scores less than or equal to 1 had the highest risk of death compared to other groups.</p>



<p>While the participants were 86.3% non-Hispanic white, the study data point to existing health disparities. Non-white participants had higher average age gaps than their white counterparts, especially those with lower Social Network Index scores.</p>



<p>"This study highlights the critical interplay between social isolation, health and aging," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lerman-amir-m-d/bio-00078051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amir Lerman, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the paper. "Social isolation combined with demographic and medical conditions appears to be a significant risk factor for accelerated aging. But we also know that people can change their behavior — have more social interaction, exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, get adequate sleep, etc. Making and sustaining these changes may go a long way toward improving overall health."</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease kills more Americans than any other condition. However, African Americans are at a greater risk for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-hypertension-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-black-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease </a>and stroke than any other racial group, according to the <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/what-is-cardiovascular-disease/african-americans-and-heart-disease-stroke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Heart Association</a>.</p>



<p>There are several contributing factors, including genetics, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-why-southern-food-is-linked-to-high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension,</a> obesity and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Type 2 diabetes</a>.&nbsp;Diet can play a key role in the development of heart disease and its risk factors. This is particularly true for Black people in the U.S., for whom traditional dishes, often referred to as "soul food," were often developed from unhealthy ingredients — by necessity.</p>



<p>During slavery, enslaved people were given leftovers and undesirable portions of meat. Over time, these foods have evolved and have become a part of African American cuisine, according to <a href="https://www.blackfoodie.co/the-humble-history-of-soul-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Foodie</a>. But some Southern foods can put you at risk for heart disease, depending on how often you eat them and how the dishes are prepared.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/brewer-laprincess-c-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20415346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. LaPrincess Brewer</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, says simple dietary changes can help improve heart health.</p>

<p>Savory dishes, like collard greens with ham hocks and black-eyed peas, are part of African American cuisine and deeply rooted in Southern tradition.</p>



<p>"Food is very important to us," says Dr. Brewer.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some soul foods can put you at risk for heart disease</h3>



<p>But soul food is sometimes loaded with sodium, sugar and fat, which makes those foods high in flavor but can also raise your risk of heart disease. Dr. LaPrincess Brewer suggests that people make subtle changes to their diet.</p>



<p>"Focus on portion control, lower fat, lower sodium content, and really focus on the fresh foods, so fresh fruits and vegetables, and integrate those into your diet," explains Dr. Brewer.</p>



<p>Instead of ham, use smoked turkey meat and natural seasonings like oregano and cumin, which can add flavor without all the sodium and fat.</p>



<p>"We may need to revamp how we prepare them by substituting more healthier ingredients so that we can live healthier but still preserve our culture," says Dr. Brewer.</p>

<p>Eau Claire, Wis. — Most people have heard of heart attacks occurring because of a blocked coronary artery. But the body has two types of artery systems: the coronary artery system, which relates to the heart, and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/peripheral-artery-disease-can-signal-cardiovascular-trouble-for-heart-brain-and-legs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peripheral artery system</a>, which involves the arteries carrying oxygenated blood to the arms, legs, brain and the rest of the body.</p>



<p>"Just like coronary arteries, peripheral arteries can become diseased," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/michel-barsoum-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michel Barsoum, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/cardiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/vascular-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vascular medicine</a> specialist at Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/chippewa-falls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chippewa Falls</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eau Claire</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/rice-lake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rice Lake</a>, Wisconsin. "This condition, called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-is-peripheral-artery-disease-diagnosed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peripheral artery disease,</a> or PAD, narrows arteries and reduces blood flow due to a buildup of fatty and calcium deposits on the artery walls."</p>



<p>This can cause claudication, which is muscle pain and cramping when a person is active but usually disappears after a few minutes of rest.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risk factors for peripheral artery disease</h3>



<p>"So who is at risk of peripheral artery disease? People who smoke or have diabetes at any age are at the greatest risk," says Dr. Barsoum.</p>



<p><strong>Other risk factors include:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Body mass index&nbsp;over 30.</li>



<li>Family history&nbsp;of PAD, heart disease or stroke.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High blood pressure</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High cholesterol</a>.</li>



<li>Increasing age, especially if you are 65 or older.<br></li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Symptoms include:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aching or cramping in the arms when knitting, writing or performing other manual tasks.</li>



<li>Change in the color of your leg or arm.</li>



<li>Coldness of the lower leg or foot even after walking in a warm weather.</li>



<li>Sores on the toes, feet or leg that don't heal.</li>



<li>Weakening pulse in the foot.</li>



<li>Erectile dysfunction in men.</li>

<p>"If neck arteries to your brain are affected, symptoms may include difficulty talking, weakness in the arms and legs, or loss of vision," says Dr. Barsoum. "If you experience any of these symptoms, make an appointment with a vascular medicine specialist, who will conduct a physical exam and record your health history."</p>



<p>The exam will include finding a pulse in the affected neck artery and comparing it with the pulse in the unaffected neck artery. Vascular medicine specialists have a wide range of tools available, depending on the degree of your symptoms, to help you return to the activities you love.</p>



<p>For example, if you can walk a few blocks with only mild pain, they may prescribe medications such as aspirin, statins or blood thinners. They also may discuss ways you can modify your risk factors, including quitting smoking; controlling blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes; and increasing your activity level.</p>



<p>If you have more significant symptoms, such as not being able to tolerate the pain when walking, a vascular medicine specialist typically will order an ultrasound or a CT scan with contrast, or even an angiogram to determine the location and degree of the blockage. Your care team will discuss a variety of surgical options to deal with the blockage.</p>



<p>"Prevention of peripheral artery disease is always the best treatment," says Dr. Barsoum. "Quit smoking, eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise regularly, keep your blood sugar in check if you have diabetes, maintain a healthy weight, and manage your blood pressure and cholesterol levels."</p>



<p>In addition, if you have one or more risk factors, avoid certain over-the-counter cold remedies that contain&nbsp;pseudoephedrine. These medications constrict your blood vessels and might worsen your symptoms.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A challenge from the beginning</h2>



<p>Promise Garell grew up with a congenital heart defect. She was born with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/transposition-of-the-great-arteries/symptoms-causes/syc-20350589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transposition of the great arteries</a>, where her heart vessels and her heart were not correctly transfigured, preventing her heart from providing adequate blood flow to the rest of her body. Her first surgery to address this was at 3 days old. Throughout her formative years, she says her childhood was normal. She was active and even played sports.</p>



<p>"I was fine until I was probably 8 years old, when the symptoms started," says Promise. "At the time, I was having signs of a heart attack, but it was because my troponin levels were elevated. This would happen sporadically when I was working out or playing softball."</p>



<p>It would be another seven years before Promise would receive open-heart surgery to address these issues. "I think I was 15, and finally, after about seven years of having these issues and being in and out of the emergency room undergoing constant testing, I received an invasive procedure that lasted about 5 ½ hours," says Promise. "Luckily, after that surgery, I was pretty healthy."</p>



<p>In 2020, she married her husband, Andrew, who serves in the Navy. By early 2022 at age 24, Promise received the exciting news that their family was growing. She was expecting their first child. About six months into her pregnancy, she began to struggle. The toll of carrying a growing baby led to complications during her pregnancy, including congestive heart failure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Watch Promise's Story</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/WF3186101_Promise-Garell_Heart-Transplant_Feb19_ExternalV2_MAM-2.mp4"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Promise Garell tells her story</figcaption></figure>



<p>"I was fine for the first couple of months, and then the third trimester came, and my body could not handle the fluid shifts," says Promise. "Due to that, I ended up in cardiogenic shock, which is pretty much where your whole body is just shutting down because your heart is no longer perfusing like it's supposed to."</p>



<p>Promise's son, Paxton, was born 11 weeks early in June. He spent two months in a neonatal intensive care unit. Throughout this time, Promise's health continued to decline due to heart failure. She would spend time in and out of several hospitals as teams tried to determine the best course for her care. Ultimately, Promise and her family made the decision to transfer to Mayo Clinic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic provides new heart, new lease on life</h2>



<p>In early September 2022, Promise arrived at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>. Throughout her life, she says she always kept Mayo Clinic in the back of her mind as one of the top healthcare institutions she would use in the event of an emergency.</p>



<p>"As a congenital heart defect patient or someone with lifelong heart issues, you always keep in mind the right places to go just in case something happens," says Promise. "And luckily, it worked in my favor."</p>



<p>Thanks to a timely military transfer, stationing her husband at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Promise was now close enough to the healthcare institution she often thought about throughout her health journey. "The Navy definitely got us where we needed to be at the right time," says Promise.</p>

<p>Doctors immediately knew Promise needed to be transferred to the ICU, where temporary pumps and medication helped keep her alive until her care team could figure out if she was a candidate for a transplant and if she would survive one.</p>



<p>"When we met Promise for the first time, we realized she was probably one of the sickest patients that we would encounter," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/goswami-rohan-m-m-d/bio-20432467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Rohan Goswami</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant cardiologist. "It was clear within minutes of seeing her she was going to need to be transferred to the ICU. We had a new mother really working to survive to take care of her family."</p>



<p>Two days after arriving, she was added to the heart transplant waitlist.</p>



<p>"I knew the doctors were going to do what they needed to get me on the list, to get me a heart," says Promise. "I think them knowing that I had a 3-month-old son was just as much a motivation for them as it was for me."</p>



<p>Seeking a plan on how to transplant Promise's heart, the team needed more information about the vessels in her heart. "We needed to have a game plan for how we were going to take the heart out, what type of heart we were going to accept, and how we were going to implant it," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/patel-parag-c-m-d/bio-20055567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Parag Patel</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant cardiologist.</p>



<p>3D technology emerged as the solution. Given the complexity of her situation, surgery would not have been possible without a 3D rendering for planning. The 3D team received the request from Promise's transplant team, and within 24 hours, they were able to research, design and deliver.</p>



<p>"Through a multidisciplinary fashion with our heart transplant team, critical care team, cardiothoracic team and cardiac anesthesia, we were able to work together to find out what things would prevent us from being successful with her care," says Dr. Patel. "It became very evident that in order to optimize her care, we needed to know what we were getting into, how her heart position was actually related to her chest wall, and how her vessels were within her chest. So we reached out to our 3D printing team and our 3D reconstruction team and asked them to reconstruct Promise's heart."</p>



<p>The 3D renderings helped the team to quickly establish a game plan. The surgeons were able to reference the model in the operating room even as they performed her procedure.</p>



<p>When listed for her transplant, Promise's team decided to employ a strategy for a donation after cardiac death heart using ex vivo perfusion, also known as "heart-in a box." This allowed the heart to beat while being transported from the donor center, and, thereby, allowed physicians to monitor the donor heart closely to ensure it was stable before the transplant. Her doctors say both hearts — her "original" heart and the donor's heart — were beating simultaneously in the same room prior to the start of the procedure. Organ perfusion systems, such as "heart in a box," have allowed for increased use of donation after cardiac death, where the heart stops beating. Once the heart is reanimated, the function of the organ is assessed for transplant. The system allows the organ to stay warm and metabolically active, extending the time between retrieval and transplant by several hours.</p>



<p>Promise's new heart came from a hepatitis C-positive donor. In an effort to expand donor pools, organs that previously would have been discarded are now saving more lives thanks to a new generation of highly effective antiviral medications that allow for safe transplantation. After the transplant, patients begin antiviral treatment that will eliminate the virus.</p>

<p>"Because of the collaborative approach and high level of communication with each of the members of our multidisciplinary team, we were able to take separate pieces of technology and cater our therapies and tailor it for Promise," says Dr. Patel. "The biggest thing to understand is when we have technology, it provides us more knowledge than what we had a year ago. And taking that technology and taking that knowledge is imperative for us to identify, No. 1: How can we do better for our patients? And No. 2: How can we prevent problems for our patients? And most importantly, how can we do things now that we could not do a year or two ago?"</p>



<p>Promise received her new heart on Sept. 15, 2022. She has since celebrated many milestones, including her son's first birthday, her 25<sup>th</sup> birthday and her first transplant anniversary.</p>



<p>"When you come to Mayo Clinic, they care," says Promise. "They want to make you better. They will do whatever it takes to make you healthy, and I am forever grateful for that. Being on that table as a new mom, as a wife, a daughter, I think the biggest thought was I had to pull through this surgery for my son — if not for myself, my husband, my mom and my brother — for my son. My son needed me."</p>
