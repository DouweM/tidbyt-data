<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (0:59) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/SCRIPT-MCM-Age-and-Joint-Replacements.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Sierra wants to set the record straight about aging and joint replacements.</p>



<p>"The perception out there is that everybody's going to need a hip replacement down the road, whether it's knee or hip, everybody's going to need some form of replacement. That's not necessarily true," he says.</p>



<p>He says it's not aging but anatomy that will predispose people to knee or hip replacements down the road.</p>



<p>"This is a perfect example. This a patient that had a slip when they were very young. See, there's an abnormal shape to the femur. And this abnormal shape will cause damage of this affected bone into the socket that would lead to hip arthritis," says Dr. Sierra.</p>



<p>Joint replacements today are more successful than ever â€” thanks to precision robotic surgery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"And today, with navigation systems, robotic systems, precision is what is now achievable in almost every patient," Dr. Sierra says.</p>

<p>When people retire, they often plan to spend more time with their grandkids, or on activities like volunteering, gardening, traveling and hobbies. Christine Brown came up with something far more epic.</p>



<p>After thinking about what she and her husband, Tom, enjoyed doing together, she proposed that they spend the next five years hiking the 2,190 miles of the <a href="https://appalachiantrail.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Appalachian Trail</a> (AT). Stretching from Springer Mountain, Georgia, to Katahdin, Maine, it's the longest hiking-only trail in the world.</p>



<p>Tom's response was, "Absolutely!"</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Retirement challenge: Tackling the Appalachian Trail</h2>



<p>So in 2018, the La Crosse, Wisconsin, couple laced up their boots, hoisted their backpacks, grabbed their hiking sticks and headed north from the trail's southernmost point. Their five-year plan called for hiking the Appalachian Trail in 400- to 550-mile segments. That schedule meant 12 to 18 miles per day over rough terrain, up and down mountains through all kinds of weather, from sweltering heat to snow and sleet. According to the Browns, that breaks down to 30,000 to 40,000 steps a day.</p>



<p>"It's a physical challenge, but it's also a mental challenge," says Tom. "Some days, you see quite a few hikers; on other days, you're completely alone. Some days, the hiking is challenging, and some days you're walking down a small town's Main Street. You meet people of all backgrounds and ages on the AT. The hikers become a community and are always willing to help each other."</p>



<p>Even before the start of their epic trek, Tom, 63, had been experiencing pain in his right knee brought on by years of work at his excavating and snowplowing business. He'd undergone hyaluronate injections to relieve the pain and help the joint move more smoothly. Those treatments meant the pain wasn't enough to delay or trim back their plan.</p>



<p>Then came May 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A slippery stone leads to surgery</h2>



<p>Christine, whose trail name is Beanbuster, and Tom, whose trail name is Traverse, were hiking the Appalachian Trail as it wove through the Green Mountains of Vermont. It was a drizzly day. They were climbing up a mountain, and the stones underfoot were slippery. A stone shifted, and Tom felt something stretch and pop: the Achilles tendon in his right leg.</p>



<p>The couple worked their way to a hotel, began icing the tendon and contacted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/james-mannion-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Mannion, M.D.</a>, Tom's&nbsp;Family Medicine&nbsp;physician in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Crosse</a>, for advice on caring for the injury. The Browns decided to head home and a few days later, Tom's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/achilles-tendon-rupture/symptoms-causes/syc-20353234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Achilles tendon ruptured</a>. Repairing the tendon now took precedence over his aching, arthritic knee.</p>



<p>To address this critical injury, which turned out to be particularly complicated, Tom reached out to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/charles-nolte-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Nolte, D.O.</a>, his long-time&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/orthopedic-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">orthopedics specialist</a>, who practices at Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/onalaska" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onalaska</a>, Wisconsin.</p>



<p>"This wasn't just an Achilles rupture," Dr. Nolte says. "Tom had a completely calcified tendon, probably due to an earlier injury. We had to perform a complex reconstruction of the tendon, which involved cutting out much of it, then reconnecting it."</p>



<p>Dr. Nolte says they weren't sure if the tendon would heal, much less heal well enough for Tom to return to the trail. Dr. Nolte told Tom it would be a slow recovery. But Tom tackled his rehabilitation and recovery with the same can-do spirit as he tackled the trail with Christine.</p>



<p>"At one point, there was no guarantee if the surgery would hold, if I'd have a drop foot or get my range of motion back," he says. "The physical therapists knew I wanted to be back on the AT by May 2023, so they set up a program that focused on strength, range of motion and stretching the tendon. They kept me on track and didn't let me get ahead of my healing."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time to address chronic pain</h2>



<p>After six months of recovery from the Achilles rupture, it was time to start phase two of Tom's plan to get back to the trail: a total <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/knee-replacement/about/pac-20385276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replacement of his right knee</a>.</p>



<p>"Tom had dealt with his arthritic right knee for years and undergone nonoperative treatments to relieve the pain," says Dr. Nolte. "We planned to do a total knee replacement during his off-season from the trail, but then the Achilles rupture happened."</p>



<p>In February, Dr. Nolte performed a robotic-assisted total knee replacement of Tom's right knee.</p>



<p>"The robot takes a really good, successful procedure and makes it better," says Dr. Nolte. "The accuracy of cuts and component alignment are close to perfect, which reduces pain and speeds recovery."</p>



<p>Dr. Nolte adds that after completing about 300 robotic-assisted total knee replacements, he's seen a considerable difference in the postoperative recovery phase, with patients getting back more quickly to what they love to do.</p>



<p>Once again after surgery, Tom went into aggressive rehabilitation mode, following the plan of his&nbsp;physical therapists, and buying an exercise bike to continue building strength and range of motion at home. His goal was to be back on the Appalachian Trail by early May.</p>



<p>"I want to thank Dr. Nolte and my physical therapists,&nbsp;for all they did to help me reach my goals," Tom says. "They were amazing."</p>



<p>Dr. Nolte also credits Tom with doing the hard work to get better.</p>



<p>"Tom's a highly motivated patient. He did physical therapy before and after both surgeries, and followed his recovery plans," says Dr. Nolte. "Christine is a real go-getter, and he wanted to make sure he could keep up with her."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Postcards to the hometown care team</h2>



<p>On May 5, almost one year to the day since his Achilles injury and less than three months since his knee replacement, Tom and Christine were back hiking a grueling 400-mile segment of the Appalachian Trail, including summiting 6,288-foot-high Mount Washington in New Hampshire's White Mountains during a snow and sleet storm.</p>



<p>"We had two weeks of nice weather," says Christine, "followed by five-and-a-half weeks of rain."</p>



<p>Despite the weather and continual up-and-down mountain climbing, Christine noticed a difference in Tom.</p>



<p>"He had been in pain for a long time with that knee. Pain is insidious, and affects you physically and mentally," she says. "It was great having my cheerful, good-humored husband back."</p>



<p>Throughout their 2023 trek of the trail, Christine sent postcards to Dr. Nolte. He shared the cards with his team members, who took pride and satisfaction in Tom's accomplishments. While the scenes on the cards varied, the message was always the same: "Dear Dr. Frankenstein-Nolte. Your surgery was such a success that you've created a monster. My husband sees a mountain, wants to climb it and makes me go with him. I'm cold and tired. Make him stop. Christine."</p>



<p>Christine will get her wish in June 2024 when she and Tom reach Katahdin, Maine, and officially complete the last 170-mile segment of their epic trek. To mark making it to the trail's end, they're planning to fly family members to Bar Harbor, Maine, for a grand finale celebration of their great adventure on the Appalachian Trail.</p>

<p>There are plenty of frights to go around on Halloween, but a hand injury probably isn't one you'd expect.</p>



<p>"Interestingly, it's the fourth busiest holiday for hand injuries," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kakar-sanjeev-sanj-m-d/bio-20055340?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Sanj Kakar</a>, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic hand and wrist surgeon.</p>



<p>Dr. Kakar says almost one-third of those Halloween hand injuries are among kids 10 to 14. And most of them happen when people are carving pumpkins.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post.<br>Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."

<p>"It's primarily stabbing injuries where the knife may slip, and, so, they can cut things like tendons, which are the ropes that help move your hands," Dr. Kakar says. "But they can also break bones, and also they can burn themselves, as well, with candles."</p>



<p>But Dr. Kakar says most of the injuries are avoidable.</p>



<p>"A lot of people might just go to the kitchen and grab a sharp knife. But there's good studies out there showing that actual pumpkin-specific carving knives [are safer], [because] actually the force needed to injure yourself, is higher if you use one of those than if you use a standard knife," he says. "So I would use a pumpkin carving kit, No. 1."</p>



<p>No. 2, Dr. Kakar says, is to let kids handle designing the jack-o'-lantern, but make sure adults do all of the carving.</p>



<p>And No. 3, make sure you're always supporting the pumpkin with your noncutting hand.</p>



<p>"So if you're right-handed, use your left hand to support the pumpkin and carve from the top down as opposed to the bottom up," Dr. Kakar says. "It's very easy for the knife to slip and go into your hand."</p>

<p><br>Damage to these nerves needs to be cared for in a timely manner to avoid problems. Dr. Noland says if too much time has passed, then the options become more limited for repair and reconstruction.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment options</h3>



<p>The most common&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brachial-plexus-injury/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350241?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surgical options</a>&nbsp;are nerve reconstruction, nerve repair, nerve grafting and nerve transfers.<br></p>



<p>"We treat brachial plexus injuries primarily through the use of what's called a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brachial-plexus-injury/multimedia/nerve-transfer/img-20008552?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerve transfer</a>. And a nerve transfer can be thought of as rewiring the injured nerves with good nerves that are nearby and functioning, but also expendable," says Dr. Noland.<br><br>Postoperative rehabilitation or physical therapy are crucial to healing.<br><br>"That includes what I like to think of as rewiring the brain and training the brain for the new function. So essentially training one nerve to perform the function of another nerve," she says.</p>

<p>When a simple hand movement, such as making a fist or moving the thumb, becomes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wrist-pain/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20366215">painful,</a> it could be from daily overuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"One of the most common is something called de Quervain's tenosynovitis," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>He says it's primarily a tendon problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If you think of the wrist, basically what we have here is that we have the tendons, which move your thumb. And they are covered by this band, and this is natural. We all have this, but in certain patients, they can have inflammation in this area," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>When the tendons underneath this band become inflamed, they can cause intense pain.</p>



<p>"Now, luckily, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/de-quervains-tenosynovitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371337">treatment</a> for this is relatively straightforward."</p>



<p>Hand therapy and wearing a splint may help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Sometimes we need to do a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cortisone-shots/about/pac-20384794?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">corticosteroid injection</a> to decrease inflammation, and most of the times, it gets better. But sometimes we need to do surgery," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>It's an outpatient procedure that involves opening the sheath surrounding the tendon to release pressure, and allow the tendons to glide more freely and pain-free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. â€” Bernard Morrey, M.D., professor, emeritus chair of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Mayo Clinic and former member of the Mayo Clinic Board of Governors, was recently named a 2023 "Pillar of the Orthopaedic Profession" by the American Orthopaedic Association (AOA).</p>



<p>Dr. Morrey is recognized for his leadership, mentoring and lifelong contributions to the orthopedic&nbsp;community. He practiced at Mayo Clinic from 1978 to 2009, specializing in elbow, hip and knee surgery.</p>



<p>"[At Mayo] we became interested in an 'unknown joint,' which was the elbow, and that kind of set me in my career academically, along with hip and knee surgery," Dr. Morrey says in AOA's tribute video. "The career is reflected in the opportunity to help individuals from all walks of life regain their function, which is what orthopedics is all about."</p>



<p>Dr. Morrey attended medical school at the University of Texas Medical Branch and completed his residency at Mayo Clinic. He was named a distinguished alumnus of Mayo Clinic and emeritus John and Posy Krehbiel Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at Mayo. He holds nine patents and has authored 15 major textbooks under four different titles, translated into six languages. He has written over 450 peer-reviewed publications.</p>



<p>Dr. Morrey is the third orthopedic surgeon from Mayo Clinic to receive this national pillar of profession recognition. The others are the late Mark Coventry, M.D., and the late Patrick Kelly, M.D.</p>



<p>More information about Dr. Morrey's recognition is available in the AOA <a href="https://www.aoassn.org/aoa-pillars-of-the-orthopaedic-profession/">news release</a>.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. â€” Don't worry about your hips or knees as you age. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350772?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arthritis</a> in those joints isn't inevitable. Keep doing the activities you enjoy. Those hopeful words come from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sierra-rafael-j-m-d/bio-20054877?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rafael Sierra, M.D.</a>, an orthopedic surgeon at Mayo Clinic specializing in hip and knee reconstruction. Dr. Sierra says there is no need to curtail your activities out of fear that you'll wear out those joints as you age and need joint replacement.</p>



<p>However, certain conditions, such as birth defects and anatomical issues, may predispose a person to have hip or knee problems. Untreated, hip dysplasia and hip impingement are leading causes of hip replacement in people under 50. Having bowlegs, knock knees â€” or other structural issuesÂ­ â€” can hasten the need for knee replacement.</p>



<p>"But it's not like the rest of us have to be worried and say, 'OK, at age 50, maybe I should have my hips or knees examined by a doctor,'" Dr. Sierra says. "In general, your body â€” your musculoskeletal system â€” will let you know when you have issues."</p>



<p>There are no preventive screenings for hips or knees, so pain is a major tip-off that trouble may be brewing. Some people don't even realize they have hip or knee issues until they experience pain doing new activities or movements.</p>



<p>Over the years, innovations in hip and knee implants and surgical techniques have made the operations even more technically precise, Dr. Sierra says. New plastics used in hip and knee replacements are extremely durable.</p>



<p>Changes in anesthesia and pain control techniques have improved the care given to patients before, during and after surgery. More people are having outpatient hip and knee replacement surgery. If you do get a knee or hip replacement, your doctor will likely recommend being conservative with your activities.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Dr. Sierra says avascular necrosis, or the death of bone tissue, remains one of the unsolved issues in hip surgery, with much research still ahead. Also, research continues into abductor tears or tears of the muscles around the hip. Women are especially prone to this condition.</p>

<p>From strikes and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscle-strains/symptoms-causes/syc-20450507?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strains</a> to footwork and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stress-fractures/symptoms-causes/syc-20354057?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fractures</a>, injuries can happen to any young athlete.</p>



<p>Reducing the risk of injury starts with an annual physical to make sure children can participate. When it's time to play, warm up muscles by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/stretching-and-flexibility/hlv-20049447?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stretching</a>, and use protective equipment, when appropriate.</p>



<p>"It's important to try out your equipment before you get into game-time situations to make sure it works properly, so that it's actually protecting you when you're going out there to perform the sport," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>Try to avoid <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/overuse-injury/art-20045875?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overusing</a> certain muscles over others. Repeated motions can happen around <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/growth-plate-fractures/symptoms-causes/syc-20351979?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growth plates</a> and may require young athletes to pause certain activities.</p>



<p>"They need time to rest because they've put too much stress on the area. And without that, they just don't heal," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>If children are injured playing a sport, keep them out of competition until they can be evaluated.</p>



<p>"The worst thing that you can do is get up and try to play through these things and make the injury worse," says Dr. Troyer.</p>

<p>Summer is winding down, and soon kids will be heading onto the field to play their favorite fall sports. But before they can check into the game, they have to head into the doctor's office for sports screenings.</p>



<p>It's generally required that young athletes get a preparticipation exam before participating in organized activities.&nbsp;The exams aren't just a formality. It's to ensure your child's safety and check to see if they are physically able to play.</p>

<p>"It's very important to identify any potential risk that they may be exposed to before their participation in the respective sport," says Dr. Anastasi.</p>



<p>A typical sports screening includes assessing vision, heart and lungs. Sports medicine specialists also will look at the joints.</p>



<p>"Really focusing on all the joints, ranging from neck, shoulders, elbows, and then moving down to lower extremity hips, knees, ankles," says Dr. Anastasi.</p>



<p>A thorough exam also includes going over medical and family history. This will help identify underlying conditions that might put a child at risk during physical activity.</p>



<p>Dr. Anastasi says sports screenings are not substitutes for health maintenance exams. He also recommends young athletes get a yearly sports physical. </p>



<p>"It's a great opportunity to really identify if something is normal or abnormal, and also to help that athlete succeed at the highest level of his or her ability," says Dr. Anastasi.</p>

You have an opportunity to connect with other people," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/soma-david-b-m-d/bio-20135572?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Dr. David Soma</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric sports medicine specialist.</p>



<p>He says there also are emotional benefits.</p>



<p>"So you learn ... that teamwork piece or that perseverance â€” learning how to win, learning how to lose."</p>



<p>He says a way to get your kids involved in sports is to start young by just getting them active and outdoors.</p>



<p>"We live in a society where people want to stay inside and stare at screens," says Dr. Soma. "But get outside. Go for a bike ride as a family. Go for a run. Kick the ball around the yard. Just get them moving and seeing what they like to do."</p>



<p>And don't focus on just one individual sport, especially at a younger age.</p>



<p>"There's really good evidence that you should not do that," says Dr. Soma. "It's best to have a kid in the elementary school-aged years really do multiple sports. Expose them to as many different things that they're interested in as possible."</p>
