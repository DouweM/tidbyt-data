Health consequences can range from a higher risk of early death to long-term conditions that lower your quality of life. And it is not just the physical toll — the stigma around obesity can affect mental health.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shah-meera-m-b-ch-b/bio-20114165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Meera Shah</a>, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist who specializes in treating people with obesity, says understanding and addressing these interconnected health issues is crucial for improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p>"Our primary care colleagues spend a lot of time with their patients dealing with their blood pressure, and their cholesterol and their arthritis, sleep apnea, and urinary incontinence and diabetes," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>She says it's important to step back to look at what these health issues have in common.</p>



<p>"What kind of unites all of those things? It's obesity," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is obesity?</h2>



<p>"There are many ways of defining obesity, but ultimately, it's a condition of excess adiposity – too many fat cells," explains Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>And carrying extra weight increases your risk of certain hormonal cancers such as breast and endometrial cancer.</p>



<p>"It is also a risk factor for certain GI cancers, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer&nbsp;—&nbsp;numerous cancers. And we don't always know why but the link between obesity and cancers is clear," Dr. Shah says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;As obesity rates increase, the reasons are not always clear-cut.</p>

<p>Dr. Shah encourages talking with your healthcare team about your options if you are concerned about your weight.</p>

<p>Active workstations incorporating a walking pad, bike, stepper and/or standing desk are successful strategies for reducing sedentary time and improving mental cognition at work without reducing job performance, according to a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-finds-active-workstations-may-improve-cognitive-performance/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>. But you don't need to spend money on new office equipment to achieve the benefits of an active workstation.</p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-20053705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, explains the concept of "activity snacks" and how they can be incorporated into just about anyone's daily routine.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:10) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/SCRIPT-MCM-Activity-snacks-SCRIPT-SME-reviewed-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Sitting at a desk for hours at a time may make some feel exhausted and unmotivated. If that's ever happened to you, it may be time for a snack … an activity snack.</p>



<p>The concept is simple, after sitting for an hour, take two to three minutes to get up and move your body.</p>



<p>"You break this sedentary status of your body by going to take the stairs for two or three flights, or just do some push-ups or do something that is meaningful in terms of activity for just a few minutes, and then come back and continue your work," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>In a way, Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says those two to three minutes reset your metabolic clock.</p>



<p>"It has been impressive, the biological changes those activity snacks can induce in your cells, in the metabolism of the sugar, in the metabolism of the cholesterol, just by having those little episodes of activity, even though you might be sitting down for the next 45 minutes," he says.</p>



<p>It's a small change that can make a big impact on your physical and mental health.</p>



<p>"You will see how that little thing will even sharpen your mind for the next half an hour, 45 minutes, absolutely," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Cardiologists in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/heart-rhythm-clinic/overview/ovc-20442477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart Rhythm Clinic</a> are using a new innovative energy source to safely and successfully treat a common type of heart arrhythmia. The therapy, called pulsed field ablation (PFA), has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and represents a significant milestone in treating <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a> (AFib).</p>



<p>The irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm of AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart, increasing a patient's risk of stroke. Clinicians can use medication and therapies to help reset the heart rhythm, but some patients have AFib that persists and worsens. Ablation therapy has been used for about two decades to treat these patients, but pulsed field ablation uses a different approach.</p>



<p>Instead of applying heat or cold energy as in traditional ablation, the PFA catheter therapy uses short bursts of high energy called irreversible electroporation to affect heart tissue that causes atrial fibrillation. The PFA therapy successfully transitioned to patient care at Mayo Clinic in Rochester in February 2024. Mayo cardiac specialists have since used PFA to treat more than 200 patients for AFib.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Limitations inspired development of new energy sources</h2>



<p>"The traditional approaches using thermal energy sources to treat AFib — radiofrequency, laser, cryo energy — all carry an associated injury risk to nearby structures, the esophagus and the phrenic nerve," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kapa-suraj-m-d/bio-20055752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suraj Kapa, M.D.</a>, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PFA technology has been in development for more than 18 years. Mayo Clinic's pioneering research in ablative therapy began under another cardiac electrophysiologist and prolific inventor, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/asirvatham-samuel-j-m-d/bio-20053066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel J. Asirvatham, M.D.</a> He had a growing interest in developing novel energy sources that would allow for cardiac-selective impact.</p>



<p>"The principle underlying PFA is that, depending on the makeup of the cell membranes of different types of tissues, certain tissue may have different energy thresholds that may be 'deadened' or ablated while other tissue types may be preserved," says Dr. Kapa. "Research through hundreds of preclinical trials has suggested that PFA of the heart tissue can allow for a heart tissue-specific approach to ablation while avoiding collateral injury to structures such as the esophagus or the phrenic nerve."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research led to the development of two recently U.S.-approved systems to deliver pulsed field energy to the heart. Dr. Kapa notes that both catheters are approved to treat AFib in the form of pulmonary vein isolation and have shown similar efficacy in clinical trials when compared with traditional radiofrequency ablation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of pulsed field ablation</h2>



<p>PFA can lead to faster procedures while reducing anesthesia time and removing some of the risks of traditional AFib ablation.</p>



<p>"Minimizing risk and making potentially effective treatments more broadly available is critical to providing therapy to the largest number of patients," says Dr. Kapa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is estimated that 12.1 million people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AFib by 2030 — more than double the number in 2010. Globally, the number of patients diagnosed with AFib is increasing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"A growing body of evidence supports more aggressive rhythm control with ablation, whether earlier in a patient's AFib diagnosis to achieve better long-term outcomes or in the setting of other comorbidities such as heart failure, in which ablation has shown to reduce mortality," says Dr. Kapa.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Assessing how PFA may be used for other arrhythmias, such as ventricular arrhythmias, is in the works. Early preclinical data suggest that PFA may be superior to current traditional thermal energy-based approaches in this arena. Looking ahead, Dr. Kapa anticipates rapid growth and evolution in pulsed field therapy.</p>



<p>"Within the next year, we expect the introduction of at least a half dozen catheters and systems utilizing pulsed field therapy, each offering new research opportunities and the potential to provide transformative, curative care for patients with arrhythmic diseases."&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Mayo Clinic Healthcare expert explains what it means – and what to do with the information</em><strong></strong></p>



<p>LONDON — Wearables measure several aspects of health, and heart rate variability might be one of those. It may be surprising when your device informs you that your heart rate variability is high or low, but what does it mean? <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/doctors/elijah-r-behr-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elijah Behr, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare</a> in London, explains heart rate variability and how it factors into health.</p>



<p><strong>What does heart rate variability measure?</strong></p>



<p>“It measures the balance of nerve activity in the body and the way it relates to your heart rate and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/blood-pressure/art-20050982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a>,” Dr. Behr explains.</p>



<p>The nerve system that heart rate variability relates to is called the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/autonomic-neurology-subspecialty-group/overview/ovc-20443607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autonomic nervous system</a>. It can be thought of as the balance between the effects of adrenaline in the body and the other part of the nervous system, the vagus nerve, Dr. Behr adds.</p>



<p>“From beat to beat, or over periods of time, heart rate variability can be measured in different ways to try to assess this balance within the autonomic nervous system,” he says.</p>



<p><strong>What does high or low heart rate variability mean?</strong></p>



<p>“In general people who have higher heart rate variability are more likely to have better cardiovascular fitness. Athletes tend to have a very high heart rate variability, for instance,” Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p>People with lower heart rate variability may be likelier to lack cardiovascular fitness or to have underlying heart disease, he explains. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Does this mean people with high heart rate variability have nothing to worry about, and those with low heart rate variability should be concerned?</strong></p>



<p>For people who haven’t been diagnosed with a heart condition and are otherwise healthy, heart rate variability alone isn’t information that a doctor can act upon, Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p>“Heart rate variability by itself isn’t likely to give you a good view of your likelihood of say, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest</a> or other <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas/arrhythmia-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart rhythm</a> problems. It doesn’t provide enough detail to say, `Yes, you’re at heightened risk of X,’” he says.  </p>



<p>Research on heart rate variability in patients who have had heart attacks has not been incorporated as yet into clinical decision making about them, such as treating someone more aggressively, Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p><strong>Can you improve your heart rate variability?</strong></p>



<p>“One could say to a patient that you need to exercise more, lose a bit of weight, get fitter. But these are things that would be promoted for heart health generally,” Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p><strong>Advice for patients worried about their heart rate variability:</strong></p>



<p>“Ignore it as a stand-alone measure. Do use it as a way of pushing you toward being a bit healthier in your lifestyle,” Dr. Behr advises. “Watch blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, exercise; if you’re worried about your heart rate variability, you should be worried about these. They are more tangible risks that can be acted upon and that we know will have an impact on your longevity.”</p>

<p>Eating habits play a significant role in your health. So how much and what kinds of foods do you eat in a week? Healthcare professionals often ask these questions during an exam, which can sometimes be tedious.</p>



<p>"Very extensive surveys of 110 questions or 120 questions pretty much asking you about every single food you had," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic simplified the process by creating the Mini-EAT assessment tool. It consists of nine dietary-specific questions and takes about two minutes to complete.</p>



<p>"When the person is telling you that he's eating fruits and vegetables every day and avoiding fast food, you know just by having those responses that that person very likely is doing the right thing," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>Being mindful of your diet could help prevent heart disease and high blood pressure.</p>



<p>"Blood pressure might be affected by the quality of our foods, and cholesterol too, which we know leads to heart disease," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>With the Mini-EATS tool, healthcare professionals will be able to give patients more accurate, individualized information so they can make healthier nutritional choices.</p>

<p>"Skipping breakfast, historically, hasn't been something necessarily healthy," Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says.</p>



<p>He adds that missing the first meal of the day isn't good for your heart.</p>



<p>"There are numerous studies showing that people who skip breakfast have an increased risk for heart disease and many other ailments," he says.</p>



<p>Not only that, there's also some evidence to suggest that heart attacks are more likely to happen in the morning.</p>



<p>"Part of it is the high adrenaline state that occurs early in the morning. If you match that with no food, no calories at all, what happens is that the body says, 'Well, with no food, I could die from starvation, so I have to do some extra things.' And those extra things are basically crunching the glands that make adrenaline. And essentially, the body gets into this rush of adrenaline," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>And for those wanting to lose weight through fasting, breakfast is not the right meal to miss.</p>



<p>"People who skip breakfast, many times they're able to do that because they have a pretty large dinner," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez. "So you're feeding the body with calories at the time when your body is just about to go to sleep, when you need calories the least."</p>

<p>Johnathan Sederquist isn’t interested in taking it easy. The active 29-year-old likes to work out early in the morning, do landscaping and excavation work for his company during the day, and tackle home improvement projects — like building a new house on the banks of the Hiwassee River — in his free time. He also loves spending time on the river, water surfing behind his boat or riding one of his two Jet Skis, with his friends and family.</p>



<p>When nerve pain started disrupting Johnathan’s on-the-go personality, he didn’t know what to do about it.</p>



<p>Johnathan first noticed tingling and numbness in his hands about seven years ago, while painting his daughter's nursery before she was born.</p>



<p>"My hand would go numb, and I'd drop the paintbrush," Johnathan says.</p>



<p>While driving, Johnathan also noticed cramping and a burning sensation in his hands. And he frequently lost circulation in his arms. "They'd go limp while I was trying to sleep," he says.</p>



<p>Still, Johnathan largely ignored the symptoms, attributing them to arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>



<p>Eventually, Johnathan saw a doctor near his home in Calhoun, Tennessee, who found a cyst near his spine.</p>



<p>"The doctor told me the cyst was causing my symptoms, and that after I had surgery to remove the cyst, I'd feel like a new man," he recalls.</p>



<p>That’s not what happened though. Johnathan still experienced pain even after the surgery. So much so, that, one night a short time later, he decided he couldn't live with it anymore. "I told Mackenzie, my wife, that I had to find a new doctor," he says. "I had to get help."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A second opinion</strong></h2>



<p>Johnathan's friend knew someone who worked for Mayo Clinic. Johnathan reached out to the contact, who suggested Johnathan schedule an appointment at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, which was the closest Mayo campus to his home. When it was time to travel to Florida, Johnathan didn't hesitate.</p>



<p>"They ran tests and figured out it was thoracic outlet syndrome," he says. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thoracic outlet syndrome</a>, or TOS, is a rare disorder that involves compression of the nerves, arteries or veins in the lower neck and upper chest.</p>



<p>It turned out he had bilateral TOS — meaning it occurred on both his left and right side.</p>



<p>Diagnosing TOS is key to treating it successfully, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/farres-sam-m-d/bio-20055440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sam Farres</a>, chief of the Vascular Surgery Division at Mayo Clinic in Florida. But diagnosing TOS is about much more than just running one test. It's about eliminating other possible causes first.</p>



<p>"TOS is complicated because it's a spectrum of symptoms that are, often, very generic," Dr. Farres says. "And TOS is very rare. That's why we have a protocol we follow, to minimize bias and subjectivity, before we diagnose someone with the syndrome."</p>



<p>With Johnathan, Dr. Farres first tried conservative treatments, like physical therapy. When those didn't effectively reduce the pain though, Dr. Farres recommended a TOS procedure called rib resection surgery. Since TOS affected both sides of his body, he required two surgeries, which were spaced apart to allow time for healing.</p>



<p>"Dr. Farres and everyone on his team were great," Johnathan says. "They were willing to keep going and keep checking everything."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Free from TOS</strong></h2>



<p>Johnathan had the surgeries a month apart. After the first one, he recalls waking up from the procedure in less pain than he had going into it. "I kept telling the doctor and my wife that it felt like I could move my neck easier," he says. "I felt like I could almost turn my head around like an elk. One side of my body felt completely different from the other side."</p>



<p>Just 10 days after his first surgery, in fact, Johnathan started running again. "It didn’t hurt," he says.</p>



<p>In between his surgeries and follow-up appointments, Johnathan kept in touch with his care team on Mayo Clinic's patient portal, always receiving quick responses to his questions.</p>



<p>"Dr. Farres would call and check on me," he says. "They did a great job of keeping up with how I was doing. Now, I’ll never go anywhere else but Mayo Clinic."</p>



<p>Today, Johnathan is still running and back in the gym. And he’s spending more time on the river with Mackenzie and their daughter, Kendall, who's now 6 years old.</p>



<p>"The pain and burning in my hands are gone," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Farres says Johnathan and other patients like him describe the before-and-after difference as a "huge burden" being lifted from their shoulders. "You can tell that, for Johnathan, work is his life, so it hit him hard not being able to lift or remodel or do the things he wanted to do," Dr. Farres says. "Now, I think Johnathan feels free to live his life to its fullest potential. He's telling me all the things he's doing. It's very exciting."</p>

<p>Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication marked by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a>, which can affect health outcomes for mothers and babies. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/how-preeclampsia-accelerates-aging-in-women/#:~:text=Through%20a%20combination%20of%20laboratory,%2C%20stroke%2C%20and%20kidney%20failure." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A growing body of research</a>, led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/garovic-vesna-d-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vesna Garovic, M.D., Ph.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic nephrologist, has shown a link between preeclampsia and accelerated aging, which may affect a woman's health well after pregnancy.</p>



<p>This study is the first to show that a history of preeclampsia is associated with increased concentrations of certain <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/science/biomarkers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biomarkers</a> in the body that are recognized as signs of cellular senescence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Markers of aging</strong></h2>



<p>Cellular senescence is a process in which cells stop dividing but do not die. Instead, the cells remain in the body, releasing inflammatory molecules. Senescence is considered a classic sign of aging.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Suvakov_Sonja_MD_PhD_21149704_201808060236.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390015" style="width:250px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Suvakov_Sonja_MD_PhD_21149704_201808060236.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Suvakov_Sonja_MD_PhD_21149704_201808060236-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sonja Suvakov, M.D., Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We suspect senescence may be the pathway leading women to develop preeclampsia, and the process doesn't stop at the delivery of a child," says Sonja Suvakov, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic women's health and nephrology researcher and the first author of the paper. "It continues on, casting a shadow down through the years and making women more likely to develop other diseases associated with aging."</p>



<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32381164/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Previous studies</a> have shown that women with a history of preeclampsia are at greater long-term heart and kidney disease risk and are more likely to develop multiple chronic conditions. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7986688/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This accumulation of chronic conditions</a> is associated with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34391091/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cellular senescence and aging. </a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with the data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, the researchers compared 40 women with a history of preeclampsia to a control group of 40 women who had normal blood pressure during their pregnancies and followed them for six years.&nbsp; They found evidence of increased cellular senescence in women with a history of preeclampsia based on an analysis of three biomarkers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Urinary <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/senolytic-drugs-boost-key-protective-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a-Klotho</a>: This protein is associated with longevity and protects against <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/healthy-aging/longevity-starts-with-better-understanding-the-complexities-of-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oxidative stress</a>, a source of DNA damage, and aging-related diseases. Lower levels of this protein appeared in the preeclampsia group.</li>



<li>Leptin/adiponectin ratio: Higher ratios of these fat hormones, which appeared in the preeclampsia group, are linked to metabolic disorders and accelerated aging. These hormones help regulate appetite and maintain energy balance in the body. </li>



<li><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/what-in-the-world-is-an-extracellular-vesicle-more-from-mayo-clinic-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Extracellular vesicles</a> positive for tissue factor: Higher levels of these particles, which can lead to blood clots and cardiovascular disease risk, appeared in the preeclampsia group. Extracellular vesicles are tiny particles involved in blood clotting; tissue factor is a biomarker associated with inflammation. </li>
</ul>



<p>In the study, women with a history of preeclampsia were four times more likely to experience a major cardiovascular event, such as a stroke. In addition, they were more likely to have multiple chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, chronic kidney disease and depression.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Targets for future treatments</strong></h2>



<p>There are no therapies available to treat cellular senescence in women with preeclampsia. However, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01923-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research is underway</a> to develop treatments designed to specifically target senescent cells associated with diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and a variety of other conditions. The researchers hope the discovery of these new biomarkers will not only improve understanding of how preeclampsia works but will also spur the development of targeted therapies.</p>



<p>"Our future research will explore whether targeting the fundamental aging process will improve immediate and long-term patient outcomes," says Dr. Garovic. "We aim to fill the void for specific therapies."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/about/high-blood-pressure-during-pregnancy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Preeclampsia occurs in 1 in 25 pregnancies.</a> "Banishing the specter of preeclampsia would improve the lives of countless women and their families and transform society in ways we can't even imagine," says Dr. Garovic.</p>

<p>In recent years, there's been a big boost in the beverage industry when it comes to the sale of energy drinks.

<p>They are stocked in coolers around the country. Energy drinks are beverages designed to give you a boost. But can they hurt your heart?</p>



<p>"The healthy heart can handle these chemicals just fine — of course, in moderation. The fragile heart may not be able to," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ackerman-michael-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20053036?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Michael Ackerman</a>, a genetic cardiologist at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Dr. Ackerman led a study looking into the effects of energy drinks on the heart. He warns that while energy drinks may not directly cause cardiac arrest, consuming them, especially in large quantities, can be a "perfect storm" for people with genetic heart conditions.</p>



<p>"Maybe you've been sleep deprived, and now you're taking the energy drink. Then maybe that is going to be the 1-2-3 punch that puts that heart — where normally those chemicals wouldn't have annoyed it — to now where it finally trips up the heart into that potentially life-threatening <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrhythmia</a>," he says.</p>



<p>He says it's not a strong link but a call to be aware.</p>



<p>"It's a call to being alert and aware, and informing your health care provider if you are consuming these drinks," says Dr. Ackerman.</p>

<p>Researchers from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota have published <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/c2dream-framework-investigating-the-structural-mechanisms-undergirding-racial-health-inequities/76ADDAD3F3EEFCBA9E56123E56CB026A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paper</a> in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Science, which provides a new framework describing how racism affects heart health among people of color in Minnesota. The researchers are focused on reversing these disparities.</p>

<p>This framework will help scientists explore and measure how chronic exposure to racism, not race, influences health outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/phelan-sean-ph-d/bio-20035285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Phelan, Ph.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic health services researcher and senior author of the paper.&nbsp; "This will help enable researchers to design interventions that address the root causes of these disparities and improve heart health for people of color everywhere."</p>



<p>The researchers are part of the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-research-center-to-address-effects-of-racism-on-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Chronic Disease Reduction and Equity Promotion Across Minnesota (C2DREAM)</a>. This research center aims to reduce cardiovascular health disparities in collaboration with Minnesota community leaders and community health organizations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking a broader view to reduce inequities</strong></h2>



<p>Historically, research on racism and health has focused on interpersonal racism. The C2DREAM framework takes a broader view, examining how oppressive systems of power, structural and institutional racism, and interpersonal racism work together to influence the social determinants of health and health outcomes. Social determinants of health are nonmedical factors that affect health; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes them as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/priorities/why-is-addressing-sdoh-important.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/about/sdoh/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age."</a></p>

<p>"Our social structures and policies deny or grant access to opportunities throughout a person's life in ways that can affect health," says <a href="https://carhe.umn.edu/team/kene-orakwue-mph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kene Orakwue</a>, first author of the paper and a predoctoral student in Health Services Research, Policy &amp; Administration at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. "I believe these social structures must be intentionally interrogated in order to reduce inequities."</p>



<p>People who experience chronic racism may be affected by factors such as intergenerational trauma, reduced access to healthcare, differential treatment in healthcare settings and psychological distress. All these things negatively affect heart health and can have a cumulative effect over the course of a person's life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shaping research to disrupt racism</strong></h2>



<p>C2DREAM's goal is to find ways to disrupt racism's effect on heart health. The C2DREAM framework provides a roadmap for researchers, including a shared set of measures for different types of racism.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Felicity_Enders.jpg" alt="Image of Felicity Enders, Ph.D. " class="wp-image-389673" style="width:250px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Felicity_Enders.jpg 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Felicity_Enders-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Felicity_Enders-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Felicity Enders, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"In order to change something, we have to be able to measure it," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/enders-felicity-t-ph-d/bio-00093556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Felicity Enders, Ph.D.</a>, associate director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/resources/funding-opportunities/benefactor-funded-research-mid-career-development-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Science</a> and a C2DREAM co-investigator.</p>



<p>The C2DREAM framework guides critical thinking, exposing the multidimensional relationship between racism and heart health and showing researchers how to measure racism's effects on many levels. In doing so, the framework also shows researchers how to measure the real impact of interventions.</p>



<p>For example, says Dr. Enders, a study involving immigrant communities might look at structural barriers to heart health, such as access to culturally appropriate healthy food; institutional barriers, such as access to language interpreters during telehealth appointments; and interpersonal barriers, such as cultural understanding between doctor and patient.</p>



<p>C2DREAM researchers are already using the framework to guide their work. All C2DREAM-funded studies collect common measures of inequity, such as data on housing segregation and income disparities. This makes it easier to compare, share and combine data across studies. It also leads to a more comprehensive understanding of how racism affects heart health — and how to disrupt those effects — across the state of Minnesota.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Refining measures of racism</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The researchers see the C2DREAM framework as only a starting point. Future research will focus on refining measures of structural, institutional and interpersonal racism and expanding the framework to include the effects of cultural and internalized racism.</p>
