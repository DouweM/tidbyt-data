<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a new high-resolution, analytical technique to identify the rare senescent bone cells that are known to drive <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">osteoporosis</a>. Senescent cells are malfunctioning cells that build up as people age or as the result of chronic diseases. Once these cells form, they can contribute to developing diseases and consequences of aging. This new method, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37524694/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed in a paper published in Nature Communications</a>, will enable scientists to better target experimental anti-aging drugs at the cellular level, advancing efforts to find treatments for osteoporosis and other aging-related diseases.</p>



<p></p>

<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Doolittle-Madison-L._21598983_202001200201-250x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-375685" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Madison Doolittle, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p class="has-text-align-left">"Senescent cells are notoriously challenging to identify. With this work, we are overcoming a barrier that has hindered past research," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/osteoporosis-and-bone-biology/faculty-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madison Doolittle, Ph.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic endocrinology researcher and first author of the paper. "We expect this technique will enhance our ability to study these cells in a precise manner, understand the mechanisms of diseases and develop more focused targets for treatment."</p>



<p>This research will inform clinical trials at Mayo Clinic and around the world that are testing experimental treatments for osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s disease, chronic kidney disease and other aging-related diseases. The new technique is already being used to map senescent cells through the National Institutes of Health's&nbsp;<a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/senescence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cellular Senescence Network</a>.</p>



<p>The new technique involves mass cytometry, a method scientists employ to analyze the differences among many types of cells and to identify specific cells by the types of proteins displayed on their surfaces or interiors. To pinpoint senescent cells, the researchers looked for the presence of p16, p21, BCL-2, and CD24 proteins, which control the development and survival of senescent cells.</p>

<p></p>



<p>"The novel, single-cell approach that Dr. Doolittle developed opens up new ways to identify these rare senescent cells not only in bone but also broadly across tissues," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/khosla-sundeep-m-d/bio-00078126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sundeep Khosla, M.D.,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist and senior author of the paper. "From a translational and clinical perspective, this would help in potentially quantifying the burden of senescent cells in patients and their response to interventions that kill or disable these harmful cells."</p>



<p>Dr. Khosla anticipates that future research will focus on applying this technique to identify strategies to improve bone healing and regeneration after skeletal injury.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ultrasound/about/pac-20395177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrasound</a>&nbsp;— a technology that uses sound waves to produce an image — is commonly used to monitor the development of a baby as it grows inside its mother. But ultrasound imaging also can be used to investigate suspicious masses of tissue and nodules that may be cancerous.</p>



<p>Tumors consist not only of cancer cells but also a matrix of small blood vessels, or microvessels, that cannot be seen in the images produced by conventional ultrasound machines. To solve this problem, physician-scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/alizad-azra-m-d/bio-00085586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azra Alizad, M.D.</a>, and biomedical engineering scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fatemi-mostafa-ph-d/bio-00086282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostafa Fatemi, Ph.D.</a>, teamed up at Mayo Clinic to design and study a tool that may improve the resolution of ultrasound imaging. As demonstrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, they developed high-resolution ultrasound imaging software, compatible with many ultrasound machines, that could exponentially improve both the detail and quality of images.</p>



<p>The investigational software, which they've named quantitative high-definition microvessel imaging (q-HDMI), has been evaluated to capture high-resolution 2D and 3D images of microvessels as small as 150 microns, roughly twice the width of a human hair.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 35%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>"If we can visualize and capture the microvessel in the earliest stages of cancer, we can better diagnose and treat it earlier, which improves the outcome for the patient," says Dr. Alizad, who specializes in ultrasound technology for cancer imaging.</p>
</div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="925" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-375671 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1.jpg 925w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1-271x300.jpg 271w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1-768x850.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artificial intelligence helps detect what we cannot see</strong></h2>



<p>In addition, the researchers identified a series of biomarkers representing specific characteristics of tiny </p>



<p>vessels, such as shape, pattern, irregularity and complexity, and packaged them into an algorithm that can sort the image data into benign or malignant masses.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:37% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="481" height="532" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-375670 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical.jpg 481w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical-271x300.jpg 271w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">

<p>"This technology provides a quantitative value that shows the probability of malignancy," Dr. Fatemi says. "It's a tool to extract information in a way that can be useful to clinicians."</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applying it in practice</strong></h2>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-022-01583-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical study</a>, the researchers showed that their new q-HDMI tool combined with artificial intelligence (AI) was able to detect a very small, 3-millimeter-wide, malignant breast cancer mass comprised of miniscule vessels in a 40-year-old woman. Finding and treating cancer lesions when they are this size before they spread, or metastasize, can be lifesaving.</p>



<p>"The questions in radiology really are: benign or malignant? And if it's suspicious, how concerned should we be?" Dr. Fatemi says.</p>



<p>To help radiologists answer these questions, the researchers applied their software and algorithm to further analyze suspicious breast masses from 521 patients who already had received conventional ultrasound imaging. The results were astounding. The new technology yielded a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 100% rate of accuracy</a>&nbsp;in determining malignant versus benign masses, regardless of the tumor size.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="fluidEmbed"><iframe loading="lazy" id="videoidqCtLfFbWcEoampt"  title="3D images of benign and malignant breast tissue masses" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCtLfFbWcEo?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>More recently, the researchers analyzed thyroid nodules from 92 patients. Thyroid nodules are common and it is often hard to differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous ones through imaging. Yet the prevalence of thyroid cancer has increased over the last few decades.</p>



<p>"With conventional ultrasound images, physicians can diagnose whether a thyroid nodule is benign or malignant with only about 35-75% accuracy," Dr. Alizad says. That's why physicians often opt to perform thyroid biopsies, which enable them to more definitively determine if a thyroid nodule is a cause for concern.</p>



<p>The researchers identified 12 biomarkers that can differentiate benign from malignant thyroid tissues. They programmed the AI-powered algorithm with these biomarkers, which sorted the images and had an 84% rate of accuracy. These results were published in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36980774/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancers</a>&nbsp;and highlighted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/news-events/newsroom/how-combination-advanced-ultrasound-and-ai-could-upgrade-cancer-diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>



<p>"If it is cancer, we definitely want to know that. But if we can determine if a thyroid nodule is benign without even having to do a biopsy, that is even better as it spares the patient from the financial and physical burdens associated with an unnecessary benign biopsy," Dr. Alizad says.</p>



<p>The researchers see that their quantitative tool could be particularly useful in parts of the world where there is limited expertise and resources, such as rural areas and developing countries.</p>



<p>They also are collaborating with oncologists to enable them to use the q-HDMI tool to better monitor the effectiveness of cancer treatments and help them adjust therapies for individual patients in real time.</p>

<p>In a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajh.27086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers examined telomere biology disorders, a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by short telomeres. Telomeres are long segments at the end of chromosomes that protect the DNA from unraveling, similar to the small plastic sheath at the end of a shoelace. Telomeres shorten naturally with age but become abnormally shorter in telomere biology disorders. People with these disorders often have bone marrow failure and, for unknown reasons, a high risk of developing blood cancer.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers explored the causes of this increased cancer risk by assessing clonal hematopoiesis in patients with telomere biology disorders. Clonal hematopoiesis is also an age-related event that occurs when blood stem cells acquire genetic mutations that make them divide more rapidly than normal. This creates a growing clone in the blood that can evolve into blood cancer. Approximately 10-20% of the population over 70 present an observable clonal hematopoiesis. However, how these clones evolve over time depends on the gene mutation acquired and the surrounding environment of the cells.</p>



<p>The study found that people with telomere biology disorders often have a high percentage of clonal hematopoiesis. Variants in the&nbsp;<em>U2AF1</em>&nbsp;gene are especially common. In contrast, clonal hematopoiesis that occurs because of aging is associated with other mutated genes.

<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."</p>



<p>Dr Qin's team developed a cell therapy to target a protein known as B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) found in patients with B-cell cancers, particularly those with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a>. The BAFF-R protein is linked to tumor growth. The cell therapy under investigation allows the immune system to quash cancer and target tumors that have returned or have resisted available CAR-T cell therapies.</p>



<p>"Our team developed a method to isolate T cells and tumor cells from blood samples of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We generated BAFF-R targeting CAR-T cells from the individual samples and then demonstrated in the lab that these genetically modified cells could kill tumors using the patients' own cells," says Dr. Qin.</p>



<p>The results of this early research lay the foundation for an important milestone: Mayo Clinic will biomanufacture this experimental CAR-T cell therapy at its campus in Florida. The research team will advance the CAR-T cells to a phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and define the treatment dose in humans.</p>



<p>Depending on the results of the phase 1 clinical trial, it could take 5-7 years for this therapy to become available to patients in the clinic.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic in Florida <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hematology-oncology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, supports delivering new cell therapies to patients with complex medical conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transforming cancer care</strong></h2>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy is a regenerative immunotherapy that seeks to unlock the power of the body's immune system to attack cancer. Patients' T-cells are separated from their blood, genetically modified, mass produced and then returned to their bodies to kill cancer.</p>



<p>The experimental therapies have delivered transformative results — &nbsp;in some cases putting B-cell lymphomas and leukemias into remission. However, leukemia and lymphoma tumors can change over time and become resistant to therapies, resulting in a return or relapse of cancer. 40% of patients have had cancer return within two years of undergoing CAR-T cell therapy. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing on-site</strong></h2>



<p>This BAFF-R targeting technology is the first CAR-T cell therapy to both be developed at Mayo Clinic and biomanufactured on-site. The advantages to biomanufacturing in-house are the ability to adjust doses, individualize treatments and more quickly deliver the cells back to the patient.</p>

<p>"The cornerstone of Mayo's biomanufacturing strategy is accelerating promising new medicines from human sources such as cells to patient care. Biomanufacturing CAR-T cells is a high priority because of the potential to provide healing for patients with few or no other solutions," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, The Michael S. and Mary Sue Shannon Director of the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "We are very excited to reach this landmark of biomanufacturing the first CAR-T cell therapy developed by Mayo Clinic research." Dr. Allickson is also the Otto Bremer Trust Director, Biomanufacturing and Product Development, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is expanding its biomanufacturing facilities on all three campuses to quickly move cell therapies from the lab to early-stage clinical trials. From there, Mayo hopes to collaborate with industry to bring new regenerative immunotherapies to routine clinical care for the benefit of patients around the world.</p>

<p>While the bacteria in the intestine are helpful for digesting food and fighting infections, they have long been suspected to play an essential role in triggering&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rheumatoid arthritis</a>. This chronic inflammatory disorder affects the joints.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a link between an abundance of specific gut bacteria and the triggering of an immune response against a person's tissue. They also found that this happens even before the clinical symptoms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;appear. They published their findings in a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37656793/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;in Science Advances.</p>



<p>"As we age, our gut bacteria and their byproducts change, which impacts our immune system," says senior author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/taneja-veena-ph-d/bio-00027247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Veena Taneja, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic immunologist. There is a known link between imbalances in gut bacteria, aging, and rheumatoid arthritis, but it is challenging to prove this connection in humans. "This research sheds light on the complex relationship between gut microbiota and rheumatoid arthritis."</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:34% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="600" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/MSS_0001342127.jpg-Veena-Taneja.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-374711 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/MSS_0001342127.jpg-Veena-Taneja.jpg 500w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/MSS_0001342127.jpg-Veena-Taneja-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p></p>



<p>Dr. Taneja explains that it is difficult to determine if gut microbiota is the cause of the disease in patients because an autoimmune response&nbsp;precedes the onset of clinical symptoms in patients by one to 10 years.</p>



<p>"The gut microbiome may hold the key to understanding healthy aging, how to avoid chronic diseases, and may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment," says Dr Taneja.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Using a preclinical model (experimenting in the lab and not on patients), the researchers determined that the gut bacteria&nbsp;<em>Eggerthella</em>&nbsp;<em>lenta</em>&nbsp;causes an autoimmune response before the onset of the clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. In that response, the immune system produces autoantibodies that mistakenly target and attack the body's tissues and cells instead of foreign invaders, such as bacteria or viruses.</p>



<p>This same microbe also reduces amino acids such as arginine, citrulline and tryptophan metabolites to levels more similar to that of much older people, who see a gradual deterioration of their immune system due to aging.</p>



<p>In addition to their findings, researchers noted a connection between Eggerthella lenta and higher levels of these autoantibodies in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting the importance of considering gender-specific factors in the disease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Informing patient care</strong></h2>



<p>Rheumatoid arthritis has a genetic predisposition; however, many at risk may not know whether they are at risk for severe rheumatoid arthritis</p>



<p>This biomarker may help diagnose severe rheumatoid arthritis and assess its progression.</p>



<p>The research suggests that clinicians could use measurements of metabolic byproducts induced by these gut bacteria as a marker for the severity of the disease. In familial cases and people harboring rheumatoid arthritis-susceptible genes, the researchers say that sequencing bacteria, autoantibodies and metabolites — especially in healthy females — may help predict the likelihood of them developing rheumatoid arthritis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future directions</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers plan to work on how clinicians can use&nbsp;<em>Eggerthella lenta</em>&nbsp;in their diagnoses, especially in women. They will study whether targeting it using antibiotics or specific genes and metabolites can affect preclinical autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis. They are also exploring the link between&nbsp;<em>Eggerthella lenta</em>&nbsp;and its effect on aging.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disclosures</strong></h2>



<p>The technology has been patented in 11,634,744 "Methods and Materials for Assessing and Treating Arthritis." The patent holders have received no royalties.</p>

<p>"Physiologically, AugMAP can be considered a marker of global left ventricular contractile function," says Chieh-Ju Chao, M.D., senior associate consultant in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Department of Cardiovascular Medicine</a> and the study's first author. "AugMAP is easily calculated from the patient's blood pressure and mean aortic gradient, and we found that low AugMAP is associated with higher mortality in all moderate aortic stenosis patient subgroups."</p>



<p>Aortic stenosis is one of the most common cardiac valvular abnormalities, affecting about 5% of people older than 65 years. For most patients with moderate aortic stenosis, clinical guidelines call only for periodic monitoring with echocardiography, a test that uses sound waves to show how blood moves through the heart. However, growing evidence shows that patients with moderate aortic stenosis have poor longer-term survival rates and could benefit from earlier intervention.</p>



<p>The study looked at 4,563 patients with moderate aortic stenosis who were treated at Mayo Clinic from January 2010 through December 2020. The findings indicate that AugMAP is a better prognostic tool compared to other available measures and can detect early-stage left ventricular dysfunction before a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction is observed. "With this information, we can identify patients at higher risk of mortality with current management strategies and initiate discussion about other treatment strategies," says Dr. Chao.</p>



<p>"Moderate aortic stenosis does carry a higher risk of morbidity and mortality compared to the general population based on several prior studies," says senior author <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/arsanjani-reza-m-d/bio-20163932?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reza Arsanjani, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.&nbsp;"Current guidelines recommend active surveillance although earlier intervention might benefit select patients.&nbsp;Our study could potentially identify high-risk individuals who might benefit from earlier intervention."</p>



<p>The authors say future studies should consider whether patients with lower AugMAP can benefit from earlier intervention rather than periodic monitoring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A recent study based on real-world community patient data confirms the effectiveness of the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE), developed by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology in 2013. The PCE is used to estimate a person's 10-year risk of developing clogged arteries, also known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atherosclerosis</a>, and guide heart attack and stroke prevention efforts. Study findings are published in the <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.07.018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American College of Cardiology</a>.</p>



<p>The new study highlights to patients and clinicians the continued reliability and effectiveness of the PCE as a tool for assessing cardiovascular risk, regardless of statin use to lower cholesterol.</p>



<p>The PCE serves as a shared decision-making tool for a clinician and patient to evaluate their current status in preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The calculator considers input in the categories of gender, age, race, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for high blood pressure, diabetes status, and smoking status.</p>



<p>Using retrospective data from more than 30,000 patients enrolled in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/quantitative-health-sciences/divisions/epidemiology/research/rochester-epidemiology-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rochester Epidemiology Project</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers found the PCE performed well at the community level and with relative accuracy between sexes, across age groups and race. The use of statin medications to lower cholesterol did not change the value of the predictions, even though the PCE was developed before statins became widely available. The tool also retained its accuracy when using measurement factors, such as blood pressure, age and cholesterol levels, that were outside the original risk profile range.</p>



<p>"We have seen the excellent performance of the Pooled Cohort Equation over the years in clinical practice," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-b-a/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study. "The study shows that this tool is reliable, not only in light of new cholesterol-lowering drugs, but for patients who previously were not evaluated with the PCE because maybe their blood pressure was higher or lower than the standards, or they did not fit the age profile, for example. By including patients with values outside the accepted range, I think we can calculate the risk for heart attacks in another 20% to 25% of patients, which is not small."<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>

<p>Lifestyle modification is essentially the mainstay of cardiovascular disease prevention, and clinicians talk with patients about what to focus on to prevent the serious consequences of a heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>"Beyond wellness questions about exercise, diet, stress level and good sleep, the PCE guides the conversation to decide if it's time to talk about starting treatment for high cholesterol or hypertension. With this study, we wanted to provide confidence that the Pooled Cohort Equation still performs well at the community level, and our data supports that," says Jose Medina-Inojosa, M.D., a research scientist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Statins are medications that reduce the amount of cholesterol made by the liver.</p>



<p>"Cholesterol builds within plaques that accumulate and grow inside the arteries, sometimes to the point that those arteries will be blocked," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>And blocked arteries can lead to coronary heart disease. But are statins for everyone?&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The patients that will benefit from taking statins the most will be individuals with history of heart attacks, strokes and other conditions known to be caused by cholesterol plaques," he says.</p>



<p>Diet also plays an important role. Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says to eat less processed meat and more grains, fruits and vegetables.</p>



<p>"The most impactful changes people can make to lower cholesterol will include consuming less animal products other than fish, consuming less saturated fat," he says.</p>



<p>And if your healthcare team recommends medication as well as lifestyle changes?</p>



<p>"Take those medications, check your numbers, be sure that all those factors are well under control,” says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>When Tanner Bommersbach, M.D., and a team of Mayo Clinic researchers analyzed national records of pediatric emergency department visits, they provided essential data to describe the growing national crisis in pediatric mental health.</p>



<p>Their study found that from 2011 to 2020, youth visits to emergency departments for mental health reasons&nbsp;<em>doubled</em>, while the proportion of visits for suicide-related symptoms increased&nbsp;<em>fivefold</em>.</p>



<p>The team's findings were recently published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2804326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Bommersbach, a child and adolescent psychiatry fellow, hopes the study's results will be useful in national conversations about youth mental health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking on a serious problem</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/Bommersbach-Tanner-J._15901441_20220701-240x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-374697" style="width:265px;height:331px" width="265" height="331" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tanner Bommersbach, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Bommersbach has had a longstanding interest in children's mental health. During high school and college, he worked in a North Dakota group home for children with developmental disabilities where he observed their interactions with their psychiatrists. The experience prompted him to pursue a career as a physician. He attended&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine</a>&nbsp;where he found a mentor in psychiatrist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/bostwick-j-michael-m-d-mfa/bio-00027634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J. Michael Bostwick, M.D</a>. Working with Dr. Bostwick during medical school, Dr. Bommersbach became interested in research and took part in studies investigating how people with suicidal symptoms interact with the healthcare system.</p>



<p></p>



<p>After pursuing a master's in public health to learn more about research methodology and completing his residency, Dr. Bommersbach returned to Mayo for fellowship training, where he has continued to conduct research on suicide prevention and epidemiology in pediatric mental health. He was recently first author on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00071-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another study</a>&nbsp;about rising rates of suicidal behaviors and unmet treatment needs among U.S. adults who experience a major depressive episode.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rising rates of illness</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Bommersbach says the study of pediatric emergency room visits expanded upon other studies that have shown rising rates of youth mental health concerns — but the magnitude of the rise in pediatric mental health visits, especially those that were suicide-related, took him by surprise.</p>



<p>The study used data from 2011 to 2020 from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, an annual cross-sectional national probability sample survey of emergency departments. The research team examined mental health-related visits for patients aged 6 to 24 years. Data showed a significant rise in visits across all age groups, sexes, races and ethnicities. But the greatest increase was for patients aged 10 to 14 years.</p>



<p>Even though data were not yet available from 2021 or 2022, the findings did include some data from early in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:29% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/McKean-Alastair-J.-MD_15241271_201406250921-250x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-374698 size-full" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>"Over the last few decades, we've seen an increase in youth mental health issues. COVID likely accelerated and exacerbated these concerns," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mckean-alastair-j-m-d/bio-20149218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alastair McKean, M.D.</a>, a co-author of the JAMA study.</p>
</div></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prompting change</strong></h2>



<p>The findings of the study do not identify why children's mental health visits increased so dramatically, but the authors point to several potential contributing factors, including increased awareness of mental health concerns among youth, improved and increased referrals from doctors, greater willingness among young people to seek help and reduced access to other mental health services in the community.</p>



<p>Of particular concern is the increase in suicide-related symptoms in young people, which increased in all age groups, across sex, race and ethnicity, insurance type and geographic region. The authors point out that suicide-related visits among adolescents accounted for 6.6% of all ED visits in 2019-2020.</p>



<p>The numbers are a call to action, they say.</p>



<p>"The first part of prompting change is having real data, and this study shows that this is a growing national crisis," says Dr. McKean.</p>



<p>"One area that needs to be addressed in a national conversation is increasing access to non-hospital services that can treat mental health issues. Emergency departments frequently act as safety nets for individuals with unmet health needs, especially for uninsured and undocumented children," says Dr. Bommersbach. "My goal is to continue research that will illuminate these national gaps so that we can move toward a national commitment to mental healthcare and expanded community-based services for young people."</p>

<p>As a pulmonologist and genomic scientist,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ortega-victor-e-m-d-ph-d/bio-20520652" target="_blank">Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is leading a charge to breathe new life into precision medicine advancements. His mission is rooted in a deep commitment to health equities and inspired by his grandmother.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"My grandmother died of asthma, and that should not have happened. She was Puerto Rican like me, and Puerto Ricans have the highest severity and frequency of asthma of any ethnic group in the world," Dr. Ortega says. "They also represent less than 1% of people in genetic studies. So, I've made it a life mission to develop cures and diagnostics for people like my grandma, and for all people."&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Predicting disease risks: Polygenic Risk Scores</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/Ortega-Victor-E._14023334_202109070736-250x300-1.jpg" alt="Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D." class="wp-image-374446" style="width:193px;height:231px" width="193" height="231" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em><sub>Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D.</sub></em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In his new role as the associate director for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a>&nbsp;in Arizona, Dr. Ortega is guiding his team toward a transformative future of healthcare, where each person's unique DNA profile may serve as a personalized guide to their health and well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Imagine knowing your genetic predisposition for having a heart attack in your 50s, or if you're in the top 5% of the population for the risk of cancer or diabetes. With this knowledge, you could make informed lifestyle choices and receive screenings to mitigate that risk," Dr. Ortega says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously inconceivable, he says personalized health forecasts, derived from so-called polygenic risk scores, are possible because of new and sophisticated genome sequencing technologies. The complex scores are compiled from a combination of data from thousands of a person's DNA variants. The data has the potential to predict disease risks, such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and specific cancers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ortega says getting to the point where all people know their polygenic risk scores will require a solid foundation of "omics" research and datasets, cutting-edge technologies and further discoveries of gene-disease links — all of which are within his team's expertise and capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Omics is an emerging multidisciplinary field of biological sciences that encompasses genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and more. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's going to take considerable work and planning, but it really is the way of the future,"&nbsp;he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advancing omics beyond research labs</strong></h3>



<p>In the shorter term, Dr. Ortega plans to transition more omics discoveries from research labs to the clinic. Omics data can help identify the molecular culprits driving a person's disease, as well as biomarkers that can lead to the development of targeted treatments and diagnostics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recent omics discoveries at Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine have enabled scientists to predict&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1uPkwEmVIX5wmqGyf2sj0Wkm4_PnbDuAZRpVrywJURD8/edit" target="_blank">antidepressant response</a>&nbsp;in people with depression and discover a potential&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/10/04/mayo-study-lays-foundation-to-predict-antidepressant-response-in-people-with-suicide-attempts/" target="_blank">therapeutic strategy</a>&nbsp;for bone marrow cancer. Scientists have also used omics to pinpoint&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/07/25/mayo-clinic-researchers-pinpoint-genetic-variations-that-might-sway-course-of-covid-19/" target="_blank">genetic variations</a>&nbsp;that potentially increase the risk for severe COVID-19, uncover&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/10/25/research-provides-critical-information-about-the-size-and-growth-speed-of-gliomas/" target="_blank">potential clues</a>&nbsp;for preventing and treating gliomas and unravel the genetic mystery of a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/06/21/scientists-unravel-genetic-mystery-of-rare-neurodevelopmental-disorder-provide-definitive-diagnoses-to-21-families-worldwide/" target="_blank">rare neurodevelopmental disorder</a>.  &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Expanding genomic testing across diseases</strong></h3>



<p>Drawing from his years of extensive clinical experience in treating patients with severe respiratory illnesses, Dr. Ortega is also working to expand genomic testing to a broader set of diseases. He highlights the center's collaborative Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases as an effective model that he hopes to amplify. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases proactively engages healthcare teams across Mayo's clinical practice to conduct&nbsp;targeted genomic testing for patients with a suspected rare genetic disease. He says expanding this strategy to more diseases will help build collaborations across Mayo and educate more clinicians on genomics. It may also ensure the most effective genomic sequencing tests are given to patients, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He points to cystic fibrosis, a genetic respiratory disorder, as an example of how genetic misconceptions and wrong testing strategies can negatively affect diverse populations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"Clinicians might overlook genetic tests for cystic fibrosis in minority groups because of a misconception that cystic fibrosis is most prevalent in people of European white ancestry," he says. "However, the disease can affect various ethnic populations with distinct variants, so they also may order the wrong test." &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clearing the path to cutting-edge medicine for all</strong></h3>



<p>Dr. Ortega emphasizes the importance of collaborations and data sharing to accelerate medical discoveries and improve health equity. His dedication to collaborations extends beyond the walls of Mayo Clinic to other consortiums that share profound commitments to enhancing diversity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The future of healthcare is happening right now," Dr. Ortega says. "But it's much bigger than genomics advancements and innovations. It's about making sure cutting-edge medicine is accessible to every person." </p>
