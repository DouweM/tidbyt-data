<p>Research suggests that the ability to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/memory-lapses-normal-aging-or-something-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maximize memory</a> function may be related to what you eat. Following an eating plan that provides a healthier selection of dietary fats and a variety of plant foods rich in phytonutrients could positively affect your health. Phytonutrients are substances found in certain plants that are believed to be beneficial for human health and help prevent certain diseases.</p>



<p>There's still much to learn about what makes up a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-tips-to-keep-your-brain-healthy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain-healthy</a> diet. Studies are finding that what's good for your heart also may be good for your brain. So the best bet for rich memories is to forgo unhealthy fat and remember to diversify your plant-based food portfolio.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Foods that boost memory</h2>



<p>Diets rich in fruits, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/10-tips-for-growing-your-own-nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegetables</a>, whole grains and legumes, fish, healthier fats, and herbs or seeds boost the brain's memory functioning. Here's more about these <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/eat-the-rainbow-for-good-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powerhouse foods</a>:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fruits</h3>



<ul>
<li>Berries are high in antioxidants that can protect the brain from oxidative damage, and prevent premature aging and memory-impairing dementia. Blueberries are a rich source of anthocyanin and other flavonoids that may improve brain function.</li>



<li>Grapes are full of resveratrol, a memory-boosting compound. Concord grapes are rich in polyphenols, which have the potential to promote brain function.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-wonders-of-watermelon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watermelon</a> has a high concentration of lycopene, another powerful antioxidant. Watermelon also is a good source of pure water, which benefits brain health. Even a mild case of dehydration can reduce mental energy and impair memory.</li>



<li>Avocados are a fruit rich in monounsaturated fat, which improves memory function by helping improve blood cholesterol levels when eaten in moderation in place of saturated fats.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Vegetables</h3>



<ul>
<li>Beets are rich in nitrates, a natural compound that can dilate blood vessels, allowing more oxygenated blood to reach the brain.</li>



<li>Dark, leafy greens are known for their antioxidants, such as vitamin C, and have been shown to reduce age-related memory loss. Greens also are rich in folate, which can improve memory by decreasing inflammation and improving blood circulation to the brain.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Whole grains and legumes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Cracked wheat, whole-grain couscous, chickpeas, oats, sweet potatoes and black beans&nbsp;are examples of complex carbohydrates. Since brain cells run on glucose derived from carbohydrates and don't store excess glucose, they need a steady supply of it. Complex carbohydrates are a preferred brain food, providing a slow, sustained supply of glucose. They take longer to metabolize and are high in folate, the memory-boosting B vitamin.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Seafood</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fatty fishes, such as salmon, trout, mackerel, herring, sardines, pilchards and kippers, are rich in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-big-deal-about-the-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart-healthy</a> omega-3 fatty acids. These have been shown to improve memory when eaten one to two times per week. Omega-3 fatty acids don't affect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and can lower triglycerides.</li>



<li>Shellfish and crustaceans, such as oysters, mussels, clams, crayfish, shrimp and lobster, are good sources of vitamin B12, a nutrient involved in preventing memory loss.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Healthier fats</h3>



<ul>
<li>Olive oil provides monounsaturated fat, which can help reduce LDL cholesterol levels when used in place of saturated or trans fat. Extra-virgin olive oil is the least processed type with the highest protective antioxidant compound levels.</li>



<li>Nuts, such as walnuts, are a source of omega-3 fatty acids, which lower triglycerides, improve vascular health, help moderate blood pressure and decrease blood clotting.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Herbs or seeds</h3>



<ul>
<li>Cocoa seeds are a rich source of flavonoid antioxidants, which are especially important in preventing damage from LDL cholesterol, protecting arterial lining and preventing blood clots. Cocoa also contains arginine, a compound that increases blood vessel dilation.</li>



<li>Rosemary and mint are in the same herb family. Rosemary has been shown to increase blood flow to the brain, improving concentration and memory. Peppermint aroma has been found to enhance memory.</li>



<li>Sesame seeds are a rich source of the amino acid tyrosine, which is used to produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter responsible for keeping the brain alert and memory sharp. Sesame seeds also are rich in zinc, magnesium and vitamin B6, other nutrients involved in memory function.</li>



<li>Saffron has been shown to positively affect individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.</li>
</ul>



<p>Making lifestyle modifications to control your cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure levels, as well as not smoking, taking daily walks and keeping your weight in a healthy range can help preserve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/when-to-seek-help-for-memory-loss">memory function</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Try this recipe that combines brain-boosting vegetables and healthier fats:</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Beet walnut salad</h3>



<p>By Mayo Clinic Staff</p>



<p>Serves 8</p>

<p>Summer is a season of outdoor gatherings, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/8-healthy-tips-for-summer-dining" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">barbecues and picnics</a>, where food is often at the center of the festivities. However, the warm weather also creates ideal conditions for the growth of harmful bacteria, increasing the risk of foodborne illnesses. It's critical that you follow food safety recommendations so you can enjoy hosting and attending these events without worrying about getting sick.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Follow these four simple tips to prevent foodborne illness:</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Wash your hands and surfaces often.</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ws-of-healthy-hands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wash your hands frequently</a>, especially when handling food. Always wash your hands after using the bathroom, changing a diaper or touching pets. Also clean your hands before eating and after sneezing or coughing. If you can't use soap and hot, running water, clean your hands with disposable hand wipes before and after working with food. Confirm that all surfaces are clean before preparing food. Regularly sanitize countertops, cutting boards and utensils.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Avoid cross-contamination.</h3>



<p>When packing a cooler, securely package raw meats and store them separately from other foods to prevent their juices from leaking onto ready-to-eat items. Thoroughly wash any plates, containers and utensils that have come into contact with raw meats or poultry before using them for cooked food. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat and other foods, and always wash your hands after handling raw meat to prevent the spread of harmful bacteria. Keep utensils and food covered until serving time. Flies, other insects and pets can carry germs or salmonella and spread them to your food and serveware if they touch them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Cook food to safe temperatures.</h3>



<p>Bring a food thermometer to ensure meat and poultry are fully cooked. Be aware of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/safe-temperature-chart" target="_blank">recommended internal temperatures</a>&nbsp;for each type of meat. Make sure the thermometer rests in the thickest part of the meat for an accurate reading. Do not partially cook food in advance, as this can allow bacteria to survive and multiply, potentially reaching levels that later cooking won't eliminate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Refrigerate food promptly.</h3>



<p>Ensure perishable items, like luncheon and cooked meats, chicken and salads, are always chilled. To avoid temperature fluctuations, consider using a separate cooler for beverages since people will open a drink cooler frequently. Package and put leftovers in a cooler or fridge within two hours after eating. When in doubt about the safety of any food item, throw it out.</p>



<p>If you develop what you suspect is a foodborne illness, keep a careful watch on your symptoms. While many illnesses can be treated by increasing fluid intake to replace lost fluids or electrolytes, severe cases may require further treatment. Seek medical attention right away if you are experiencing symptoms such as diarrhea, high fever, blood in your stools, prolonged vomiting, severe dehydration or signs of shock or confusion.</p>

However, the CDC says that number may be much higher because people need to be tested for alpha-gal syndrome and there are many healthcare providers who may not be familiar with the emerging disease.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (0:59) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."

<p>"Alpha-gal is a short abbreviation for&nbsp;galactose-alpha-1, 3-galactose.&nbsp;It's a sugar moiety that is found on nonprimate mammalian meats," says Dr. Pritt.</p>



<p>That includes meats like beef, pork, lamb and venison.</p>



<p>"People that have alpha-gal syndrome after getting a tick bite develop an allergy to meat, and, specifically, it's all mammalian meat, except for primate meat," says Dr. Pritt.</p>



<p>That means poultry, fish and seafood are excluded. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/alpha-gal/products.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDC</a>&nbsp;has a list of food products that may contain alpha gal.</p>



<p>In the U.S., you can mostly blame the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tick-species/sls-20147911?s=7?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lone star tick,</a>&nbsp;though other ticks have not been ruled out.</p>



<p>"The lone star tick is named as such because it has a white-yellow dot on its back on the female, which is said to look like a lone star," says Dr. Pritt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the lone star tick transmits alpha gal infection</h2>

<div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Symptoms may start two to four hours after consuming meat or meat products with alpha-gal sugars.</p>



<p>"Symptoms could be mild, such as hives, swelling around their mouth, but it could also be quite severe," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Pritt stresses that the best prevention is avoiding ticks altogether.</p>



<p>Tick prevention tips:</p>



<ul>
<li>When possible, avoid areas where ticks can be found, including tall grasses, bushes, shrubs and leaf litter.</li>



<li>Use a bug spray or repellent with 30% or more of DEET.</li>



<li>Wear clothing that covers your arms and legs to give ticks fewer places to bite.</li>



<li>Tuck pants into socks while hiking.</li>



<li>Examine your children, pets and gear after an outdoor excursion.</li>



<li>Check your scalp, behind your knees, belly button and around your body after being outdoors.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a study of the fascinating interplay between the cumulative effects of external exposures on a person's body and genes. It is called exposomics. Learn why you need to recognize that people are exposed to hundreds or thousands of things per day, and why it’s important to study that complexity.</p>



<p>Featured experts on this week's Tomorrow's Cure episode are <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights?mc_id=global&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=tcepisodeone&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=global&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=185872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Konstantinos Lazaridis</a>, the Carlson and Nelson Endowed Executive Director for Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine; and <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/gary-w-miller-phd?mc_id=global&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=tcepisodeone&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=global&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=185872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gary Miller</a>, vice dean of Research Strategy and Innovation at Mailman School of Public Health, and director of the Center for Innovative Exposomics at Columbia University.</p>



<p>"Genetics has explained a lot, but there’s a gap there," says Dr. Miller. "If you want to explain complex diseases, you need to look at all the things that contribute to it."</p>



<p>"It's not the dramatic exposure that happens once in a lifetime. It's those small events that happen every day over five years, 10 years that created the problem," says Dr. Lazaridis. "How can we reverse that?"</p>



<p>"The exposome is designed to capture as many of the exposures as possible. And it's not just the ones we would think that would be negative. It's the positive ones as well. So when you eat your breakfast, there's a lot of nutrients and vitamins there. That's good. But there might be pesticide residues or plastic residues on it. You might have air pollution or allergens in the air that you're breathing," says Dr. Miller. &nbsp;"We're looking at all the things that people get exposed to. I like to think about it as the compilation of all the physical, biological, chemical and psychosocial influences on our health."</p>

<p>It's normal for kids to feel anxious sometimes. When these feelings get too big and help is needed, experts often suggest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610">cognitive behavioral therapy.</a>&nbsp; According to a recent&nbsp;study&nbsp;at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic, guiding kids through parent-coached exposure therapy can be more effective.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/whiteside-stephen-p-ph-d-l-p/bio-20054748">Dr. Stephen Whiteside</a>, a psychologist with the Mayo Clinic Children's Center and lead author of the study, says exposure therapy helps kids face their fears more effectively than talk therapy, often requiring fewer sessions.</p>

<p>"One of the most common fears that we see is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/social-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353561">social anxiety disorder,</a>" says Dr. Whiteside.</p>



<p>He says it's more than just a child being shy. For instance, they may fear people are going to judge them if they make mistakes.</p>



<p>"It makes it very hard for them to meet new kids and make friends. They're very nervous to talk in class or ask for help when they need it. They don't want to join activities because they're just so shy and afraid that something bad is going to happen," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When exposure therapy is appropriate</h2>



<p>If it is affecting daily life, exposure therapy may help.</p>



<p>"And so the treatment involves helping kids learn through their own experience that what they're afraid of is not as dangerous or not as bad as they think it's going to be," explains Dr. Whiteside.</p>



<p>He says kids will be more successful if they have someone to help them, typically a parent.</p>



<p>"Parent-coach exposure therapy is simply working with kids and parents together to help them learn how to help the child face their fears," Dr. Whiteside says.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal with exposure therapy is simple.</p>



<p>"We help kids face their fears very early in treatment so that we can help them get better as quickly as possible," says Dr. Whiteside.</p>

According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/2023-Fireworks-Annual-Report.pdf?VersionId=61twx_Y4c5dkn6MhfDIT7QhGg2T6Gf1q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC),</a>&nbsp;eight people died and nearly 10,000 people were treated at emergency departments in 2023 due to fireworks injuries.</p>

<p>Of the burns and injuries reported in 2023, teenagers made up the highest rate of emergency department visits due to fireworks, followed by children ages 5 to 9, according to the CPSC. All fireworks, including sparklers, are potentially dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If families are going to partake in firework activities, they must exercise extreme caution. These are highly explosive and can cause <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/burns/symptoms-causes/syc-20370539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burns</a>. If they are going to do that, make sure it's in a safe place, that it's an adult handling the fireworks and have experience with the proper tools," says Dr. Bracamonte. "I would highly advise that everyone use extreme caution and that no children be allowed to play with fireworks due to the explosive nature and the risk for injury."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to do in case of fireworks injury</h2>



<p>If you or a family member do experience a burn or have an accident, take action to ensure prompt treatment if necessary.<br><br>"It's important to make sure that that person is safe and that the areas are cleansed with water immediately. And that, if necessary, you seek emergency evaluation. Fireworks are not just generally fire, it's also a chemical and an explosive. Therefore, the injury can be double-fold with a fire injury and a chemical burn," he adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips to avoid injuries from fireworks</h2>



<p>Talk with your kids about using fireworks and sparklers, and follow these safety tips:</p>



<ul>
<li>Never allow young children to handle fireworks.</li>



<li>Always have adult supervision.</li>



<li>Wear protective eyewear.</li>



<li>Never hold lighted fireworks in your hands.</li>



<li>Don't point or throw fireworks at another person.</li>



<li>Only light one firework at a time.</li>



<li>Watch them from a safe distance.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Fireworks are explosive. They contain chemicals and heat, a deadly combination that can cause serious injury. It's important to have a conversation with children, knowing that when children are out, different activities may ensue. It's important that they are appropriately educated about the risks of playing with fireworks," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Medical advancements help recovery from surgery</h2>



<p>Balancing self-care and caring for others can be tough for patients. Quicker recovery time due to surgical advancements has helped.</p>

<p>"The advances that we've had in technology when it comes to surgical procedures have really pushed the envelope and allowed us to do the majority of gynecologic procedures through a minimally invasive approach," Dr. Wasson says.</p>



<p>Downtime as you recover from surgery can be a day or weeks, depending on the type of procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"But we do want normal physical activity to start even the day of surgery because that really helps maintain strength. It helps maintain normal body function, helps speed along the recovery," says Dr. Wasson.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing for surgery</h2>



<p>Recovery also can depend on preparation. Go in as healthy as you can be.</p>



<p>"The less stress you have, the better your diet is, the more rests that you've been getting, the more exercise — that's going to support your body for the stress of surgery, which in turn is going to help speed along the recovery," she says.</p>



<p>And, finally, Dr. Wasson says don't be afraid to ask for a helping hand.</p>



<p>"After surgery, be prepared for needing a little bit of help, needing a little bit of assistance until the pain and the fatigue lifts," she says. "It's very normal to need a little bit of help, and you just want to be prepared for that."</p>

<p>When it comes to melons, which one is your favorite? Whether it's cantaloupe, honeydew or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-wonders-of-watermelon">watermelon</a>, these summertime favorites contain some sweet health benefits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smart snack, rich in nutrients</strong></h2>



<p>Cantaloupe and honeydew melons belong to the muskmelon family and first grew in the Middle East. Watermelon originated in Africa. All three melons have a wide range of varieties. Look for varieties you haven't tried before and introduce yourself and your family to something new.</p>



<p>Here's how melons stack up nutritionally:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cantaloupe.</strong></h3>



<p>A one-cup serving of cantaloupe has only 53 calories, but it contains 106% of the daily recommended value for vitamin A&nbsp;and 95% of the daily recommended value for vitamin C. It's also a good source of potassium and folate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Honeydew.</strong></h3>



<p>One cup of honeydew has 60 calories, 51% of the daily recommended value for vitamin C&nbsp;and 11% of the daily recommended value for potassium. Honeydew also contains fiber, folate and vitamin B6.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Watermelon.</strong></h3>



<p>Watermelon is the lowest in calories, with 46 calories per one-cup serving. It's loaded with the antioxidant <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/eat-the-rainbow-for-good-health">lycopene</a>, which is linked to decreased risk of cancer, heart disease and age-related eye disorders. It also contains vitamins A and C and potassium.</p>



<p>Because melons are high in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/water-essential-to-your-body-video">water</a> and contain potassium, they're fantastic choices for maintaining <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/6-ways-to-manage-high-blood-pressure">healthy blood pressure</a> levels.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to choose the pick of the crop</strong></h2>



<p>How do you pick the perfect melon? Choose a firm melon with no obvious bruising and one that's heavy for its size, which gives a clue to how juicy it is. Watermelon is best when it has a yellow belly, indicating it could have ripened in the field instead of the store or marketplace. One variety of honeydew melon — the Santa Claus — turns yellow as it ripens. The more yellow it is, the sweeter the flavor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prepping melons and serving ideas</strong></h2>



<p>Uncut melon can be stored at room temperature. Before cutting, wash the melon under running water and gently scrub the exterior with a brush to remove soil or contamination. After cutting into the melon, remove the fruit from the rind. Then, store the chunks or slices in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days. Or, after cutting larger melons such as watermelon, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to five days.</p>



<p>While a juicy slice of melon is refreshing and nutritious all on its own, here are other ideas for serving melons:</p>



<ul>
<li>Add melon chunks to the mix when making your favorite fruit smoothie.</li>



<li>Grill slices of cantaloupe or honeydew on a hot grill for one to two minutes on each side, which enhances their sweet flavor. Serve as a side with chicken, pork or fish or top with a scoop of ice cream for dessert.</li>



<li>Make melon kabobs by threading grapes, melon and cheese cubes onto skewers for a fun snack or easy appetizer. Refrigerate until you're ready to serve them.</li>



<li>Puree melon with a pinch of sugar and a splash of lime juice to make frozen pops. Pour the mixture into molds and freeze.</li>



<li>Infuse water by chilling it with melon slices for a flavored summertime beverage with no added sugar.</li>
</ul>



<p>Try this quick, cool, creamy melon salad for breakfast, lunch or dessert. For a plant-based version, use a yogurt substitute.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creamy Spiced Melon Salad</strong></h3>



<p>By Mayo Clinic</p>



<p>Serves 4</p>



<ul>
<li>2 cups diced assorted melon, such as cantaloupe, honeydew or watermelon</li>



<li>1/2 cup plain or vanilla low-fat or nonfat yogurt</li>



<li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>



<li>1/8 teaspoon clove</li>



<li>1/8 teaspoon cinnamon</li>



<li>Orange zest (about 1 tablespoon) and juice (about 3 tablespoons)</li>



<li>In a large bowl, mix all ingredients to combine. Serve cold.</li>
</ul>



<p>Nutrition per serving (½ cup): 52 calories, trace total fat, 31 milligrams sodium, 11 grams total carbohydrate, 0 grams added sugars, 1 gram fiber, 2 grams protein.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="660" height="370" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow16x9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389784" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow16x9.jpg 660w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow16x9-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>A trip to Disney World in 2023 was an eye-opener for Katie Crow. It wasn't the rides, parades or immersive activities that caught her attention but that she struggled to have the energy to go to the amusement park every day.</p>



<p>"It wasn't the experience I wanted it to be. That's when I knew I finally needed to do something about my weight," says Katie, an endoscopy nurse with Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Crosse</a>, Wisconsin.</p>



<p>That summer, the 36-year-old saw her weight reach 296 pounds. Katie suffered from leg and back pain, had been diagnosed with severe <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/do-i-have-sleep-apnea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep apnea</a>, and her energy was at an all-time low. She also worried about developing diabetes and heart disease, which run in her family. Since 2019, she also had been coping with anxiety and depression.</p>



<p>"The worst part was I couldn't keep up with my kids," says Katie, the mother of three children, now ages 15, 13 and 3. "I was just surviving."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exploring the options</h2>



<p>No stranger to battling her weight, Katie had tried a slew of diets, but none were successful. In the spring of 2023, her primary care provider referred her to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/bariatric-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric Surgery Department</a> at Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse. There she learned about her options, which included <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-skinny-on-weight-loss-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss drugs</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a>.</p>



<p>"I considered the weight-loss drugs, but at the time, some hadn't been approved yet, and given the side effects, they didn't seem like an option for me," says Katie. "But the statistics showing the success of bariatric surgery sounded promising."</p>



<p>Katie hadn't decided on her next steps, and then came the Disney World trip. The trip turned out to be the push she needed to finalize her decision to proceed with surgery, even though she was nervous about the permanent nature of the procedure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing weight-loss surgery</h2>



<p>With the decision made, Katie started her bariatric surgery journey, which included various consultations, a psychological examination and a two-week pre-op diet to prepare her body for the surgery. She also met with <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/kathriena-greenwell-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathriena Greenwell, M.D.</a>, who would perform the surgery.</p>



<p>"Dr. Greenwell took the time to answer all my questions and thoroughly explain the risks and benefits," says Katie.</p>



<p>"Katie was an excellent candidate for surgery. Since the surgery, she's been very motivated in her weight-loss goals, dedicated to the weight-management program and is taking her lifestyle changes seriously," says Dr. Greenwell.</p>



<p>In December 2023, Katie underwent surgery. While her body healed, she was on a restricted diet for six weeks.</p>



<p>"I thought I'd never eat real food again," says Katie. "But I'd made the commitment and was determined to make it work."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="325" height="400" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow-before-and-after.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389786" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow-before-and-after.jpg 325w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow-before-and-after-244x300.jpg 244w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making lifestyle changes</h2>



<p>When she made her choice, Katie knew that this was a lifelong commitment. She decided to track her experience on social media, posting about the ups and downs of her weight loss and the changes she was making. The most noticeable was the pounds she was shedding. In five months, Katie lost 109 pounds and 84 inches off her body. She'd dropped from size 3X to large.</p>



<p>There were other changes, as well. Dr. Greenwell says Katie's&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank">body mass index, or BMI</a>, has decreased from 49.26 to 31, and she no longer is considered morbidly obese. Dr. Greenwell also noted that Katie has stopped experiencing gastric reflux and anticipates that as she loses more weight, she won't require a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine to treat her sleep apnea.</p>



<p>"Hopefully, by losing weight now while she's young, it will prevent her from developing the complications of obesity, including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension," says Dr. Greenwell.</p>



<p>Katie also has seen other personal victories beyond the numbers on the scale. Her leg and back pain are gone, she doesn't worry if a chair will hold her when she sits down, and she delights in shopping for clothes wherever she wants. Her anxiety and depression also have subsided.</p>



<p>"I have more energy than before," says Katie. "My goal is to get down to 150 pounds, but based on the way I feel now, I'd be happy staying at this weight. Bariatric surgery is a tool, but you still have to do the work every day. It requires mental toughness and dedication; I didn't realize how challenging it would be mentally."</p>



<p>For those considering weight-loss surgery, Katie advises researching the process and understanding the commitment you'll be making.</p>



<p>"Going in, you know that you're going to be on vitamins and supplements forever, you won't be able to tolerate certain foods, you need to monitor your protein and hydration, and you have to become a regular exerciser," says Katie. "But ultimately, you have to look at the bigger picture.</p>



<p>"I'm no longer just surviving; I'm thriving. I've become the mom I always dreamt of being," she says. "My only regret is that I didn't do this sooner."</p>
