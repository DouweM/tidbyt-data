In collaboration with Illinois, Mayo Clinic's goal is to empower other healthcare institutions to improve patient outcomes with the strategic use of healthcare insights.</p>



<p>"The fact that approximately 20% of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery have positive microscopic margins requiring a second operation in 2024 should not be acceptable.

<p><em>Due to the weather, the event has been postponed to Monday, Aug. 19. The details below have been updated to reflect this change. </em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic is set to celebrate the next phase of construction of its new proton beam therapy facility with a topping-off ceremony, which will place the final steel beam on top of the Andersen Building. </p>



<p>The Andersen Building, located in downtown Rochester, was constructed to meet the increasing demand of patients seeking advanced cancer treatment. The building, expected to be open and treating patients in the second quarter of 2027, will have three levels above grade and two below ground and will allow for future vertical expansion.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Proton Beam Therapy Program</a> opened in 2015 within the Jacobson Building in Rochester and has since approached its appointment capacity. Today, approximately 1,250 patients receive proton beam therapy per year in the Jacobson Building, which is adjacent to the Andersen Building. Approximately 900 additional patients per year will be treated at the Andersen Building to meet the site’s estimated demand of 2,000 patients who will need proton beam therapy each year by 2032.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proton beam therapy uses pencil beam scanning to precisely deliver high doses of radiation to cancerous tissue while minimizing radiation of surrounding healthy tissue. This highly targeted therapy is ideal for people with tumors close to, or in, vital organs and for young people whose organs are still developing.</p>



<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> A topping-off celebration for Mayo Clinic staff in the Department of Radiation Oncology. Staff will have the opportunity to sign the beam before it is placed on top of the building.</p>



<p><strong>WHO:</strong> Interviews available with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mahajan-anita-m-d/bio-20537779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anita Mahajan, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist and particle therapy medical director.</p>



<p><strong>WHEN</strong>: Monday, Aug. 19.  </p>



<p><strong>WHERE: </strong>The Andersen Building lot, near the project trailer at the intersection of 1<sup>st</sup> Ave NW and West Center Street.</p>



<p><strong>RSVP</strong>: Kelley Luckstein by 3 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 16, at <a href="mailto:newsbureau@mayo.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newsbureau@mayo.edu</a>.</p>

<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/autologous-stem-cell-transplant/pyc-20384859">autologous bone marrow transplant</a>,&nbsp;a patient's own healthy stem cells are used to replace diseased or damaged bone marrow.</p>



<p>"It's an intense treatment that has to be done in the hospital — typically, patients who stay in the hospital for approximately three weeks," says Dr. Ayala.</p>



<p>He says this is the time the immune system regenerates.</p>



<p>"Within three to six months after the transplant, the immune system is expected to be back to normal," says Dr. Ayala.</p>



<p>Patients with autoimmune disorders can return to their lives — most remaining in remission — making this treatment a good option.</p>



<p>"Autologous transplantation is an alternative and effective alternative for patients with autoimmune disease that are failing the standard treatments," Dr. Ayala says.</p>

It greatly increases the risk of serious diseases like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113">stroke </a>and certain types of<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/can-you-prevent-cancer-with-lifestyle-changes/"> cancer</a>. Health consequences can range from a higher risk of early death to long-term conditions that lower your quality of life. And it is not just the physical toll — the stigma around obesity can affect mental health.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shah-meera-m-b-ch-b/bio-20114165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Meera Shah</a>, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist who specializes in treating people with obesity, says understanding and addressing these interconnected health issues is crucial for improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p>"Our primary care colleagues spend a lot of time with their patients dealing with their blood pressure, and their cholesterol and their arthritis, sleep apnea, and urinary incontinence and diabetes," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>She says it's important to step back to look at what these health issues have in common.</p>



<p>"What kind of unites all of those things? It's obesity," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is obesity?</h2>



<p>"There are many ways of defining obesity, but ultimately, it's a condition of excess adiposity – too many fat cells," explains Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>And carrying extra weight increases your risk of certain hormonal cancers such as breast and endometrial cancer.</p>



<p>"It is also a risk factor for certain GI cancers, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer&nbsp;—&nbsp;numerous cancers. And we don't always know why but the link between obesity and cancers is clear," Dr. Shah says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;As obesity rates increase, the reasons are not always clear-cut.</p>

<p>The first few years of your child's life are a time of major growth and development in which the foundation for social, emotional and learning skills is laid. A cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment can disrupt the safe environment and routines that foster childhood development. This can cause distress, affect behavior, and temporarily delay or revert milestone progress.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mctate-emily-a-ph-d-l-p/bio-20520019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emily McTate, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric psychologist who specializes in oncology, explains how proactively supporting your child's development through cancer and cancer treatment can help them continue to thrive and lessen their distress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cancer's effect on child development</h2>



<p>Cancer and cancer treatment can affect&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/child-development/resources/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your child's development</a>, regardless of age. The impact on development varies depending on the age of the child. Some treatments, such as radiation, chemotherapy and other drugs, can have long-term effects on memory, learning, concentration and problem-solving, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/child-care#2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. McTate says, for toddlers, the demands and expectations of cancer treatment add a layer of stress and confusion to learning how to navigate the world. "Two- and 3-year-olds are supposed to be exploring their world and learning how to tolerate and regulate emotions. They're in the thick of autonomy exploration, so they want to be able to choose and do things themselves," says Dr. McTate.</p>



<p>However, a hospital environment can limit a child's newly discovered autonomy and opportunities to build confidence and skills, which can frustrate them. Behavior is often the biggest indicator of how a toddler is feeling. "We commonly see changes and disruptions in behavior, sleep and moods," says Dr. McTate. "We might see those things for older kids, too, but they're able to tell us how they're feeling as opposed to showing us through their behavior."</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Dr. McTate says some milestone regression is common for toddler-aged children, but it can still be distressing. "Potty training, for example, is a huge accomplishment and develops confidence in children, but it's common for kids to become incontinent during cancer treatment because they're getting tons of fluids to flush out chemotherapy. All of a sudden, they're back in a diaper. That's really hard when you're 3 years old, and you're so proud of yourself."</p>



<p>If your child is older, they might struggle with needing to be more dependent on you than is typical and missing out on time with peers or activities they enjoy. As they become more aware of their bodies, they also may start to feel insecure about the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/caregiver-support/parents#cope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical changes</a>&nbsp;cancer and cancer treatment can cause.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing for your child's changing needs</h2>



<p>Partnering with a pediatric psychologist, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center/child-life-program/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">child life specialist</a>&nbsp;and/or a&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/02/meeting-the-needs-of-young-people-with-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social worker</a>&nbsp;can help you prepare for potential disruptions to your child's development before cancer treatment begins and throughout care.</p>



<p>Dr. McTate says this is an important first step after diagnosis at Mayo Clinic. "All newly diagnosed patients meet with pediatric psychologists — within the first month or so — and we do a broad assessment and provide a lot of guidance. We want to know where your kiddo is in terms of development and get an understanding of their temperament."</p>



<p>Part of pediatric psychological care involves educating parents about providing developmentally appropriate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/caregiver-support/parents#talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">information to children</a>. "The more information kids have, the better they can cope with unpredictability and uncertainty — even if that information is really hard to hear," says Dr. McTate. "We want kids to trust that their doctors and parents are being honest with them about what is going to happen. That includes being honest about the fact that there are some things we don't know."</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>"The more information kids have, the better they can cope with unpredictability and uncertainty — even if that information is really hard to hear."  <em>EMILY MCTATE, PH.D.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>As your child's main support system, you might need extra help to cope with this difficult time, so it's important to&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/11/07/finding-balance-tips-for-managing-caregiving-and-self-care/">plan for your needs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2021/11/17/what-to-expect-when-caring-for-someone-with-cancer/">know what to expect as a caregiver</a>.</p>



<p>"Caregiver support is really important, and it looks different for every family," says Dr. McTate. "Some caregivers might have preexisting challenges with anxiety or mood that can worsen because of this huge life event. Some caregivers who haven't had concerns prior to this suddenly have challenges. In the context of a cancer diagnosis, the expected thing for a human brain to do is not feel normal."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recreating normalcy during treatment</h2>



<p>Not only are routines developmentally important for children, Dr. McTate says maintaining&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lls.org/support-resources/caregiver-support/when-your-child-has-cancer#:~:text=Children%20crave%20structure%20in%20their,she%20is%20doing%20difficult%20things." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consistency and structure</a>&nbsp;during cancer treatment can create a sense of normalcy and help your child cope. This includes maintaining regular expectations and discipline. "It's not going to look 'normal.' But I always teach families that we need some expectations and demands because we don't want kids to completely miss out on that skill building," she says.</p>



<p>Social interactions with peers are a key part of development for children and adolescents, but missing day care or school and limited time around siblings can reduce the opportunities for children to experience these connections.</p>



<p>If your child is school-aged or older, it's important they maintain connections with peers and friends as this can ease their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/survivorship/children-with-cancer/after-treatment/getting-back-to-normal.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transition back to daily life</a>. "Sometimes we see kids develop amazing skills at talking to adults because they're so used to interfacing with nurses and their medical team, but they struggle to interact with kids their age," says Dr. McTate.</p>



<p>If your child is immunocompromised, allowing them in-person opportunities to connect might be more challenging. "We try to safely get kids access to social interaction and help them maintain connections," says Dr. McTate. If your care team agrees it is safe and your child feels well enough, depending on your child's age, they may be able to text, use social media, connect with friends through video calls or invite visitors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Helping your child cope with difficult emotions</h2>



<p>Children of all ages can experience difficult emotions as they navigate cancer, but the types of emotions and reasons behind them vary by age. "It's normal to see changes in behavior, changes in mood — those things are expected," says Dr. McTate. "What we find is that when folks engage in what we call active coping, they do much better."</p>



<p>If your child is older, helping them actively cope can mean giving them space to speak freely about how they feel, encouraging them to speak to a healthcare professional, family member or friend, and teaching them to reduce stress and anxiety.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a>, a kind of talk therapy, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/biofeedback/about/pac-20384664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biofeedback</a>, a mind-body technique used to regulate stress and anxiety, are often used by cancer care teams to help children with cancer cope with fears, anxiety and other difficult emotions.</p>



<p>Explaining procedures and preparing children for possible pain also can help younger children cope with fear during treatment. This can involve working with their healthcare team to familiarize them with equipment and how it will be used to help them.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>It's normal to be concerned about your child's emotional well-being and development after a cancer diagnosis. Dr. McTate emphasizes that while it's important to be vigilant, behavior changes, milestone regression and other concerns may be temporary challenges rather than long-term barriers. "For the most part, kids will jump back on that developmental trajectory."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Silenced by cancer</h2>



<p>For the past decade, Marty battled a rare form of laryngeal cancer called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/what-is-laryngeal-chondrosarcoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chondrosarcoma</a>.</p>



<p>"I had dozens of surgeries and treatments that, over the years, took a toll on my larynx. After the last surgery, I woke up and my voice was gone," says Marty.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-role-of-the-larynx-and-how-to-protect-it/">larynx</a>, also known as the voice box, is located in the throat. Its main functions are helping people to speak, swallow and breathe.</p>



<p>"I had to get a tracheostomy tube implanted to help me breathe, and since then, my quality of life went downhill. People would look at me like I was strange," says Marty. "I got to the point I just didn't want to leave the house anymore."</p>



<p>Determined to find a way to get her husband's voice back, Marty's wife Gina scoured the internet for solutions. Her search led her to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-20055443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. David Lott</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Larynx and Trachea Transplant Program</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Lott and his team were conducting the first clinical trial in the U.S. on laryngeal transplantation. "I applied as a candidate for the program and got accepted. They told me it wouldn't be easy, but I was not going to give up," says Marty.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The groundbreaking larynx transplant</h2>



<p>A team of multidisciplinary doctors, including six surgeons, performed the 21-hour transplant on Feb. 29. The first step was to remove Marty's larynx.</p>



<p>"Our first priority was to remove the cancer," explains Dr. Lott. "When we were confident the cancer was gone, we then focused on transplanting the donor larynx."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="577" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Team-in-surgery-3_16x9-1024x577.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390222" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Team-in-surgery-3_16x9-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Team-in-surgery-3_16x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Team-in-surgery-3_16x9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Team-in-surgery-3_16x9-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Team-in-surgery-3_16x9-2048x1153.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Laryngeal transplantation is a rare procedure that has been performed only a handful of times in the world. Marty's case was the third total larynx transplant in the U.S., and the first known case performed as part of a clinical trial. Dr. Lott hopes the clinical trial will allow his team to scientifically investigate the procedure to prove it is a safe and effective option for patients.</p>



<p>The Mayo transplant is also the first known case in the world of a larynx transplant performed on a patient with an active cancer. Doctors were able to proceed with the transplant because Marty was already on immunosuppressive therapy from a previous kidney transplant.</p>



<p>"Having a patient with an active cancer who already had his own immune suppression allowed us to do the transplant safely without introducing additional risk in a way that has rarely, if ever, been done before," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Girish Mour,&nbsp;M.B.B.S., </a>medical director of the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently there are tens of thousands of people worldwide who are living without a voice box, mostly due to trauma or cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated there will be 12,650 new cases of laryngeal cancer in 2024. Dr. Lott says many of those patients will be among the highest at risk of losing their larynx.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Breaking the silence</h2>



<p>In just over four months after his surgery, Marty had regained full ability to swallow foods, was making progress learning to breathe on his own again and speaking with his voice at 60%.</p>



<p>"I was able to talk to my 82-year-old mother on the phone," says Marty. She could hear me and understood every word I said. It is amazing."</p>



<p>"It is remarkable," says Dr. Lott. "Marty has exceeded all of our expectations. I didn't expect him to be eating a hamburger this soon after a larynx transplant, if ever. It is truly amazing."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/FTsi0phjWDo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Welcome home Marty</strong></a></h3>

</div></figure>



<p>Marty and Gina celebrated the successful transplant with an extended road trip on their way home. "We wanted to take a moment and appreciate where this journey has led us and where we are today," says Marty.</p>



<p>The couple had already made a visit to the Grand Canyon. After leaving Phoenix, they stopped in San Diego to see the Pacific Ocean, visited the Golden Gate Bridge, and got a glimpse of Mount Rushmore and Niagara Falls.</p>

<p>"It feels so amazing to be able to talk to anyone I meet on the street," says Marty. I will be forever grateful to Dr. Lott and Mayo for giving me my life back. I am also deeply grateful for the generosity of my organ donor and the donor family. They are the true heroes of this story."</p>



<p>When the couple arrived home in Haverhill, they were greeted by a cheering crowd of family, friends and reporters all eager to hear his voice.</p>

<p>"I will share my story with anyone who wants to hear it," says Marty. "My job right now is to heal up and get my voice back 100%. My next job will be to reach out to as many people as I can and let them know they can do it too."</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank">Breast cancer</a>&nbsp;is the most diagnosed cancer in U.S. women with about 1 in 8 women diagnosed over the course of their lifetime. In about 35% of cases, a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670" target="_blank">mastectomy</a>&nbsp;is part of a woman's treatment plan and involves removing all tissue in one or both breasts, sometimes including the nipples and areolas. While it is considered a lifesaving procedure for women with breast cancer, it can take an emotional toll that can lead to a distorted self-image.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/breast-cancer-reconstruction-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breast reconstruction</a> is a series of optional procedures that uses a woman's tissue or implants to restore the appearance of natural breasts and help improve confidence and self-image after cancer.</p>



<p>A few months after reconstruction surgery is complete, women can decide to restore the appearance of their missing nipples and areolas with a nipple reconstruction procedure or 3D tattoos. During a nipple reconstruction procedure, a surgeon uses skin from the breast to rebuild the nipple, whereas a 3D tattoo adds color to the nipple and areola areas. A woman can select one, both or neither of these elective procedures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find out what you need to know about 3D tattoos in this Q&amp;A.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is a 3D tattoo?</h3>



<p>A 3D tattoo uses pigments to replicate the areola on a woman's reconstructed breast. It uses light and dark pigments to create a 3D illusion and make it appear that the woman has an areola and nipple after they have been removed during surgery. The pigments are color-matched to each patient, and the goal is to restore the breast's natural appearance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Are 3D tattoos painful?</h3>



<p>No, unlike a traditional tattoo, 3D tattooing is a comfortable, nearly pain-free procedure because the breasts lose sensation after a mastectomy. Aftercare and recovery are similar to a conventional tattoo, including light coverage with gauze for a few days, cleansing with antibacterial soap and applying fragrance-free, gentle lotion until the site heals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How many sessions are required?</h3>



<p>Most women complete the procedure in the clinic over two visits. The initial visit takes two hours. During that' time, the woman works with the healthcare professional to select pigments and determine the position of the areolas. Then the tattooing is performed. The second visit is six to eight weeks later for pigment touch-up and evaluation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are the benefits of 3D tattoos?</h3>



<p>Some women have said that their breasts appear incomplete without nipples or areolas, similar to a face without a nose. Tattooed areolas and nipples can help women focus less on what is missing and eliminate the constant visual reminder of their cancer journeys.</p>



<p>Many women also have reported that it improves intimacy with their partners because it helps partners feel more comfortable with their new breasts. Also, it distracts from any scarring and leads the eye to a new focal point rather than just the scars across the breasts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How soon after reconstruction can I get a 3D tattoo?</h3>



<p>A woman must have completed all her reconstruction surgeries and cancer treatments before getting a 3D tattoo. Typically, three months after reconstruction is enough time to ensure that all incisions have healed correctly and for the new breast tissue or implants to settle into their natural positions.</p>



<p>3D tattoos are not only for women with a recent cancer journey. The procedure also is available for women who have had mastectomy surgeries years ― or even decades ― ago when 3D tattooing wasn't available.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Does insurance cover the cost of 3D tattoos?</h3>



<p>Typically, 3D tattoos are covered by private insurance, but women are encouraged to check with their healthcare insurance providers regarding coverage. A private pay option also is available.</p>



<p>Some people get a traditional tattoo to mark a milestone or celebrate a moment. A 3D nipple and areola tattooing are no different. For many women, a 3D tattoo is the milestone step in their cancer journeys.</p>

<p>"These results are encouraging and establish a new standard of treatment for people with BCP-ALL," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/litzow-mark-r-m-d/bio-20053695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Litzow, M.D.</a>, lead study author and hematologist at the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "The addition of blinatumomab to chemotherapy reduced the risk of leukemia recurrence and death by nearly 60%."</p>



<p>Blinatumomab is a type of immunotherapy administered intravenously and brings a normal immune cell called a T cell close to a leukemia cell so it can destroy it. The Food and Drug Administration approved blinatumomab for patients in remission who have traces of cancer, also known as measurable residual disease (MRD)-positive. In this study, blinatumomab was added to see if it could lessen the risk of the ALL coming back and relapsing in a person who had no detection of cancer, also known as MRD-negative, following initial chemotherapy.</p>



<p>The study enrolled 488 participants aged 30 to 70 years with BCP-ALL, and 224 of them were in remission and MRD-negative following the initial course of treatment with chemotherapy. The 224 participants were equally randomized into two arms; the first arm would receive blinatumomab with chemotherapy, and the second arm would receive the standard treatment of chemotherapy alone.</p>



<p>The results showed that 85% of participants treated with blinatumomab and chemotherapy were alive at three years, compared to 68% of those who received chemotherapy alone, which is the standard treatment.</p>



<p>"We plan to build on this study to reduce the amount of chemotherapy people need to receive, ultimately leading to fewer side effects from the treatment and improving overall survival rates," Dr. Litzow says.</p>



<p>This study was conducted by the <a href="https://ecog-acrin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group</a> and funded in part by the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a> of the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>. See the full paper for the complete list of funding and authors.</p>

<p>Pancreatic cancer is a formidable disease, often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. However, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38703880/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new research from Mayo Clinic</a> represents a promising step toward identifying biological signals or biomarkers that may aid in early detection.</p>



<p>By tracking changes in body composition and metabolism, researchers are working to identify high-risk patients who could benefit from selective screening for the disease, which kills more than 50,000 Americans a year.</p>

<p>"When most patients come to us with pancreatic cancer, their cancer has already spread and their survival over a five-year period is only three percent. But if we catch them early, at stage 1A, their five-year survival rate can be as high as 80%," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/bi-yan-m-d-ph-d/bio-20530397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yan Bi, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "Detecting the cancer earlier is the best way to improve survival."</p>



<p>Early detection is tricky because the first symptoms of pancreatic cancer — digestive issues, belly pain and weight loss — are not specific. "Weight loss occurs even before the diagnosis," says Dr. Bi. "A majority of pancreatic cancer patients will lose weight before they discover they have cancer."</p>



<p>Studies have shown that as the disease progresses, cancer cells promote a wide range of metabolic and physiologic changes. Dr. Bi and her colleagues wondered if these changes could serve as biomarkers, to enable healthcare providers to detect pancreatic cancer earlier than ever before.</p>



<p>Dr. Bi teamed up with Derk Klatte, M.D., Ph.D., and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wallace-michael-b-m-d/bio-00092410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Wallace, M.D.</a>, to examine medical records of patients with a common type of pancreatic cancer known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who had been diagnosed at Mayo Clinic between 2002 and 2021. They analyzed abdominal CT scans and blood tests taken up to three years before the patients were diagnosed. Using advanced algorithms developed by data scientist Alex Weston, Ph.D., the researchers measured changes in body fat, muscle and bone, as well as shifts in blood-based biomarkers like cholesterol and glucose levels.</p>



<p>The findings, published in the journal <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38703880/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a>, revealed changes in a variety of physiological and metabolic measurements. The researchers observed significant reductions in both fat surrounding the organs (visceral fat) and the fat under the skin (subcutaneous fat) as patients approached their diagnosis date. In addition, patients exhibited a notable drop in serum lipids — fats found in the blood — such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol and triglycerides.</p>



<p>Conversely, the study found that blood glucose levels increased up to three years before patients were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, confirming a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29775599/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link previously described</a> by Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist Suresh Chari, M.D. Additional findings revealed that patients also experienced a loss of muscle mass and bone volume, which became more pronounced in the last six months before their cancer was detected.</p>



<p>"It is a bizarre condition," says Dr. Bi. "Patients' bodies are changing — they are losing weight and their total cholesterol levels are going down…many things you think would be healthy, but in this case, they're not. Nobody knows exactly what is going on, but we aim to find out."</p>



<p>Dr. Bi recently received two grants, one from the National Institutes of Health and another from the Department of Defense, to investigate how the growth of pancreatic tumors could drive such widespread metabolic changes.</p>



<p>She is also expanding her work on pancreatic cancer biomarkers, searching for the best combination of factors to make an early diagnosis. "We are using many different layers of information — medical records, labs and data gathered from wearable devices," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Bi is part of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/education-training/kern-health-care-delivery-scholars-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kern Health Care Delivery Scholars Program</a> in the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/education-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert D. and Patricia E.&nbsp;Kern&nbsp;Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a>. The program supports the next generation of clinically trained, doctoral-level fellows and junior faculty in health services research.</p>



<p>As a Kern Health Care Delivery Scholar, Dr. Bi has been working on a project that uses wearables like Apple Watches or Fitbits to track changes in body composition as well as the power of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>



<p>"My goal is to combine that information with all the other data we have on a patient and use AI to calculate their risk of developing pancreatic cancer in three years," she says. "If they are at increased risk, we could start doing surveillance with abdominal imaging."</p>



<p>The team's early findings suggest that capturing the subtle yet significant body changes that occur as pancreatic cancer develops could be a key strategy in the fight against the disease. Recognizing these changes early could lead to timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially saving lives.</p>



<p>Dr. Bi and her colleagues at Mayo Clinic are active in the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38626807/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pancreatic Cancer Early Detection (PRECEDE) consortium</a>, a global effort to improve early detection and prevention of pancreatic cancer. The consortium's goal is to increase the five-year survival rate to 50% after 10 years.</p>



<p>"It is very ambitious," she says, "but I hope we can reach that goal by pushing for early detection."</p>

The vaccine aims to prevent breast cancer tumors from returning, as relapsing cancer is often more aggressive and difficult to treat. The latest research also seeks to understand why some breast cancer tumors evade the body's immune response.</p>



<p>Featured experts are <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/knutson-keith-l-ph-d/bio-00026672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Keith Knutson</a>, an immunologist and cancer vaccine researcher at Mayo Clinic; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chumsri-saranya-m-d/bio-20114242?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=yext&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=departmentcancer&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=cancer&amp;cauid=105142&amp;y_source=1_OTE2NDc2NDktNDgzLWxvY2F0aW9uLndlYnNpdGU%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Saranya Chumsri</a>, a Mayo Clinic hematologist​; and <a href="https://hemonc.uw.edu/people/nora-disis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nora Disis,</a> director of the University of Washington Institute of Translational Health Science and the Center for Translational Medicine in Women’s Health at University of Washington.</p>



<p>Vaccines help to protect people from deadly viruses, but can they also help fight cancer? Vaccine trials are underway to target aggressive cancers such as triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancers. These types of cancers have a high reoccurrence rate.</p>

<p>"I think the tricky part is trying to activate our immune system to be able to recognize that particular cancer. It's different in different types of cancer," says Dr. Chumsri. "I think in breast cancer, it might be difficult for the immune system to generate <a>the</a> effective immune response, but that's what we all try to work for."</p>



<p>"We have a number of different approaches that we're using. So, for example, we have peptide vaccines that are administered with this danger signal so that we can alert the immune system to respond," explains Dr. Knutson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts say, in the future, vaccines would target cancer risk factors, such as inflammation.</p>



<p>"We're actively working on vaccines targeting cancer risk factors like chronic inflammation," says Dr. Disis. "So this would potentially be able to reduce their risk of development of cancer by controlling that chronic inflammation."</p>
