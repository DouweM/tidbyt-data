<p>During breaks from his doctoral research in London, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vile-richard-g-ph-d/bio-00027663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</a>, would visit a pediatric brain tumor clinic next to his lab for inspiration. Seeing children suffer changed the course of his career, igniting his passion for finding <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> treatments that would be easier for people to tolerate.</p>



<p>"I became very, very motivated to try and apply the science I learned to make cancer treatments gentler," says Dr. Vile. "My goal was to deliver an option that would extend and improve quality of life."</p>



<p>Decades later, Dr. Vile is leading research into genetically engineered viruses aimed at unleashing a two-pronged attack on cancer. One part of this technology, known as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/oncolytic-virus-optimizes-car-t-cell-therapy-for-solid-tumors/mac-20537878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oncolytic virus</a>, is designed to infect, break open and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. Dr. Vile's <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn2231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preclinical studies</a> have shown that oncolytic viruses replicated in cancer cells and cascaded to kill other diseased cells. That, in turn, triggered an immune response in which the patient’s own T cells, stimulated by the virus, recognized and targeted metastasized tumors for a second wave of cancer destruction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005.jpg" alt="Richard Vile, Ph.D." class="wp-image-377676" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005.jpg 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"Oncolytic viruses are a way to alert the immune system and mobilize it to kill cells infected with cancer," says Dr. Vile. "There's the direct killing of cancer cells with the virus, and then there's the major effect of immune activation. The immune system is incredibly well evolved to recognize infection, clear infection and kill all the cells around it that could be harboring infection."</p>



<p>In groundbreaking research, Dr. Vile's team is combining oncolytic viruses with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy</a>) to target solid tumors from liver cancer. This experimental approach of loading CAR-T cells with oncolytic virus is a new way to expand CAR-T cell therapy beyond treatment for blood cancers into treatment for solid tumors.</p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy is a regenerative immunotherapy in which a patient's T-cells are genetically modified to recognize and stop cancer. It has shown great promise by putting some B-cell lymphomas and leukemias into remission. CAR-T cells are highly targeted to tumor cells, with the goal of having fewer side effects than cancer treatments that also kill nearby healthy tissue.</p>



<p>"Loading the oncolytic virus onto CAR-T cells may give us three levels of killing. First, the CAR-T cells target the tumor and kill some of the cells," says Dr. Vile. "Next, it delivers the oncolytic virus, which infects tumor cells, replicates and kills them. Third, that alerts the immune system of the patient to the fact that there's something majorly wrong. The immune system starts to see the cancer and starts to react against it and kill it."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;supports Dr. Vile's research as part of its objective of delivering new cell therapies to people with complex disorders such as cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing the challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Oncolytic viruses are advancing from the lab to first-in-human clinical trials. Dr. Vile is working with the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics to biomanufacture oncolytic viruses onsite in Mayo Clinic's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) facilities. CGMP facilities are sterile rooms that help ensure that the therapy meets the identity, strength, quality and purity standards that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires for testing new therapeutics.</p>



<p>On-site biomanufacturing could lower production costs, allow for more individualized treatment and deliver the treatment to patients sooner than might be possible with an outside manufacturer.</p>



<p>"We are completing our studies in the lab and are transitioning to safety studies in the patient," explained Dr. Vile. "At the same time, we will manufacture the virus at a level of cleanliness (sterility) to meet FDA standards."</p>



<p>Oncolytic virus therapy is evolving, with more research needed to validate its safety and effectiveness. Dr. Vile hopes to test oncolytic viruses with CAR-T cell therapy for liver cancer in a phase 1 clinical trial in the next year or two.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heartburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20373223?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heartburn</a> — it's the cardinal symptom of GERD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease, is when you get acid and chemical damage to the lining of the esophagus," says Dr. East.</p>



<p>You might feel a lump in the throat, have difficulty swallowing, have chest pain, a cough, or have worsening <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/is-there-a-connection-between-asthma-and-acid-reflux/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asthma-type</a> symptoms.</p>



<p>"Complications of GERD include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophagitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20361224?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esophagitis</a>, inflammation in the bottom of the esophagus," says Dr. East. "If this is persistent, you can develop scarring and a stricture."</p>



<p>But if it's persistent and heals, the lining of the esophagus can change to a more acid-resistant form, which is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/barretts-esophagus/symptoms-causes/syc-20352841?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barrett's esophagus</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It affects 10% to 15% of people with GERD. And a much smaller group faces another risk, says Dr. East.</p>



<p>"About 1 in 200 patients with Barrett's esophagus per year will develop <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356084?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esophageal adenocarcinoma.</a>"</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> A 62-year-old man I worked with was diagnosed with stomach cancer earlier this year. He reportedly was feeling full even after eating small meals and experienced stomach pain above his belly button. I am starting to worry because I have recently started to experience similar symptoms. I’m only 38. Is it possible I could have stomach cancer? How do I get screened? What are the treatment options?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Most people diagnosed with<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopy/about/pac-20395197?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">stomach cancer</a>, which is also called gastric cancer,&nbsp;are over the age of 60. However,&nbsp;in the U.S., stomach cancers&nbsp;in people under 40 have been steadily rising. Overall, this form of cancer is not very common, but factors that increase your risk include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eating smoked, salted, processed or charcoaled meats, and pickled vegetables.</li>



<li>Eating few or no fruits and vegetables.</li>



<li>Alcohol use.</li>



<li>Previous stomach surgery.</li>



<li>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.</li>



<li>Inherited cancer syndromes such as: hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), familial adenomatous polyposis, gastric adenoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.</li>
</ul>



<p>Unfortunately, stomach cancer doesn’t always cause symptoms in its early stages, and many symptoms may not happen until the cancer is advanced. Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Difficulty swallowing.</li>



<li>Belly pain.</li>



<li>Feeling bloated after eating.</li>



<li>Feeling full after eating small amounts of food.</li>



<li>Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry.</li>



<li>Losing weight without trying.</li>



<li>Feeling very tired.</li>



<li>Stools that look black.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you have signs and symptoms that worry you, you should make an appointment with your healthcare team. Many other conditions can cause symptoms that are similar to stomach cancer. Your healthcare team may recommend testing such as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopy/about/pac-20395197?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">upper endoscopy</a>, also called an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which is a procedure that is used to visually examine your upper digestive system. This can be used to screen for stomach cancer as the cause of your symptoms. An EGD allows the doctor to look at the inside of your stomach. Stomach cancer can appear as an ulcer, a mass or a thickening of the stomach wall. Your physician then can obtain biopsies of the area to determine if you have stomach cancer.</p>



<p>The treatment of stomach cancer depends on the stage. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopic-ultrasound/about/pac-20385171?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Endoscopic ultrasound</a>, a minimally invasive procedure to assess diseases of the digestive (gastrointestinal) tract and other nearby organs and tissues, CT or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pet-scan/about/pac-20385078?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">PET scan imaging</a>, and a staging laparoscopy are used to determine the clinical stage.</p>



<p>While it is uncommon to find early stomach cancer, treatment for early-stage disease often only requires local treatment. For example, in early stomach cancers that involve only the mucosa, or inner lining of the stomach, and measure less than 2-3 centimeters in size, the stomach cancer can be removed using endoscopic submucosal dissection without the need for surgery or additional treatment. For other early stomach cancers that do not meet these criteria, surgery to remove the stomach cancer and regional lymph nodes is recommended.</p>



<p>However, if the cancer is found to have spread to the lymph nodes at the time of surgery, then the patient is at a higher risk of stomach cancer returning after surgery alone. Therefore, chemotherapy after surgery is often recommended to decrease the risk of cancer recurrence.</p>



<p>Typically, patients are diagnosed with more advanced stomach cancer, which means a deeper involvement of the stomach or spread to regional lymph nodes. In this more common situation, combining chemotherapy and surgery is necessary for the best outcomes. Chemotherapy usually is given before and after surgery in this case.</p>



<p>Finally, if the stomach cancer has been found to have spread outside the stomach and regional lymph nodes, then this is stage 4 cancer. The primary treatment is systemic therapy. Additional testing can be done on the tumor to determine if the stomach cancer might respond to targeted therapy or immunotherapy. In some cases where there is a small amount of tumor spread to the lining of the abdomen, also called the peritoneum, surgery called cytoreductive surgery and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/more-adventures-thanks-to-advanced-cancer-care-robotic-surgery/">hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;can be used to prolong a patient’s survival.</p>



<p>Treatment options to treat stomach cancer are complex and should be individualized to your particular situation. It is essential to seek out an experienced team to help with the accurate staging of cancer, help with management decisions and for high-quality endoscopic or surgical resection.<em> —&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grotz-travis-e-m-d/bio-20342285"><strong><em>Dr. Travis Grotz</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Surgical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>A recent Mayo Clinic retrospective&nbsp;<a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.23.00118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;shows that cancer practices can integrate telehealth without duplicative care, allowing for a more streamlined healthcare experience for patients and their caregivers.</p>



<p>Researchers analyzed trends in telehealth use from 2019 to 2021 across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/3-sites-1-comprehensive-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. The study looked at hematology and oncology visits conducted across Mayo Clinic campuses in Minnesota, Florida and Arizona, as well as at community-based clinics across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a>.</p>



<p>In 2019, telehealth visits accounted for fewer than 0.01% of all visits. In 2020, a significant rise in telehealth use occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the portion of visits conducted via telehealth increasing to 11%. By 2021, that figure rose to 14%, demonstrating a continued turn toward telehealth beyond the immediate pandemic response.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Pritchett_Joshua_C._16081960_20230925-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378074" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Pritchett_Joshua_C._16081960_20230925-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Pritchett_Joshua_C._16081960_20230925.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joshua C. Pritchett, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We're showing that not only did our providers continue to use telehealth after the initial surge, but adoption (of the technology) increased over time and did not lead to increases in per-patient or per-provider care volumes," says lead author of the study, Joshua C. Pritchett, M.D., a hematology and oncology fellow at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Overall, researchers examined over 100,000 visits conducted from 2019 to 2021, representing one of the largest analyses of telehealth use trends among cancer patients to date. Among people receiving established, ongoing care during the study, it found that 39.4% took part in at least one telehealth visit, demonstrating the critical role telehealth has played in the care of patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Researchers note that the study demonstrates that patient satisfaction ratings for telehealth visits remained similar to satisfaction with in-person care.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital health tools provide in-between visit care for patients</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Haddad_Tufia_C._10120386_20220907-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378073" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Haddad_Tufia_C._10120386_20220907-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Haddad_Tufia_C._10120386_20220907.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tufia C. Haddad, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Beyond telehealth, the Mayo Clinic remote patient monitoring program is continuing to expand into the cancer space, allowing us to provide tablets and wearable devices for improved monitoring and in-between visit care," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/haddad-tufia-c-m-d/bio-20055534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tufia C. Haddad, M.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist and the study's senior author. "This will continue to help us understand how our patients are doing, how their symptoms and vital signs are tracking so that we can intervene earlier when things are not trending in a favorable direction."</p>



<p>With the many challenges of needing to get to and from appointments, telehealth has proved to be a worthy resource for many patients and their caregivers. The study showed that 52% of all visits by people undergoing treatment for various forms of brain cancer were conducted by video or phone technologies, demonstrating how access to care from home can be invaluable for many.</p>



<p>"The home is where healthcare happens," says Dr. Haddad. "Increasingly, we are seeing a continued shift in care to the home environment where smart homes enabled by digital technologies help assess and monitor patients. In the future, I think that will be more commonplace, and from there, we will only see the continued growth of virtual care delivery."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reimbursement structures may affect the future of telehealth growth</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers noted that 20% of the U.S. population lives and works in rural areas; however, only 3% of oncology practices provide care there. For those in rural areas finding it difficult to travel for cancer care, telehealth has proven to be a lifeline when available.</p>



<p>The study showed a significantly higher rate of phone visits in rural populations versus video visits. Dr. Pritchett says the increased use of telehealth through phone visits is encouraging and shows a willingness by rural patients with cancer to engage with telehealth overall.</p>



<p>However, he notes that with the end of the Public Health Emergency Declaration applied in response to COVID-19, there has been a decline in reimbursement for phone visits compared to video visits. This change has the potential to create a widening disparity between urban, suburban and rural residents, and shows a need for future studies to examine how to increase video visit use among rural populations, he says.</p>



<p>"Telehealth in cancer care isn't simply a byproduct of the pandemic response. Patients desire this type of care, and it has become an integral part of patient-centered cancer care that continues to evolve," says Dr. Pritchett. "I think a big takeaway from this work is going to be how we make sure that it continues to be equitable and accessible to patients, as well as sustainable for practices."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thanksgiving Day is also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/famhistory/knowing_not_enough.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ffeatures%2Ffamilyhealthhistory%2Findex.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Health History Day</a>, an annual national campaign to promote awareness of hereditary health traits in families.</strong></h3>



<p>Has your grandmother, mother, aunt or sister had breast or ovarian cancer? Has your grandfather, father or uncle had prostate, breast or pancreatic cancer? Is there a history in your family of colon cancer, diabetes or high cholesterol?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If any of these scenarios resonate within your family, you could also be at risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many hereditary health conditions follow patterns within families, with sometimes as high as a 50% likelihood that if one parent possesses a mutated gene, their child will inherit it. Recent Mayo Clinic&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-finds-1-in-8-patients-with-cancer-harbor-inherited-genetic-mutations/">research</a>&nbsp;shows that inherited, faulty genes cause more than 10% of all cancers.</p>



<p>"The biggest advice I would give is that if you are with your family this Thanksgiving, spend a few moments to share some of that family health history information. And if a red flag goes up, report that to your doctor. It could actually save someone's life," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/presutti-richard-john-j-d-o/bio-20053922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Presutti, D.O.</a>, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician and a researcher at the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Predictive power of genomics</strong></h3>



<p>Dr. Presutti has integrated genomics into his everyday medical decision-making for his patients, realizing the potential for improving health outcomes.</p>



<p>"If I can help identify patients at high risk for cancer and other diseases, then I can help get them started on screening earlier and avoid the situation of metastatic cancer and early cancer deaths," he says.</p>



<p>Equally important to the discovery of a person's inherited cancer mutation is the potential for them to share the heritable cause of their disease with their blood relatives, allowing family members to pursue care for earlier disease detection and cancer management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The power of genetics is that we can potentially foresee the cancer that will develop in other family members," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/samadder-niloy-jewel-jewel-j-m-d/bio-20396993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niloy Jewel Samadder, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and cancer geneticist. "This can allow us to target cancer screening to those high-risk individuals and hopefully prevent cancer altogether in the next generation of the family."</p>



<p>Dr. Samadder emphasizes that knowing your family health history can help you, but only if you act on it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Questions to ask family about health history</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Do you have chronic conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol?</li>



<li>Have you had serious diseases, such as cancer or stroke?</li>



<li>How old were you when each of these diseases or health conditions was diagnosed?</li>



<li>What is your family's ancestry? What countries or regions did your ancestors come from?</li>



<li>What were the causes and ages of death for relatives who have died?</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Examples of family health syndromes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome</a>&nbsp;is an inherited mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Along with breast and ovarian cancer, this syndrome also can lead to male breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>&nbsp;is a cluster of mutations that can boost the risk of a wide range of cancers, including colon, rectal, endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, kidney, brain, uterus and bile duct.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/familial-hypercholesterolemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Familial hypercholesterolemia</a>&nbsp;is a genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol, which can lead to premature cardiovascular disease.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Health history situations that raise a red flag</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>A person developed cancer at an unusually young age.</li>



<li>A person has had several different types of cancer.</li>



<li>Cancer developed in both organs in a set of paired organs, such as both kidneys or both breasts.</li>



<li>Several first-degree relatives ― parents, siblings or a person's children ― have the same type of cancer. Examples might include a mother, daughter and sisters with breast cancer; multiple family members with breast or ovarian cancer; or family members with colon cancer and endometrial cancer.</li>



<li>Unusual cases of a specific cancer type, such as breast cancer in a man.</li>



<li>Being a member of a racial or ethnic group that is known to have an increased risk of having a certain inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome.</li>



<li>Several family members with cancer.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What to do with the information</strong></h3>



<p>If you have a family health history of disease, here are some steps to take:</p>



<ul>
<li>Consult a healthcare professional: Schedule a consultation with a doctor or genetic counselor to discuss your family health history and any potential risks.</li>



<li>Genetic testing: In some cases, your healthcare team may recommend genetic testing to determine whether you have specific genetic mutations or markers associated with hereditary diseases.</li>



<li>Lifestyle modifications: Make lifestyle changes to reduce risk factors, such as maintaining a healthy diet, staying physically active, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption.</li>



<li>Communicate: Keep open lines of communication with family members about their health histories, as it can provide valuable insights for everyone's well-being.</li>
</ul>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic researchers demonstrated a nearly 20% increase in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a> vaccination rates among adolescents through a combination intervention approach, a new Mayo Clinic study finds. The strategy involved mailing reminders to parents about their child's eligibility for the HPV vaccine and simultaneously giving healthcare providers feedback about successful HPV vaccine administration among the patients they had recently seen.</p>



<p>The findings, published in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2812161">JAMA Pediatrics</a>, suggest healthcare practices could adopt this evidence-based approach to boost HPV vaccination uptake in 11- and 12-year-olds.</p>



<p>"HPV vaccine uptake at 60% of eligible adolescents falls short of national public health goals and lags other adolescent vaccines," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/jacobson-robert-m-m-d/bio-00083020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Jacobson, M.D.</a>, a pediatrician in the Mayo Clinic Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. Dr. Jacobson is a co-principal investigator of the study.</p>



<p>Human papillomaviruses cause viral infections transmitted sexually through skin-to-skin contact. HPV infections may occur without symptoms or signs in late adolescence or early adulthood and affect both males and females. The virus can cause several types of cancers, including of the cervix, anus, genital area, mouth and throat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cases.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimates</a> 37,000 HPV-linked cancers occur each year in the U.S., all of which may be prevented by the HPV vaccination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the study, the researchers evaluated their intervention strategy at six Mayo Clinic primary care practices in Southeastern Minnesota. The investigation involved 9,242 adolescents who were due to receive at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. When parents received reminders in the mail and providers were simultaneously given feedback, 39.7% of patients got their doses due in the months that followed the interventions, as contrasted to 21.9% without the interventions.</p>



<p>“Our study investigated both parent- and provider-facing interventions. By targeting parents and providers, we achieved much higher improvements in HPV vaccine uptake than the use of these strategies in isolation,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rutten-lila-j-ph-d/bio-20551780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lila Finney Rutten, Ph.D.</a>, lead author and chair of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/quantitative-health-sciences/divisions/epidemiology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Division of Epidemiology</a>.</p>



<p>The researchers say the study not only addresses the low HPV vaccination rate but also holds the potential to reshape other public health and vaccination campaigns.</p>

<p>November is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aacr.org/patients-caregivers/awareness-months/pancreatic-cancer-awareness-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month</a>, which makes this a good time to learn more about the risk factors for pancreatic cancer and what you can do to keep yourself safe.</p>



<p>More than 64,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year, and more than 50,000 people will die of the disease, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. Pancreatic cancer is the&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org/?_ga=2.189398057.347593919.1602700843-1875348864.1599565997&amp;_gac=1.45345424.1602700843.EAIaIQobChMIsIfA8N207AIVksDACh2zsQq-EAAYASAAEgItfvD_BwE#!/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-leading cause of cancer death</a>&nbsp;in the U.S.</p>

Your pancreas releases enzymes that aid digestion and produces hormones that help manage your blood sugar.</p>



<p>Several types of growths can occur in the pancreas, including cancerous and noncancerous tumors. The most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which begins in the cells that line the ducts that carry digestive enzymes out of the pancreas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Signs and symptoms of&nbsp;pancreatic cancer&nbsp;often don't occur until the disease is advanced. This means the disease rarely is detected at its early stages when it's most curable.</p>



<p>Pancreatic cancer symptoms can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Abdominal pain that radiates to your back.</li>



<li>Loss of appetite or unintended weight loss.</li>



<li>Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes.</li>



<li>Light-colored stools.</li>



<li>Dark-colored urine.</li>



<li>Itchy skin.</li>



<li>New diagnosis of diabetes or existing diabetes that's becoming more difficult to control.</li>



<li>Blood clots.</li>



<li>Fatigue.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Risk Factors</strong></h2>



<p>Factors that can increase your risk of pancreatic cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Smoking.</li>



<li>Diabetes.</li>



<li>Chronic inflammation of the pancreas, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20360227?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatitis</a>.</li>



<li>Family history of genetic syndromes that can increase cancer risk, including a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BRCA2 gene mutation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>&nbsp;and familial atypical mole malignant melanoma syndrome.</li>



<li>Family history of pancreatic cancer.</li>



<li>Obesity.</li>



<li>Older age, as most people are diagnosed after 65.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Reducing your risk</strong></h2>



<p>While some of these risk factors are out of your control, here are some lifestyle choices you can make to reduce your risk:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Stop smoking.<br></strong>If you smoke, try to stop. Talk to your healthcare team about strategies to help you stop, including support groups, medications and nicotine replacement therapy. If you don't smoke, don't start.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight.<br></strong>If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain it. If you need to lose weight, aim for a slow, steady weight loss — 1 to 2 pounds a week. Combine daily exercise with a diet rich in vegetables, fruit and whole grains, with smaller portions to help you lose weight.</li>



<li><strong>Choose a healthy diet.</strong><br>A diet full of colorful fruits and vegetables, and whole grains, may reduce your risk of cancer.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355427?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment</a> for pancreatic cancer depends on the stage and location of the cancer as well as on your overall health and personal preferences. For most people, the first goal of pancreatic cancer treatment is to eliminate the cancer, when possible. When that isn't an option, the focus may be on improving your quality of life and limiting the cancer from growing or causing more harm.</p>



<p>Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination of these. When pancreatic cancer is advanced and these treatments aren't likely to offer a benefit, your healthcare professional will focus on symptom relief with palliative care to keep you as comfortable as possible for as long as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioblastoma/cdc-20350148?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glioblastoma</a> is a fast-growing and aggressive brain tumor that begins as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord. As it grows, it can invade and destroy healthy tissue. There is no cure, but treatments may slow the cancer's growth and reduce symptoms.</p>



<p>Glioblastoma is a diverse cancer, which means that biopsies from different regions of each patient's tumor can represent widely different tumor biology. Treatments that work for one region of the tumor may not work for others.</p>



<p>MRI provides a way to look at the whole tumor but is poor at differentiating regions of unfavorable tumor progression from regions of favorable tumor response which is often mixed with immune response and inflammation. For this reason, it can be difficult for physicians to use imaging to determine if a treatment works for all or part of the patient’s tumor.</p>



<p>This new NCI grant supports a team of researchers to develop the Mathematical Oncology Systems Analysis Imaging Center (MOSAIC). MOSAIC will combine biopsies collected at different regions of each patient’s tumor with features on patient MRIs. MOSAIC researchers rely on these patterns to build mathematical and machine learning models allowing MRI to predict tumor biology in regions that were not biopsied. In this way, MOSAIC researchers can effectively create so-called "virtual biopsies" of patient’s tumors without surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mathematical oncology is the use of mathematics, modeling and simulation in cancer biology and oncology.&nbsp;This fusion of the quantitative sciences with the study of cancer includes the development of predictive mathematical models that help bridge gaps in knowledge in the understanding of cancer or data-driven machine-learning approaches that detect patterns in cancer data that had not been identified previously.</p>



<p>"This grant is important as it will help us use MRI as a lens to more directly predict changes in the biology of each patient’s tumor during treatment when we normally have very limited access to tissue samples," says the study's co-principal investigator, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/swanson-kristin-r-ph-d/bio-20396996?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristin Swanson, Ph.D.</a>, a mathematical oncologist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. &nbsp;</p>



<p>MOSAIC's image-based mathematical models will use MRI to track aspects of tumor heterogeneity previously unattainable during the course of patient care. This is particularly important as the brain is a protected organ which limits tissue sampling during rare surgical interventions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This grant will allow us to better understand which of our patients are responding to treatment and to ultimately drive new clinical trials that improve patient outcomes," adds Dr. Swanson.</p>



<p>The center will be based at Mayo Clinic in Arizona with co-principal investigator <a href="https://www.pathology.columbia.edu/profile/peter-d-canoll-md#research?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Canoll, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Columbia University, and involves collaboration among multiple institutions, including Arizona State University, Columbia University, City of Hope, Inova, Mayo Clinic Rochester, MD Anderson and Washington University.</p>



<p>The grant is supported by NCI of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under project number <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/erErGjWh7k-kKXXTUi4tag/project-details/10729420details?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1U54CA274504-01A1</a>.

<p>Screening for<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> lung cancer</a> can save lives, and there's an urgent need for more screening of people of color. That's one of the takeaways from the newly released <a href="https://www.lung.org/research/state-of-lung-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"State of Lung Cancer"</a> report from the American Lung Association.</p>



<p>"Lung cancer is the largest (cancer) killer of adult men and women worldwide. Many of the reasons for that is it's so late in its stage, often, when it's diagnosed," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/reisenauer-janani-s-m-d/bio-20433096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Janani Reisenauer</a>, a thoracic surgeon and interventional pulmonologist at Mayo Clinic. "Historical data show that 70% of lung cancers that were being diagnosed were at stage 3, which makes it much more challenging to treat and cure someone of lung cancer."</p>



<p>"Through lung cancer screening, we've been able to identify patients much earlier in their stage, which gives them more treatment options and much more hopeful chances of cure. For that reason, screening is important," she says.</p>

<p>The latest update from the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/lung-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/detection.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a> recommends that people with a substantial smoking history undergo an annual low-dose CT scan for lung cancer screening. Dr. Reisenauer says the new guidelines allow a broader population to be eligible for screening.</p>



<p>"Any patient with a significant smoking history and over age 55 (are the new guidelines). It used to be just 20 years of smoking, and now we've redefined it to say the number of cigarettes per day times the number of years smoking," she says.</p>

<p>"Even if you were smoking for only 10 years and not 20 years, but you were smoking twice as much, you might also be a candidate under the new screening guidelines for a CT," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Reisenauer recommends that eligible patients talk with their primary care team to let them know you are interested in screening.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/09/16-x-9-lung-CT.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of a CT lung cancer screening" class="wp-image-216708" style="width:800px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/09/16-x-9-lung-CT.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/09/16-x-9-lung-CT-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<p><strong>How lung cancer screening works</strong></p>



<p>Screening includes a low-dose CT scan to detect suspicious lung nodules and signs of lung cancer. Detecting lung cancer in its early stages significantly increases the likelihood of successful treatment and cure.</p>



<p>If lung cancer is confirmed, Dr. Reisenauer says a patient will work with a multidisciplinary team to decide the best treatment option.</p>



<p>She says Mayo Clinic continues to pioneer lung cancer treatment through research and innovation, working for better patient outcomes.</p>



<p>"We generate patient-specific individualized custom treatments for those patients, whether it's given IV or a surgery, or something completely novel like through the robotic bronchoscope. Our understanding of how a patient gets lung cancer and how we can treat it to where it's not the No. 1 cancer killer worldwide — I think we'll make much movement there in the next 10 to 20 years," she says.</p>



<p>"And I think screening is a part of that so we can capture these patients early, understand what we're dealing with. But as we're capturing these patients, we are trying to understand how these tumors behave on a cellular, molecular and genetic level. This is very new, and it's an area of interesting science," Dr. Reisenauer says.</p>

<p>Stomach cancer is relatively rare in the U.S. It's often diagnosed at later stages in the disease, when symptoms like nausea, heartburn and feeling bloated are more pronounced.</p>



<p>"In general, when we talk about gastric cancer, we usually talk about a cancer that's arising from the lining of the stomach," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sonbol-mohamad-bassam-b-m-d/bio-20466252?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mohamad Sonbol</a>, a Mayo Clinic oncologist.</p>



<p>Early signs of stomach cancer vary, and can include abdominal pain, blood in the stool or just feeling tired.</p>



<p>"If you have a cancer in the stomach, it might ooze blood very slowly, and that can cause anemia, or low hemoglobin, and that can lead to fatigue," says Dr. Sonbol.</p>



<p>If you're a man, you're at higher risk for stomach cancer than a woman. Other risk factors include obesity, smoking and drinking alcohol.</p>



<p>"And then there are other risk factors, such as there are some hereditary syndromes or things that we inherit from our parents that put us at higher risk of developing gastric cancer, stomach cancer," says Dr. Sonbol.</p>



<p>Treatment options depend on the cancer's location in the stomach, its size and stage, but can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>"I tell patients who have recently been diagnosed with gastric cancer that there is definitely a hope because we've gotten significantly better in the last decade, and more specifically really, in the last year or two, where we have now many more treatment options than we had before," says Dr. Sonbol.</p>
