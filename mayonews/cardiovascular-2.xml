										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A recent study based on real-world community patient data confirms the effectiveness of the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE), developed by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology in 2013. The PCE is used to estimate a person's 10-year risk of developing clogged arteries, also known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atherosclerosis</a>, and guide heart attack and stroke prevention efforts. Study findings are published in the <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.07.018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American College of Cardiology</a>.</p>



<p>The new study highlights to patients and clinicians the continued reliability and effectiveness of the PCE as a tool for assessing cardiovascular risk, regardless of statin use to lower cholesterol.</p>



<p>The PCE serves as a shared decision-making tool for a clinician and patient to evaluate their current status in preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The calculator considers input in the categories of gender, age, race, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for high blood pressure, diabetes status, and smoking status.</p>



<p>Using retrospective data from more than 30,000 patients enrolled in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/quantitative-health-sciences/divisions/epidemiology/research/rochester-epidemiology-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rochester Epidemiology Project</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers found the PCE performed well at the community level and with relative accuracy between sexes, across age groups and race. The use of statin medications to lower cholesterol did not change the value of the predictions, even though the PCE was developed before statins became widely available. The tool also retained its accuracy when using measurement factors, such as blood pressure, age and cholesterol levels, that were outside the original risk profile range.</p>



<p>"We have seen the excellent performance of the Pooled Cohort Equation over the years in clinical practice," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-b-a/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study. "The study shows that this tool is reliable, not only in light of new cholesterol-lowering drugs, but for patients who previously were not evaluated with the PCE because maybe their blood pressure was higher or lower than the standards, or they did not fit the age profile, for example. By including patients with values outside the accepted range, I think we can calculate the risk for heart attacks in another 20% to 25% of patients, which is not small."<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>

<p>Lifestyle modification is essentially the mainstay of cardiovascular disease prevention, and clinicians talk with patients about what to focus on to prevent the serious consequences of a heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>"Beyond wellness questions about exercise, diet, stress level and good sleep, the PCE guides the conversation to decide if it's time to talk about starting treatment for high cholesterol or hypertension. With this study, we wanted to provide confidence that the Pooled Cohort Equation still performs well at the community level, and our data supports that," says Jose Medina-Inojosa, M.D., a research scientist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Statins are medications that reduce the amount of cholesterol made by the liver.</p>



<p>"Cholesterol builds within plaques that accumulate and grow inside the arteries, sometimes to the point that those arteries will be blocked," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenz.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/cholesterol.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-263459" style="width:550px;height:309px" width="550" height="309" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/cholesterol.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/cholesterol-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A medical illustration of cholesterol plaque in an artery.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>And blocked arteries can lead to coronary heart disease. But are statins for everyone?&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The patients that will benefit from taking statins the most will be individuals with history of heart attacks, strokes and other conditions known to be caused by cholesterol plaques," he says.</p>



<p>Diet also plays an important role. Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says to eat less processed meat and more grains, fruits and vegetables.</p>



<p>"The most impactful changes people can make to lower cholesterol will include consuming less animal products other than fish, consuming less saturated fat," he says.</p>



<p>And if your healthcare team recommends medication as well as lifestyle changes?</p>



<p>"Take those medications, check your numbers, be sure that all those factors are well under control,” says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>"Colorectal cancers and breast cancers are on the rise in the Hispanic community. And one of those reasons may be from lack of preventive screening," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says culture, access to care and past experiences contribute. But early screening can prevent future serious health issues.</p>



<p>"Screening tests for diabetes&nbsp;(such as checking a simple blood sugar), for cardiovascular disease to prevent strokes&nbsp;(such as checking on cholesterol and blood pressure), colon cancer screening,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/when-to-start-regular-breast-cancer-screenings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer screening</a>&nbsp;for females, are all available tools," he says.</p>



<p>Talk with your doctor to determine the right preventive screenings and when to begin. For instance:&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Colon cancer screening for both men and women, usually at age 45, is an option, breast cancer screening for women in their 40s such as with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram,</a>" he says.</p>

Some raise your blood pressure. Others make medicines you take to lower your blood pressure less effective. Some medicines that affect blood pressure are prescribed by your healthcare team. Others are available without a prescription.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>How medications can affect your blood pressure</strong></h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Pain medications</strong> </h3>



<p>Some medicines that relieve pain and swelling cause the body to hold onto water. Too much water in the body may create kidney problems and raise blood pressure.</p>



<p>Examples of these medications include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Indomethacin (Indocin).</li>



<li>Medicines available without a prescription such as aspirin (multiple doses a day), naproxen sodium (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others).</li>



<li>Piroxicam (Feldene).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Cold medicines, also called decongestants</strong></h3>



<p>Decongestants make blood vessels smaller, which makes it harder for blood to flow through the blood vessels. Sometimes that raises blood pressure. Decongestants also may make some blood pressure medicines not work as well.</p>



<p>Examples of decongestants include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed 24 Hour).</li>



<li>Phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Antidepressants</strong></h3>



<p>Antidepressants work by changing the body's response to brain chemicals that affect mood. These chemicals also may raise blood pressure.</p>



<p>Examples of antidepressants that can raise blood pressure include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</li>



<li>Tricyclic antidepressants.</li>



<li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Birth control with hormones</strong></h3>



<p>Birth control pills and some birth control devices contain hormones. These hormones may raise blood pressure by making some blood vessels smaller, which makes it harder for blood to flow. Most birth control pills, patches and other devices carry warnings that high blood pressure may be a side effect. The risk of high blood pressure is higher if you're older than 35, overweight or a smoker.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Caffeine</strong></h3>



<p>Caffeine can cause a short-term spike in blood pressure in people who don't use it all the time. It helps to keep blood vessels open, which allows blood to flow easily and may raise blood pressure for a short period of time. There isn't enough evidence to prove that caffeine raises blood pressure long term, though.</p>



<p>Examples of medicines and products with caffeine include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Caffeine pills (Vivarin, NoDoz, others).</li>



<li>Coffee.</li>



<li>Energy drinks and other beverages.</li>
</ul>



<p>The amount of caffeine in coffee varies widely, so it's difficult to say how many cups of coffee you can safely drink a day. Check your blood pressure about 30 minutes before and about 30 minutes after drinking a cup of coffee or another beverage that has caffeine. If your blood pressure goes up by 5 to 10 points, you may be sensitive to caffeine's effect on blood pressure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Herbal supplements</strong></h3>



<p>Herbal supplements may not be safe just because they're natural. Check with your healthcare team before taking any herbal supplements. You may need to avoid supplements that raise your blood pressure or make your blood pressure medicines less effective.</p>



<p>Examples of herbal supplements that may affect your blood pressure or blood pressure medicines include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Arnica (Arnica montana).</li>



<li>Ephedra (ma-huang).</li>



<li>Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius, Panax ginseng).</li>



<li>Guarana (Paullinia cupana).</li>



<li>Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Biological therapies</strong></h3>



<p>Powerful medicines used in biological therapies can have side effects. One of those side effects is high blood pressure. Some of these medicines target specific cells. Others use the body's own immune system to fight some autoimmune diseases and cancers.</p>



<p>Angiogenesis inhibitors and some monoclonal antibodies may raise blood pressure. Examples of these medicines include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bevacizumab (Avastin).</li>



<li>Gefitinib (Iressa).</li>



<li>Imatinib (Gleevec).</li>



<li>Pazopanib (Votrient).</li>



<li>Ramucirumab (Cyramza).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Immunosuppressants</strong></h3>



<p>Most people who've had an organ transplant take immunosuppressants. These medicines help keep the body from rejecting the new organ. Some immunosuppressants can raise blood pressure. This may be due to the ways immunosuppressants affect the kidneys.</p>



<p>Examples of immunosuppressants that can raise blood pressure include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune).</li>



<li>Tacrolimus (Astagraf XL, Prograf, Envarsus XR).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Stimulants</strong></h3>



<p>Stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin, others), can cause the heart to beat faster or unevenly. This may raise blood pressure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>A caution on illegal drugs</strong></h3>



<p>Illegal drugs can raise blood pressure. They may narrow the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This raises heart rate and damages heart muscle.</p>



<p>Examples of illegal drugs that may affect your heart include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Amphetamines, including methamphetamine.</li>



<li>Cocaine.</li>



<li>Ecstasy (MDMA).</li>
</ul>



<p>If you're using illegal drugs, it's important to stop. Ask your healthcare professional for information on counseling or drug treatment programs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Next steps</strong> <strong>about medications and your blood pressure</strong></h3>



<p>Talk with your healthcare professional if you have concerns about the medications or supplements you're using affecting your blood pressure. Have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If your blood pressure goes up or isn't well controlled, ask about other medications or supplements you can take. Your healthcare team may recommend lifestyle changes or additional medications to control your high blood pressure.</p>

<p>A normal heart rhythm should beat like a steady drum. Atrial fibrillation is like a chaotic drumbeat.</p>



<p>"It's a bum, bum-bum, bum-bum-bum, bum-bum- bum-bum-bum. So what you're having is you're having heartbeats that are going sooner or shorter — bum-bum — or longer — bum-bum-bum, bum. And what that's doing is it's altering the ability of your heart to fill and your heart to pump blood effectively," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/desimone-christopher-v-m-d-ph-d/bio-20209047?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/desimone-christopher-v-m-d-ph-d/bio-20209047?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Christopher DeSimone</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.</p>



<p>That can put patients at greater risk of blood clots, heart failure and stroke.</p>



<p>"The heart is like a house. You have the upstairs, you have the downstairs, and you have electricity going on at the top of the heart. And it's coordinated to beat and pump in a fashion so that blood gets to the rest of your body by going from the top, down through the middle of the heart, out to the bottom of the heart into the basement. The top chambers of the heart are where the problem lies for atrial fibrillation," says Dr. DeSimone.</p>



<p>There are many causes, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or even sleep apnea. Often patients are unaware they have atrial fibrillation.</p>



<p>"Sometimes they'll describe to me that they feel fatigued. They're more short of breath. They feel like they're getting older. They feel like they haven't been as active. But really what they're feeling is not effective blood pumping," says Dr. DeSimone.</p>



<p>Treatment is individualized for each patient and may include medication; administering an electrical shock to the heart; or a procedure called catheter ablation, which scars the heart tissue that's creating the erratic signals.</p>

<p>For much of his life, Mark Kocak kept in great shape, lifting weights, doing aerobics and yoga, all while being an avid runner. But as he approached his 60s, Mark found himself dealing with high LDL (or “bad”) <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>. His primary care doctor recommended he go on a statin, but Mark refused, until one day, “I felt a little weird and thought maybe I was having a heart attack,” Mark says. Though the episode was a false alarm, it served as a wake-up call for Mark.</p>



<p>“My primary doctor, for the last few years, had been recommending I go to a cardiologist because of my high cholesterol and things like that, and I'd been kind of kicking the can down the road,” says Mark, now 62 and recently retired from teaching health and physical education at a junior high school in southwest Minnesota. “But when I had that scare with my heart, I decided I better see one. And I knew right away where I wanted to go, and that was Mayo Clinic.”</p>



<p>At Mayo, Mark came under the care of preventive cardiologist <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vasile-vlad-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20513797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vlad Vasile, M.D.</a>, Ph.D., co-director of Mayo’s Clinical Specialty Laboratory, who recommended he undergo ceramide testing. A novel assay developed at Mayo, ceramide testing can reveal more about heart disease and stroke risk than standard lipid tests. Ceramides are sphingolipids, found everywhere in our body. Though they are “ubiquitously expressed,” the test focuses primarily on three ceramides of cardiovascular interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The beauty of these three ceramides is they’re involved in different pathways,” says Dr. Vasile, who also serves as medical director of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-health-clinic/overview/ovc-20442224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s Cardiovascular Health Clinic</a>. “All of them are involved in plaque formation. Some reflect inflammation, some reflect the bad cholesterol, and some reflect coagulation or thickening of the blood.”</p>



<p>Jeff Meeusen, Ph.D., who co-directs Mayo’s Clinical Specialty Laboratory alongside Dr. Vasile, believes ceramides to be “a very biologically active group” of signal molecules. “So, whereas cholesterol is more or less a scaffolding, a building block that the cells can use to make other things, these ceramides seem to be specific actors in these different roles,” he says. “When they’re imbalanced they seem to have a stronger physiological signal that informs our ceramide test.”</p>



<p><strong>Moving beyond the gray area of risk calculators</strong></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic’s ceramide test uses liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technology to sort through complex molecular compounds and render an algorithmic score — a simple number that places the patient in a “bucket” of risk. For clinicians, it’s easy to interpret because this number is correlated with one of four risk categories, from low to very high risk. The test is also available to physicians outside of Mayo Clinic; one need only send in a patient’s blood specimen to receive their ceramide score.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“I WOULD SAY ABOUT HALF OF OUR CERAMIDE TEST ORDERS ARE EXTERNAL AND THE OTHER HALF ARE FROM MAYO CLINIC PHYSICIANS,” DR. MEEUSEN SAYS. “BUT BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONLY CENTER OFFERING THIS TEST RIGHT NOW, VERY FEW PHYSICIANS KNOW ABOUT IT. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE’S QUITE A BIT OF LITERATURE BUILDING UP IN ITS SUPPORT.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When Mark came to Dr. Vasile, besides high cholesterol, he also had stage 1 <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20045868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension</a>.</p>



<p>“His LDL level was 137, which was not really at goal,” Dr. Vasile says. “And he has a family history of premature coronary artery disease in first-degree relatives, so I ran the ASCVD calculator (a tool that estimates a patient’s 10-year risk of heart attack), which put him in a gray area of intermediate risk.”</p>



<p>Cardiologists like Dr. Vasile also use chest imaging and traditional blood tests to indicate coronary artery disease risk factors. But even this testing is limited, as are current risk calculators.</p>



<p>“We’re looking at many, many things, not just one parameter,” Dr. Vasile says. “With these calculators, we plug in all these clinical parameters, like blood data such as cholesterol, the demographics of the patient, and these calculators render a certain risk for developing heart attacks and strokes within a certain time span. But we know very well that these calculators are far from being perfect. There is a lot of criticism with such calculators because coronary artery disease and plaque formation are very complex and multifactorial processes.”</p>



<p>Dr. Vasile continues, “So, here’s this patient, Mr. Mark Kocak, who comes to me with a high LDL cholesterol of 137 mg/dL and a strong family history of heart disease. He’s also at higher risk because he’s a male. Should I target for him an LDL of less than 100, or should I be more aggressive and target an LDL of less than 70? The ASCVD risk calculator was not very helpful in this situation because it ignores family history completely, and so I needed more information.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Targeting LDL numbers to fit the individual</strong></h2>



<p>This is where ceramide testing becomes invaluable for Dr. Vasile. It’s a tool that helps him push through these gray area scenarios and better individualize treatment plans for patients. Mark’s ceramide score was zero, which placed him at low cardiovascular risk — unlike another patient of Dr. Vasile,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mayocliniclabs.com/2023/08/07/ceramide-testing-helps-reduce-risk-of-heart-attack-stephanie-blendermann/">Stephanie Blendermann</a>, whose score was an 8, which put her at high risk.</p>



<p>“So, his score was in opposition to Mrs. Blendermann’s, who had a high score and a similar family history,” Dr. Vasile says. “This told me that Mr. Kocak’s family history probably doesn’t have a significant influence on him. So, we jointly decided that because his ceramide score was zero, we shouldn’t be as aggressive with him as we were for Mrs. Blendermann, whose LDL we targeted at less than 70 milligrams per deciliter. His score told us we should target an LDL number of less than 100, which is the risk category for the average person walking the street.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Higher LDL levels are correlated with heart attacks and strokes; thus, the lower the LDL, the lower the risk of developing these events down the line. To reduce Mark’s risk and bring his LDL to goal, Dr. Vasile recommended a statin and medication for hypertension.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“WITHOUT THAT CERAMIDE SCORE, I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COMPLETELY SAY, ‘YEAH, I WANT THIS PATIENT’S LDL TO BE BELOW 100 OR BELOW 70,’” DR. VASILE SAYS. “AND TO REACH THAT SPECIFIC GOAL FOR THE LDL, IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS WHAT DOSE OF STATIN YOU ARE ON.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Though his ceramide score put him at low risk, Mark heeded Dr. Vasile’s recommendation to go on meds to further decrease his chances of an event. “If a statin and then a low-dose hypertension pill can keep a heart attack at bay, it’s sort of a no-brainer,” Mark says. “I agreed with him on that, and it was part of our preventative plan.”</p>

<p></p>



<p style="font-size:18px">Dr. Vasile also urged Mark to continue his aerobic exercise program, weight training, and yoga, and had him talk with a dietician in Mayo’s Cardiovascular Health Clinic, who recommended he begin following a Mediterranean diet. Meanwhile, Mark continues to run, though he’s taking it a bit easier these days. “I’m down to 5 and 10Ks,” he says. “Those are a lot more comfortable at this age.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of his preventative plan, Mark will be re-tested for his ceramide score on follow-up visits with Dr. Vasile so that any change can be caught early, and his treatment adjusted accordingly. Although he resisted taking medications for a time, Mark says, “I've always tried to be proactive. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I think medicine’s trying to head that way, getting in on the front end of preventing things, versus having to deal with the aftermath. But Mayo is just an amazing place, leading the way. My family is really blessed to have a facility like this so close to home.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Pericarditis is simply inflammation of the lining of the heart tissue, or the pericardium," says Dr. Cooper.</p>



<p>When the irritated layers of the pericardium rub together, it can cause sharp chest pain, a symptom that can often be mistaken for a heart attack, which can make it difficult to diagnose.</p>



<p>"Pericarditis has a classic type of chest pain, better if you lean forward and worse if you lay on your back," says Dr. Cooper.</p>



<p>"Most patients who develop pericarditis have had a recent viral infection, and those affect people of all ages, but especially young individuals, more commonly males than females in the general population," he says.</p>



<p>Other less common causes include chronic health conditions, such as kidney failure, cancer, prior radiation and atypical infections.</p>



<p>"The good news is that the vast majority of people with pericarditis recover and have normal lives with no further symptoms. A small percentage will go on to have a chronic or recurrent chest pain syndrome. Chronic pericarditis has specific therapies," says Dr. Cooper.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carotid-artery-disease/basics/definition/con-20030206" target="_blank">Carotid artery disease</a>&nbsp;occurs when the blood vessels supplying your brain and head, known as carotid arteries, are damaged or blocked by fatty deposits. These deposits contain cholesterol that organizes as a plaque, which clogs or blocks the carotid arteries. This is similar to coronary artery disease, which reduces blood flow to your heart.</p>



<p>This blockage in blood vessels increases your risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/is-it-a-stroke-how-to-know-and-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>&nbsp;— a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or seriously reduced. When a stroke occurs, oxygen can't reach the brain, and brain cells begin to die within minutes.</p>



<p>Usually, carotid artery disease develops slowly. The first sign that you have the disease may be a stroke or transient ischemic attack, or TIA, a temporary decrease of blood flow to your brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is at risk for carotid artery disease?</h2>



<p>Your risk of developing carotid artery disease increases if you have a family history of the disease or&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/basics/definition/con-20026972" target="_blank">atherosclerosis</a>. Age also is a risk factor. As you age, your arteries become less flexible and are more easily damaged.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Other risk factors for carotid artery disease include:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Diabetes</li>



<li>High blood-fat levels</li>



<li>High blood pressure</li>



<li>Lack of exercise</li>



<li>Obesity</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/-/media/local-files/eau-claire/images/medical-services/pulmonology/upper-airway-stimulation-therapy.jpg">Sleep apnea</a></li>



<li>Tobacco use</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are treatments for carotid artery disease?</h2>



<p>Preventing a stroke is the primary goal of treating carotid artery disease. A treatment plan will be based on the degree of blockage in your carotid arteries and could include a combination of lifestyle modifications, medications and surgery.</p>



<p>Treatment for mild to moderate blockages may include lifestyle changes to slow the progression of damage to your arteries, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/a-smokers-guide-to-quitting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quitting smoking</a>, losing weight, reducing salt intake and exercising regularly. Medication to control blood pressure, lower cholesterol or prevent blood clots also may be recommended.</p>



<p>Your care team may recommend removing the blockage from the artery if it is causing severe narrowing or if you have already had a stroke or TIA.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">There are different options to remove the blockage from the carotid artery:</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Carotid endarterectomy</h4>



<p>This is the most common treatment for carotid artery disease and involves cutting along the front of the neck to open the carotid artery. The blood flow is temporarily stopped while removing the plaque causing the clog or blockage. At the end of the procedure, the artery is closed with a patch made from a vein, an artificial material or the lining of a cow's heart.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Carotid stenting</h4>



<p>There are two types of carotid stenting: transcarotid and transfemoral.</p>



<p>Transcarotid artery revascularization, or TCAR, is a minimally invasive procedure that treats carotid artery disease and helps prevent strokes. During the procedure, a small incision is made just above the collarbone to access the carotid artery. A tube or catheter is placed into the artery and connected to a transcarotid neuro-protection system, or NPS. This system diverts blood flow through a filter or basket that catches and prevents loose plaque or debris from entering the brain. After the plaque and debris are collected by the device filter, the blood is returned to a vessel in the leg. Then a wireless mesh tube, called a stent, is inserted to stabilize the blockage site and normal blood flow is resumed.</p>



<p>Transfemoral carotid stenting is considered when carotid endarterectomy or transcarotid stenting is not feasible. A tube or catheter is inserted in the groin. A wire and catheter are navigated to the carotid artery's diseased section. A filter or basket placed just beyond the blockage catches plaque or debris that becomes loose during the procedure before entering the brain. A stent is inserted to stabilize the blockage site, and the filter is removed at the end of the procedure. Transfemoral carotid stenting carries a risk of stroke during the procedure that is twice as high as carotid endarterectomy or transcarotid stenting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are there ways to reduce the risk of developing carotid artery disease?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To prevent or slow the progression of carotid artery disease, take these steps to manage your risk factors:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Control chronic conditions.</strong><br>Manage any chronic conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.</li>



<li><strong>Consider limiting your salt intake.</strong><br>Reducing sodium can help lower your risk of developing high blood pressure.</li>



<li><strong>Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-big-deal-about-the-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Healthy foods</a>&nbsp;provide valuable nutrients for your body, which may protect you from a stroke.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong><br>Being physically active can improve the health of your blood vessels and heart.</li>



<li><strong>Limit cholesterol and fat intake.</strong><br>This may help reduce the accumulation of plaque in your arteries.</li>



<li><strong>Limit your alcohol intake.</strong><br>Drinking alcohol in excess increases your risk for carotid artery disease.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight.</strong><br>Maintaining a healthy weight reduces your risk of developing high blood pressure, diabetes and other health risks.</li>



<li><strong>Quit smoking or don't start.</strong><br>After just a few years, a nonsmoker's and a former smoker's risk of stroke are comparable.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps:</h2>



<ul>
<li>Request an appointment with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/vascular-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vascular medicine specialist</a>.</li>



<li>Learn about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-other-arterial-disease">peripheral artery disease</a>&nbsp;— another type of arterial disease.</li>

<p>"Obesity has been a major health issue in the Hispanic population in the United States, resulting in health complications like diabetes and heart disease" says Dr. Leoni Moreno. He says there are many factors.</p>



<p>"This population has difficult access to healthcare, difficult access to guidance on prevention and management," he says.</p>



<p>That's where lifestyle changes can help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dietary choices, like fresh fruit and vegetables, can replace processed foods high in fat and sugar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Staying active can help lower complications too. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of regular exercise a week," says Dr. Leoni Moreno.</p>



<p>“It’s better to prevent disease than to have to treat the disease. We want to see these patients at the right time," he says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Eating for heart health</h3>

<p>A regular diet that's high in salt, fat and sugar can increase your risk for heart disease. Following a healthy diet can help the heart, control blood pressure and cholesterol, and lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are strategies everyone can follow for heart health:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eat more vegetables and fruits: They provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber that protect your heart and help cut calories.</li>



<li>Choose whole grains: Opt for whole grains over refined grains to support blood pressure and heart health.</li>



<li>Healthy fats: Pick monounsaturated and polyunsaturated over saturated and trans fats to lower cholesterol.</li>



<li>Choose lean proteins: Lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy and legumes as protein sources.</li>



<li>Reduce salt intake: Lower salt consumption to prevent high blood pressure and heart disease.</li>



<li>Control portion size: Be mindful of how much you eat to avoid excess calories.</li>



<li>Plan daily menus: Emphasize vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats in your meals.</li>



<li>Enjoy occasional treats: It's OK to indulge occasionally, but maintain a mostly healthy eating plan.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:06) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post.&nbsp;Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."&nbsp;Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/08/Mayo-Clinic-Minute-Red-flags-for-heart-failure-during-pregnancy_SCRIPT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>What may appear as normal symptoms during pregnancy may overlap with red flags for heart failure.</p>



<p>"(Symptoms can include) lower extremity swelling, shortness of breath with walking short distances or shortness of breath when laying in the bed flat on your back at night," says Dr. Adedinsewo.</p>



<p>Delays in diagnosis can be deadly. And some who are pregnant have an even greater risk of developing heart failure.</p>



<p>"There is a unique form of heart failure that occurs during pregnancy and shortly after having a baby called peripartum <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiomyopathy</a>," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "Black women have up to a sixteenfold risk of developing this condition, compared to white women."</p>



<p>Eating a healthy diet, exercising, getting enough sleep and not smoking can lower risks. Dr. Adedinsewo recommends attending regular appointments with your healthcare team and checking blood glucose and blood lipids.</p>



<p>"If we are able to test and evaluate a tool that can use something as simple as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983?_ga=2.204175184.1519000234.1596213841-659235982.1596213841?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EKG</a> to identify a woman who's pregnant and at high risk of having heart failure, we can initiate appropriate therapies and reduce the risk of dying during this time period," she says.</p>
