<p>What do tobacco, alcohol and obesity have in common? They can all increase your risk of developing cancer. Smoked tobacco is strongly linked to cancer in almost every part of the body.</p>



<p>"Smoked tobacco produces about 7,000 chemicals, and when you inhale those chemicals in your body, they cause alterations in cells. And it's those alterations in cells that can lead to cancer," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>He says smoking also weakens your immune system, making it harder to fight cancer cells. One of the best ways to lower your cancer risk is to not use any kind of tobacco.</p>



<p>"We always say it's never too late to stop smoking. And the risk for cancer after quitting cigarette smoking, for example, goes down. But it takes some time," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Consuming alcohol increases your risk of breast, head and neck, esophageal, and colorectal cancers.</p>



<p>"At every level of alcohol consumption, there is cancer risk, but heavier drinkers have higher cancer risk than lighter drinkers," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Finally, packing on extra pounds can increase your risk of cancer in several ways.</p>



<p>"Excess body weight increases estrogen and insulin, which can increase the rate of cellular division, which can increase the risk for cancer. But also, excess body weight is associated with inflammation, and inflammation is a known risk factor for the development of cancer," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Bariatric surgery has been shown to decrease risk of hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrial and prostate, as well as pancreatic and colorectal cancers. However, there are less drastic steps people can take.</p>



<p>"Small sustainable steps toward weight loss are the most effective when we think about diet and exercise. Those are the classic approaches, but also there are new medications on the market that can help people lose weight," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>

<p>You may have heard about a recent first at Mayo Clinic, a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-marks-medical-milestone-with-worlds-first-known-successful-total-larynx-transplant-performed-in-a-patient-with-an-active-cancer-as-part-of-a-clinical-trial/">total larynx transplant</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-20055443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. David Lott</a> is a Mayo Clinic otolaryngologist who specializes in laryngeal cancer. He says your larynx, or voice box, essentially sits in the middle of your throat. "And it has a bunch of jobs. It is the primary organ that's responsible for your ability to speak, for your ability to swallow, to eat and drink, and to breathe," says Dr. Lott.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, like the rest of your body, things can go wrong, including cancer.</p>



<p>"Laryngeal chondrosarcoma are cancers of the cartilage within the larynx," says Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>It's an uncommon cancer, accounting for about 1% of overall laryngeal cancers. Symptoms may include hoarseness, breathing difficulties and pain in the throat. "Laryngeal chondrosarcomas are treated a little bit differently than the typical laryngeal cancers," adds Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>Step 1, he says, is determining the grade of cancer. Is it mild or a more aggressive form?</p>



<p>"If there's a lot of destruction and the patient is having a lot of symptoms, like not being able to breathe or not being able to swallow or have lost their voice, then we need to act a little more aggressively to try to remove that tumor to try to preserve what function they have," says Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>Because of its rarity and the intricate anatomy, this cancer type needs specialized care from a team of experts, including otolaryngologists and oncologists. According to Dr. Lott, unlike many cancers, even some other laryngeal cancers, "there really isn't much that people do to get that type of a cancer. It's not strictly associated with things like smoking or alcohol use. It tends to be, honestly, just bad luck."</p>

<p>What if you knew you'd get sick before you ever felt symptoms? If it was a cold, that information is useful. In the case of cancer, it is lifesaving. This week's podcast episode of <a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=tcepisodethree&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=global&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=185874" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomorrow's Cure</a> explores how DNA could be used to detect blood cancers before they ever develop.</p>



<p>Episode experts include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/patnaik-mrinal-s-mbbs/bio-20055415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mrinal Patnaik</a>, a hematologist, internist and oncologist at Mayo Clinic; and <a href="https://oncology.wustl.edu/people/kelly-bolton-md-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kelly Bolton</a>, an oncologist at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>



<p>"We're developing tests where we can actually detect the early first step in the multistep progression to cancer," Dr. Bolton says. "That's an area where we might be able to intervene on someone's genetic changes that haven't quite led to cancer, but that are very high risk of becoming a cancer."</p>



<p>"When we detect clonal hematopoiesis, we want to nip it in the bud and prevent those high-risk patients from developing blood cancer because they are often lethal, difficult to treat. So the earlier we can effectively and safely intervene, the better for the patients,” says Dr. Patnaik.</p>

<p>On Feb. 29, Marty Kedian made history by successfully undergoing a groundbreaking surgery at Mayo Clinic that is providing hope to thousands who have lost their voice and ability to swallow and breathe on their own due to diminished laryngeal function or total loss of their larynx.</p>



<p>This is the third known larynx transplant in the U.S. and the first known case performed on a patient with an active cancer as part of a clinical trial. It is also Mayo Clinic's first total larynx transplant. The multidisciplinary team, including six surgeons, was led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-20055443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. David Lott</a>, chair of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20424084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Otolaryngology (ENT) - Head and Neck Surgery/Audiology at Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>. Dr. Lott also leads <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Larynx and Trachea Transplant Program</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897">.</a></p>



<p>Experts say the larynx transplant at Mayo is a pivotal milestone in making the rare procedure available as a scientifically proven, safe and effective procedure for a wider population.</p>



<p>For Marty, it marks the beginning of his quest to break the silence on laryngeal transplantation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Silenced by cancer</strong></h2>



<p>"I love to talk to people everywhere I go," says Marty. "I'm that guy at the baseball game who doesn't know anyone sitting around them. And by the end of the game, I'm friends with everyone in my section."</p>



<p>Marty's world changed in 2013 when he went to the doctor after noticing he was having trouble swallowing his food. "Food was getting caught in my throat. I thought I had allergies. I didn't really think anything of it," recalls Marty.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="909" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-1024x909.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390166" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-1024x909.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-300x266.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-768x682.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-1536x1364.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-2048x1818.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Marty and Gina Kedian</strong> <strong>and their dog Baxter</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>A series of tests revealed Marty had a rare form of laryngeal cancer called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chondrosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chondrosarcoma</a>. Doctors told Marty he needed surgery. "It was a shock," recalls Marty. "It was devastating. I wasn't going to die, but I had a job that required me to talk to people all day long." For 35 years, Marty worked at a local print shop speaking with customers in Haverhill, Massachusetts, where he lives with his wife, Gina, and their family.</p>



<p>Marty underwent his first surgery in 2014. Over the next 10 years, dozens more followed, reducing Marty's voice to a raspy whisper. No longer able to breathe on his own, Marty underwent surgery to have a tracheostomy tube inserted so he could breathe through a hole in the front of his neck.</p>



<p>"Everywhere I went, the first thing people would ask me is, 'How many cigarettes did you smoke a day?' I never smoked a cigarette in my life," says Marty. "People would immediately shut down and back away from me. After a while, I just didn't want to go out anywhere. I was alive, but I wasn't living." Marty was eventually told his last option was a total laryngectomy, or removal of his voice box. He declined. "I didn't want a laryngectomy. I wanted to find a way to get my quality of life back," says Marty.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390142" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Marty with his granddaughter, Charlotte   Photo courtesy: Kedian Family</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I just had my first grandchild. I wanted to be able to talk to her with my own voice, play with her in the yard and take her to baseball games and breathe normally. Gina knew I was already depressed and out of my mind. She kept saying there had to be another way. She went online, and that's when she found Dr. Lott."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding hope at Mayo Clinic</h2>



<p>Thousands of miles from Marty's home, at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Dr. Lott was leading a team of scientists researching laryngeal restoration and transplantation. Dr. Lott is an ear, nose and throat surgeon who specializes in laryngeal surgery. For the past two decades, Dr. Lott and his team have been <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/head-and-neck-regenerative-medicine/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigating ways to restore and save a person's voice and laryngeal function.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="698" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-698x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390168" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-204x300.jpg 204w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-1047x1536.jpg 1047w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116.jpg 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Dr. David Lott discusses laryngeal transplantation with Kedian at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I set my path on becoming a laryngeal surgeon and researcher to build a program that is pushing the boundaries of science forward," explains Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>"Nobody really thinks of their larynx until it's gone," says Dr. Lott. "Then your ability to speak, breathe and swallow is gone, and you are left breathing through a hole in your neck. It is very isolating, and many become a shell of who they used to be. I wanted to find a way to help restore a person's quality of life."</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/preparing-for-mayos-first-larynx-transplant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In 2016, Dr. Lott's program was granted approval to conduct the first clinical trial in the U.S. on laryngeal transplantation</a>. "Until now, laryngeal transplants have been done as on-offs," says Dr. Lott. "This clinical trial allows us to conduct a true scientific investigation aimed at thoroughly researching the safety and efficacy of laryngeal transplantation as a trusted option for patients."</p>



<p>One of the biggest challenges to advancing laryngeal transplantation as an option for cancer patients like Marty has been the risk associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapy. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/11-16-four-ways-organ-transplants-are-being-transformed-to-save-more-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transplant</a> patients are given immunosuppressive drugs to lower the body's immune response, which reduces the risk of organ rejection. However, immunosuppression also increases the risk of the cancer spreading. Marty was already on immunosuppressives due to a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-surgeons-perform-first-robotic-assisted-kidney-transplant-in-minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> years ago.</p>



<p>"Having a patient with an active cancer who already has his own immune suppression allowed us to do the transplant safely without introducing additional risk in a way that has rarely, if ever, been done before," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Girish Mour, M.B.B.S.,</a> medical director of the program.</p>

<p>Removing the cancer was the surgical team's main priority. "First, we removed Mr. Kedian's cancerous larynx," explains Dr. Lott. "Then, with the confidence of our team that the cancer was gone, we focused on the transplant. The entire procedure went better than we expected."</p>



<p>In addition to the larynx, surgeons transplanted the pharynx, upper trachea, upper esophagus, thyroid and parathyroid glands, blood vessels, and nerves.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Marty's road to recovery</strong></h1>



<p>Four months after his transplant, Marty regained 60% of his voice. Doctors say it will continue to improve as he heals over the next year. He has also regained the ability to swallow and breathe on his own. "It is truly amazing," says Marty. "Dr. Lott and the team at Mayo have not only given me my voice back, they've also given me my life back."</p>



<p>Speech and swallow therapy at Mayo has been a significant part of Marty's recovery.</p>



<p>"Marty's progress is remarkable," describes Dr. Lott. "He is eating hamburgers, macaroni and cheese, almost anything with no problem. His breathing also continues to steadily improve." Doctors plan to remove the tracheostomy tube when Marty regains full function of his ability to breathe on his own.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>"The holy grail for managing laryngeal cancer"</strong></h1>



<p>"The case signifies a monumental breakthrough," says Dr. Marshall Strome, who performed the world's first successful larynx transplant in 1998. "It represents the future of laryngeal transplantation where every patient needing a total laryngectomy will have the option of a reconstruction that allows them to maintain their quality of life."</p>



<p>Dr. Lott did some of his early training under Dr. Strome. Since then, Dr. Strome has remained a trusted mentor to Dr. Lott. In a full circle moment, Dr. Strome was present when Dr. Lott performed the transplant at Mayo in February.</p>



<p>"With the clinical trial underway, Dr. Lott and his team are positioned to advance the field in ways no other program can currently achieve. The Mayo team has discovered the holy grail for managing laryngeal cancer, which I believe will come to fruition by the end of this decade," says Dr. Strome.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Breaking the silence on laryngeal transplantation</strong></h1>



<p>Less than five months after surgery, Marty and Gina are excited to return home to Massachusetts. "We couldn't have done this without everyone's love and support," says Gina.</p>



<p>"I will always be grateful to the team at Mayo and especially for the generosity of my organ donor and the donor family," says Marty.</p>



<p>Dr. Lott's clinical trial is approved to perform additional larynx transplants in the coming years.</p>



<p>Marty is looking forward to doing what he loves most — talking to family, friends and everyone else he meets. He is especially looking forward to talking with his granddaughter, Charlotte.</p>



<p>"I will be reading her lots of bedtime stories," says Marty. Meanwhile, Marty also is planning to share his own story to inspire others.</p>



<p>"My first job is to get better," says Marty. "My next job will be to tell everyone they can do it too."</p>

<p>PHOENIX — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> announces a groundbreaking achievement in organ transplantation, offering hope to thousands who have lost their ability to speak, swallow and breathe on their own due to diminished function or loss of their larynx. A multidisciplinary team of doctors in Arizona performed the third known total larynx transplant in the U.S. The case also marks a medical milestone as the first known total larynx transplant performed as part of a clinical trial and the first on a patient with active cancer in the U.S.</p>



<p>"The surgery and patient's progress have exceeded our expectations," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-20055443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology (ENT) - <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/head-and-neck-cancer-center/sections/overview/ovc-20457072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Surgery</a>/Audiology at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>. "This is a tremendous accomplishment in launching what we believe is the future for laryngeal transplantation."</p>



<p>A paper by Dr. Lott on the case was published July 9 in the peer-reviewed medical journal <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/jmcp/Lott-1720450777830.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>. The larynx, located in the throat, is commonly known as the voice box. Larynx transplantation is a rare and complex procedure, performed only a handful of times in the world. Even more notably, Mayo Clinic's surgical team successfully performed the larynx transplant on a patient with an active cancer, making it one of the first cases of its kind globally.</p>



<p>Six surgeons at Mayo Clinic conducted the 21-hour transplant, which included the larynx, pharynx, upper trachea, upper esophagus, thyroid and parathyroid glands, blood vessels, and nerves.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a> was performed on a Massachusetts man, Marty Kedian, who was diagnosed with a rare form of laryngeal cancer called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chondrosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chondrosarcoma</a>. For 10 years, Kedian underwent dozens of surgeries, which eventually robbed him of his voice and his ability to swallow and breathe normally. Several years ago, Kedian had to undergo a tracheostomy that allowed him to breathe through a hole in his neck. He says the tracheostomy, combined with the loss of his voice, significantly diminished his quality of life. "I was alive, but I wasn't living," says Kedian. "I love to talk to people everywhere I go, and I just couldn't. I felt strange, and I wouldn't go out anywhere."</p>



<p>After years of surgeries, doctors told Kedian his only remaining option was to get a laryngectomy and have his larynx completely removed. He declined. "I didn't want a laryngectomy. I wanted to find a way to get my quality of life back," he says.</p>



<p>Kedian found what he was looking for at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Larynx and Trachea Transplant Program</a>, where Dr. Lott was leading the first known clinical trial on laryngeal transplantation in the U.S. After being accepted as a patient for the clinical trial, Kedian and his wife, Gina, moved to a temporary home in Phoenix. On Feb. 29, Kedian became Mayo Clinic's first patient to undergo a total larynx transplant. "I wanted this so I could talk and breathe normally with my new granddaughter. I want to read her bedtime stories with my own voice," says Kedian.</p>



<p>Because it was conducted as part of a clinical trial, Mayo's case is considered a significant pivotal step in making the rare procedure available to a wider population. "Until now, laryngeal transplants have been done as one-offs," says Dr. Lott. "This clinical trial allows us to conduct a true scientific investigation aimed at thoroughly researching the safety and efficacy of laryngeal transplantation as a trusted option for patients." The program is approved to perform additional larynx transplants in the coming years.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cancer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a> estimates there will be 12,650 new cases of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laryngeal cancer</a> in the U.S. this year. Until now, many of these patients had little hope of laryngeal transplantation as a possible option in the future due to the risk associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapy. Transplant patients are given immunosuppressive therapy to lower the body's immune response, which reduces the risk of organ rejection. However, immunosuppressive drugs also increase the risk of the cancer spreading.</p>



<p>Kedian's case was unique. He was already on immunosuppressive therapy from a previous kidney transplant. "Having a patient with an active cancer who already had his own immune suppression allowed us to do the transplant safely without introducing additional risk in a way that has rarely, if ever, been done before," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Girish Mour,</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M.B.B.S.</a>, medical director of the program. Dr. Lott adds, "Being able to perform this transplant in the setting of active cancer in a patient already on immunosuppressive therapy, under the rigor and oversight of a clinical trial, enabled us to take that vital step toward better understanding the safety for cancer patients and potentially making larynx transplant a standard option."</p>



<p>Removing the cancer was the surgical team's main priority. "First, we removed Mr. Kedian's cancerous larynx," explains Dr. Lott. "Then, with the confidence of our team that the cancer was gone, we focused on the transplant."</p>



<p>Four months after surgery, Kedian can speak with his new voice, swallow and breathe on his own, which Dr. Lott calls remarkable. "Mr. Kedian has already regained about 60% of his voice, which I wouldn't have thought would happen for at least a year. He still speaks with the same voice and Boston accent he had prior to the cancer," says Dr. Lott. "He can also eat hamburgers, macaroni and cheese, almost anything, and swallow with no problem. His breathing also continues to steadily improve." Doctors plan to remove the tracheostomy tube when Kedian regains full ability to breathe on his own.</p>



<p>"The team at Mayo has given me my life back," says Kedian. "I'm so grateful. I have the deepest gratitude for Dr. Lott's team and especially the generosity of my organ donor and donor family. I hope one day I get the chance to tell them, 'Thank you.'"</p>



<p>"This case signifies a monumental breakthrough. It represents the future of laryngeal transplantation, where every patient needing a total laryngectomy will have the option of a reconstruction that allows them to maintain their quality of life," says Marshall Strome, M.D., who made medical history by performing the world's first total laryngeal transplant in 1998. "With the clinical trial underway, Dr. Lott and his team are positioned to advance the field in ways no other program can currently achieve. The Mayo team has discovered the holy grail for managing laryngeal cancer, which I believe will come to fruition by the end of this decade."</p>



<p>Dr. Lott calls Kedian's case the capstone of his two decades of research. In addition to the clinical trial, Dr. Lott's research team is investigating ways to restore laryngeal function through improving transplantation techniques and pioneering <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/head-and-neck-regenerative-medicine/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative medicine technologies</a>. "I set my path on becoming a laryngeal surgeon and researcher to build a program that is pushing the boundaries of science forward," says Dr. Lott. "Our dedication is to the thousands of individuals who suffer from laryngeal dysfunction and to find trusted options that preserve their health and their quality of life. That's what this clinical trial is all about."</p>



<p>Kedian returns to Massachusetts next week. He is excited to be back with family and friends and to read bedtime stories to his granddaughter. Kedian also plans to use his own story to inspire others and be a voice for hope. "Mayo and Dr. Lott have helped me regain my quality of life," says Kedian. "My job now is to get better. My next job will be to show others they can do it too."</p>

<p>Melissa Neuman dreaded getting mammograms. Her small, dense breasts made the screening exceptionally uncomfortable and painful. So Melissa put off getting an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/mammography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual mammogram</a>&nbsp;until she felt she couldn't delay any longer.</p>



<p>For about five years, Melissa had been plagued with a nagging pain just under her left breast. In February 2023, a recommendation from a friend led her to seek care from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jessica-johnson-np" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Johnson</a>, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/obstetrics-and-gynecology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OB-GYN</a>&nbsp;nurse practitioner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/owatonna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Owatonna</a>, Minnesota.</p>



<p>"She took me seriously, was curious and determined to find out what was causing the pain," says Melissa, who lives in Owatonna and works as an activities assistant at a local assisted living and memory care facility.</p>



<p>During their appointment, Johnson noticed that Melissa hadn't had a mammogram for several years. When Melissa explained why she was reluctant to be screened, Johnson suggested she have a breast MRI.</p>



<p>"I'd still be getting screened, but with less pain," says Melissa. "So I said, 'Let's do it.'"</p>



<p>The MRI revealed an area of concern. Johnson recommended that Melissa have a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/preparing-for-your-breast-biopsy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biopsy</a>, but it would require a mammogram first. That's when Melissa met Amanda Steinberg, a radiology technologist in Owatonna. She was just the person Melissa needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overcoming mammogram fears, pain</h2>



<p>"Mammograms aren't a favorite activity for women," says Steinberg. "While it's a preventive screening, we have mammograms to make sure we don't have breast cancer. It's scary."</p>



<p>At 35, Steinberg had her own scare with a mammogram that showed an area of concern, so she understands her patients' fears and reluctance. She strives to set them at ease, explain simply and clearly what she's doing, take their mind off the compression and be as quick and effective as possible.</p>



<p>That understanding and empathy resonated with Melissa. So did Amanda's technique. Steinberg had learned that mammograms can be less painful if the patient doesn't reach forward to grip the handles on the machine.</p>



<p>"When you grip or make a fist, your pectoral muscles tense up. Squeezing a muscle that is already tight makes the pinching feeling of compression feel worse," she says.</p>



<p>That clenching also can create an undesirable "C" shape on the image. So instead, she tells patients not to raise their arms and grip but to let them hang relaxed by their sides.</p>



<p>"Women have told me how much better it is," says Steinberg.</p>



<p>Melissa agrees. "She was amazing, and I will never forget her, and I wish I'd found her sooner," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A closer look reveals a tumor</h2>



<p>The mammogram and a subsequent ultrasound were inconclusive, so Johnson ordered a biopsy that was performed on Dec. 6, 2023. Two days later, Melissa learned that the biopsy had confirmed an invasive ductile carcinoma tumor positioned right up against her chest wall.</p>



<p>"Suddenly, everything was insane," says Melissa.</p>



<p>The whirlwind of preoperative tests and appointments began, and she was informed of her options: a lumpectomy, radiation or a single or double mastectomy.</p>



<p>After talking through the options with her husband, Rick, she opted for a double mastectomy.</p>



<p>"I didn't want to undergo MRIs every six months or worry for the rest of my life," says Melissa.</p>



<p>Melissa met with Mayo Clinic Health System surgeons and had a double mastectomy on Jan. 30. After one night in the hospital, she was home and recovering with help from Rick and their children, Sarah and Joshua.</p>



<p>Before starting her on hormone-blocking cancer medication, Melissa's oncologist,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/mina-hanna-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mina Hanna, M.D.</a>, ordered a bone density scan. Melissa was delighted to learn that Amanda would conduct it since she had such a positive experience with the mammograms.</p>



<p>"After I've done mammograms for a patient, I usually don't know their results or even see them again," says Steinberg. "Doing Melissa's bone density scan felt like it was meant to be that we'd be on this journey together."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Genetics, recovery and a night at the ballpark</h2>



<p>At the start of her breast cancer journey, Melissa was surprised to learn her diagnosis because she didn't know of any women in her family who had breast cancer. Tests revealed the cancer was both estrogen and progesterone-positive but negative for BRCA 1 and 2 markers. Melissa wanted to learn more, so she underwent in-depth&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/medical-genetics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetics testing</a>, none of which indicated a genetic predisposition for breast cancer.</p>



<p>"I wanted to do extra testing so my daughter and son would have that information," says Melissa. She's now taking the hormone-blocking cancer medication and continuing her recovery.</p>



<p>"Everyone on my care team — Jessica, Amanda, Dr. Hanna, my surgeons and everyone else — has been so great," she says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>To celebrate her progress, Melissa threw out the first pitch at Cancer Survivors Night, sponsored by Mayo Clinic Health System, at a recent Mankato MoonDogs baseball game.</p>



<p>"This was my first outing since my surgery, and it was so fun and inspiring. I just hoped I'd throw a good pitch," says Melissa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Continuing to advance, refine mammograms</h2>



<p>Amanda is proud of her role in helping detect Melissa's breast cancer — and that of her other patients.</p>



<p>"I've always wanted to learn and do new things with mammography," she says.</p>



<p>She is particularly excited about new 3T MRI equipment in Owatonna, which will allow for MRI biopsies and more advanced imaging.</p>



<p>"This equipment will provide more support for breast procedures," she says. "And more patients will be able to stay close to home for first-rate care without traveling to Mayo Clinic in Rochester."</p>



<p>Melissa adds that her experience is a good example of why it's important for doctors and others working in healthcare to take women's health concerns seriously and provide them with options for preventive health scans and healthcare.</p>



<p>"If I didn't have a provider who listened and came up with a breast MRI to screen for breast cancer, we wouldn't have found it this early," she says.</p>

<p>You might think a dermatologist is going to ask you to ban the sun.</p>



<p>"There's nothing wrong with being outside in the sun," says Dr. Davis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UV, or ultraviolet light, is a carcinogen. That's where sunscreen helps.</p>



<p>"Sunscreen can act as a carcinogen barrier to help keep your skin safe," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>Keep these sunscreen facts in mind when you're reaching for your favorite bottle:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sunscreen can expire, affecting the active ingredient and the preservative.</li>



<li>Sunscreen is sensitive to extreme temperatures. Keep it out of direct sun, and don't let it freeze during winter storage.</li>



<li>People of color need to wear sunscreen.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bottom line, everyone over age 6 months needs sunscreen — babies included.</p>

<p>"It is a layman's myth that children do not get skin cancer. And it's a layman's myth that a person of color cannot have skin cancer," Dr. Davis says.</p>



<p>And lastly, Dr. Davis says, "There literally is no such thing as a waterproof sunscreen."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apply sunscreen, and after you get wet, reapply.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sunscreen application tips</h3>



<p>To be effective, sunscreen needs to be used liberally so be generous with your portions.</p>



<p>It's recommended to use&nbsp;1 ounce (30 milliliters) of sunscreen — the amount in a shot glass — to cover exposed parts of the body. You might need to apply more, depending on your body size. If you have a 4-ounce (118-milliliter) bottle, you'll use about a quarter of it during one application.</p>

<p>Today in the U.S., 7.2 % of adults identify as LGBTQ+ — that's more than 24 million people who often face stigma and discrimination that can make navigating the healthcare system difficult.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/cathcart-rake-elizabeth-j-m-d/bio-20558812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Cathcart-Rake, M.D.</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;medical oncologist specializing in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>, wants to change that. She's launched the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, to support the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, gender diverse and intersex (LGBTQ+) people with or at risk for breast cancer. She is also researching how to improve their cancer care experiences and outcomes.</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center Blog team spoke with Dr. Cathcart-Rake about the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic. Here's what she wants people to know about the clinic and the LGBTQ+ cancer care experience:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meeting the unique needs of LGBTQ+ people</h2>



<p>People who identify as LGBTQ+ experience significant disparities in cancer care, including higher rates of late-stage diagnoses, poorer cancer outcomes, and side effects from therapy that go unaddressed.</p>



<p>"I am interviewing folks who talk about getting surgeries on their nose and having their surgical team not feel comfortable getting them dressed after surgery because of their gender identity and gender expression. These types of experiences, to me, are heartbreaking," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<p>Dr. Cathcart-Rake says LGBTQ+ people are less likely to be offered fertility preservation before cancer treatment and often have unaddressed sexual side effects from treatment. For transgender and gender-diverse people, she says there are questions and concerns about the interaction between hormone therapy, gender-affirming and cancer-specific surgeries.</p>



<p>Opening the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic is personal for Dr. Cathcart-Rake. "I have a dear friend who came out and experienced unbelievable discrimination and stigma. That experience has fueled this — thinking through what they've gone through every step of the way. Our role is to care for the person in front of us, no matter what."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Offering cancer care services in a supportive, affirming environment</h2>



<p>The Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic team provides specialty, multidisciplinary and person-affirming care for LGBTQ+ individuals in a safe and respectful environment while optimizing physical, emotional and social health.</p>



<p>"At every point on their cancer care journey, we want patients to see clinic staff who are excited and happy to see them and know the affirming, culturally appropriate language to use. To support that environment, we have posted LGBTQ–welcoming signage throughout the clinic, wear rainbow pins on our badges, and offer gender-neutral bathrooms," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<p>The team includes Dr. Cathcart-Rake and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/tevaarwerk-amye-j-m-d/bio-20527633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amye Tevaarwerk, M.D.</a>, another medical oncologist specializing in breast cancer. Jamie Carroll, a nurse practitioner; Gina Schultz, a registered nurse; and Nicole Sintler, a social worker, are also on the team. All team members are trained in providing care for LGBTQ+ people. The team also consults with a breast surgeon and a radiation oncologist with similar training.</p>



<p>"LGBTQ+ people experience so much discrimination and stigma — in everyday life and healthcare experiences. They deserve spaces like this where they're welcomed and supported and receive equitable healthcare," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake. "We hope this is just a starting point, and we can expand to other cancer types and subspecialties."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting research to improve cancer care for LGBTQ+ people</h2>



<p>Dr. Cathcart-Rake says research is needed to help healthcare professionals understand the cancer care disparities LGBTQ+ people experience. "We know there are inequities and aspects of their cancer care we're not addressing. But there's little data to better understand those needs and how we can improve outcomes," she says.</p>



<p>Research will be central to the Rainbow Breast Cancer Clinic's purpose. "That's going to be a huge part of this clinic — to better understand and identify LGBTQ+ peoples' needs and work collaboratively with patients and advocates to address them," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<p>Patients will be asked to complete surveys about their care experiences and symptoms to support this research. Information from these surveys will be used to continuously improve clinical care and to develop clinical trials focused on the needs of LGBTQ+ people related to breast cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to make an appointment</h2>



<p>Housed on the 10th Floor of the Gonda Building on Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minnesota, the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic is open to anyone who wishes to be seen in an LGBTQ–focused breast clinic.</p>



<p>To make an appointment, call the Medical Oncology Appointment Office in Rochester, Minnesota, at 507-284-8815 and mention "Rainbows."</p>



<p>Virtual visits will be allowed for any patient, as laws allow.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A generous $20 million gift from Dwight and Dian Diercks will fuel key elements of Mayo Clinic’s vision for the future of healthcare, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform</a> and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for early detection and intervention in cancer. In honor of their support, Mayo Clinic will establish the Dwight and Dian Diercks President, Mayo Clinic Platform, and create the Heidi Diercks Krause Fund in AI Innovation for Cancer, named in honor of Mr. Diercks’ late sister.</p>



<p>"The Dierckses’ visionary investment will bolster Mayo Clinic’s efforts through the Platform to curate the world's de-identified data, empower solution developers and transform healthcare around the world," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/our-team/john-d-halamka-md-ms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Halamka, M.D.</a>, the inaugural Dwight and Dian Diercks President, Mayo Clinic Platform.</p>



<p>“Through the reach of Mayo Clinic Platform, the Dierckses’ remarkable generosity will accelerate new innovations that fundamentally change how health systems and care teams provide care to improve patients' lives,” says Dr. Halamka, who also holds the Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President’s Strategic Initiative Professorship.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Platform is a key focus of Mayo Clinic’s Bold. Forward. strategy to transform healthcare globally. Disrupting the traditional pipeline paradigm, Mayo Clinic Platform brings together solution developers, data partners and healthcare organizations to collaborate around secure, de-identified clinical data to create, validate and scale digital health solutions. It currently offers access to a diverse dataset of 46 million de-identified and longitudinal patient records, AI model validation for accuracy and removal of bias, and streamlined clinical integration. This transformative model is expediting a new era of revolutionary diagnostics and treatments that redefine the frontiers of patient care and well-being.</p>



<p>The Heidi Diercks Krause Fund in AI Innovation for Cancer will enable Mayo Clinic’s Generative Artificial Intelligence Program and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> to advance answers for cancer. An example of this work includes developing advanced generative AI tools to gain deep insights into a person’s risk of developing cancer. This forecasting will allow clinicians to intervene earlier than ever before — even before cancer can be diagnosed.</p>



<p>“We are profoundly grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Diercks for their support, which will help us bring the promise of AI to patients at the earliest phases of their care journeys,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/callstrom-matthew-r-m-d-ph-d/bio-00085927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Callstrom, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic’s medical director for Strategy, chair of Radiology in Rochester and leader of the Generative Artificial Intelligence Program. “Cancer affects people from all walks of life, and leveraging AI to tackle and treat this devastating disease will be critical for improving outcomes for all patients.”</p>



<p>As senior vice president of software engineering at NVIDIA, Mr. Diercks has been involved in AI innovation since the company’s inception.</p>



<p>“We can't afford to wait years or decades for new AI breakthroughs in healthcare. People need new therapies and cures now,” says Mr. Diercks. “Dian and I truly believe that Mayo Clinic Platform and AI innovation will be the keys to better predicting diseases like cancer, so physicians can intervene sooner with more effective treatments that save, extend or improve the quality of patient lives. It gives me comfort knowing my sister’s legacy will live on through these efforts to transform cancer care for everyone. Heidi lived for her family, and having additional time with her husband, Scott, and daughter, Kate, meant the world to her.&nbsp;In the future, we hope that extension of time can be amplified tenfold for others.”</p>



<p>Mr. Diercks grew up in Red Wing, Minnesota, less than 50 miles from Mayo Clinic’s Rochester campus, where he worked on his family’s farm as a teenager. His close family, including his late father and sister, trusted Mayo Clinic for their most complex health needs.</p>



<p>“I tell my friends that receiving care at Mayo Clinic is like being at the intersection of medicine and hardcore engineering. Everyone is focused on finding the right tests and data to solve the most personal, important health challenges in your life,” says Mr. Diercks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. Diercks earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering with a minor in business from the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). The Dierckses have provided transformational support to MSOE that has resulted in a nation-leading computer science program in applied AI and supercomputing. With their latest gift to Mayo Clinic, they aim to provide the same accelerant to AI innovation, now within healthcare.</p>

<p>Black people are more likely to die from prostate, lung and breast cancer than other races. Dr. Barbel Johnson says there are many contributing factors, including genetics, habits and other mitigating circumstances.</p>



<p>"It has a lot to do with the structural racism that has created the environment, not only for access but for prioritizing and evolving treatments," says Dr. Barbel Johnson.</p>



<p>The family medicine physician says regular cancer screenings are key to increasing survival rates.</p>



<p>"It's important that we prioritize those things where we're seeing the incidence and the death rates are highest in these populations to be screened for those conditions," says Dr. Barbel Johnson.</p>



<p>Knowing your family history, regular exercise and eating a healthy diet are also crucial to cutting cancer risks.</p>



<p>"In doing so, we will then decrease things like red meat, increase things like vegetables within our diet, decrease the amounts of sugar and artificial sweeteners that we have in our diet," she says.</p>



<p>She also recommends stopping tobacco use and getting adequate sleep.</p>
