<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Researchers from the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> are set to present key research findings, including two late-breaking abstracts, during the 2024 <a href="https://conferences.asco.org/am/attend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting</a> in Chicago May 31-June 4. These studies shed light on critical aspects of cancer treatment and management. Below are the highlights:</p>



<p><strong>The impact of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) omission in estrogen receptor (ER)-low (1%-10%) early-stage breast cancer</strong> (<a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/233537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abstract: 513</a>)</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Presenter:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/choong-grace-m-m-d/bio-20549783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grace Choong, M.D.</a>, medical oncologist</li>



<li><strong>Key Insight:</strong> In patients with ER-low breast cancer, omission of AET in patients treated with chemotherapy is associated with a 25% higher risk of death than those who receive AET. The impact of AET omission was most pronounced in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, AET should be recommended in patients with ER-low breast cancer until further studies can be performed.</li>



<li><strong>Day and Time</strong>: May 31, 3:15–3:21 p.m. CDT</li>



<li><strong>Location:</strong> E451 |&nbsp;On Demand</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Final results of a phase 2 study of tucatinib and trastuzumab for HER2-positive mCRC (MOUNTAINEER) </strong>(<a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/231646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abstract: 3509</a>)</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Senior Author</strong>: <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/bekaii-saab-tanios-s-m-d/bio-20396570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanios Bekaii-Saab, M.D.</a>, medical oncologist</li>



<li><strong>Key Insight</strong>: This presentation includes the final analysis of the MOUNTAINEER trial and reaffirms the clinically meaningful anti-tumor activity and favorable tolerability of tucatinib plus trastuzumab, a chemotherapy-free treatment option for patients with HER2+ mCRC, the first regimen to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication.</li>



<li><strong>Day and Time</strong>: June 3, 1:15–1:21 p.m. CDT</li>



<li><strong>Location</strong>: Arie Crown Theater |&nbsp;Live Stream</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Phase 3 randomized trial of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) versus intensity-modulated photon therapy (IMRT) for the treatment of head and neck oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC)</strong> (<a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/234877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abstract: 6006</a>) &nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Senior Author</strong>: Robert Foote, M.D., radiation oncologist</li>



<li><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is non-inferior to intensity modulated-photon therapy (IMRT) as measured by progression-free survival at three years and has emerged as a standard of care chemoradiotherapy treatment for oropharyngeal cancer. More patients treated with IMPT maintained their weight and fewer required gastrostomy tubes compared to patients treated with IMRT. IMPT is recommended for oropharyngeal cancer because it minimizes radiation to important organs while effectively treating the cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Day and Time:</strong> June 4, 11:45–11:57 a.m. CDT</li>



<li><strong>Location:</strong> S100a |&nbsp;Live Stream</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Key insights</strong>: The abstract becomes available at the time of the presentation. &nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Day and Time</strong>: June 2, 9:12–9:24 a.m. CDT</li>



<li><strong>Location: </strong>S100a |&nbsp;Live Stream</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Late-breaking abstract: Primary outcomes of the enhanced, EHR-facilitated cancer symptom control (E2C2) cluster-randomized, stepped wedge, pragmatic trial</strong> (Abstract: <a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/232437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LBA12006</a>)</p>

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Brain cancer is difficult to treat when it starts growing, and a prevalent type, known as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioma</a>, has a poor five-year survival rate. In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318843121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study</a> published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mayo Clinic researchers report on a new surgical platform used during surgery that informs critical decision-making about tumor treatment within minutes. Time is of the utmost importance when dealing with aggressive malignant tumors.</p>



<p>The platform uses mass spectrometry to identify a key gene mutation in brain cancer, known as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, in real time. Mass spectrometry is a sensitive technique used to analyze substances in tissue samples, including those altered in cancer.</p>



<p>The study involved more than 240 small tissue biopsies from patients undergoing asleep and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/awake-brain-surgery/about/pac-20384913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awake brain surgery</a> for suspected glioma at Mayo Clinic between 2021 and 2023, and an additional 137 biopsies from an international collaborator. Neurosurgeons collected biopsy samples from the core of the tumor to identify the mutations, as well as from areas around it, to assess if the tumor had spread.</p>



<p>Each tissue sample was placed on a glass slide steps away from the patients during ongoing surgery. The samples were analyzed through the mass spectrometer, which allowed researchers to rapidly assess — within two minutes — whether an IDH mutation was present.</p>



<p>The researchers say that, in addition to enabling real-time diagnosis, the platform allows surgeons to determine a patient's prognosis and perform tumor resection to improve patient outcomes. In the future, the new platform will help surgeons take advantage of the window of opportunity in the operating room to tailor treatment to the molecular features of a tumor, a more personalized approach to medicine.</p>



<p>Researchers hope new therapies developed to target IDH mutations can be delivered in the operating room at the time of surgery.</p>

<p>"The ability to identify this mutation during brain surgery means that one day in the future we may be able to treat patients with this specific mutation locally before they leave the operating room," says the study's senior author, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/quinones-hinojosa-alfredo-m-d/bio-20247553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa, M.D.</a>, dean of research and chair of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/neurosurgery/home/orc-20117096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Neurosurgery</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>"Therefore, we will be able to bring the fight against cancer to the operating room, before chemotherapy and radiation treatments begin, and before the disease has progressed and invaded further." Dr. Quiñones-Hinojosa is also director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/brain-tumor-stem-cell-research/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brain Tumor Stem Cell Research Laboratory</a>.</p>



<p>In the study, researchers were able to diagnose IDH gene mutations with 100% accuracy. They are conducting more research to find other signatures in tumors where the&nbsp;mutation is absent. In addition, they plan to broaden their discoveries to include other types of brain cancers.</p>



<p>This study was supported in part by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under award number R33CA240181.

<p><em><strong>Editors note: </strong> May 31 is World No Tobacco Day</em></p>

<p>Smoked tobacco has the strongest association with cancer, and it goes beyond cigarettes.</p>



<p>"Hookah, which is a smoked and inhaled tobacco, has a similar cancer risk because it's the process of smoking and inhaling those 7,000 chemicals that increases the risk for cancer," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>There's no safe, or safer, way to consume tobacco. A common misconception is that cigars are less harmful than cigarettes.</p>



<p>"All the same risks that you get with cigars that you inhale are exactly the same risks you have with conventional cigarettes," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>He says even cigar users, who tend not to inhale, are still at risk.</p>



<p>"If you smoke a cigar and just hold it in your mouth and exhale, all the tissues in your mouth that are exposed to the cigar smoke have an increased risk for cancer," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Head and neck cancers are more common in people who smoke cigars as well as those who use smokeless tobacco, which is also associated with pancreatic and kidney cancer.</p>



<p>"With electronic cigarettes specifically, we don't have enough longitudinal data to know whether those products are associated strongly with cancer," says Dr. Ebbert. "But we do know that those products result in the release of carbonyls and heavy metals. And those are known, theoretically, to lead to cancer."</p>



<p>No Tobacco Day is recognized this year on May 31 to inform the public of the dangers of using tobacco. All forms of tobacco consumption carry significant health risks and can lead to cancer.</p>



<p>"We always say it's never too late to stop smoking, and the risk for cancer after quitting cigarette smoking, for example, goes down. But it takes some time. So, if you think about reductions in cancer risk for lung cancer, in about 15 years, you have half the risk of cancer that you would if you had continued to smoke. So it takes some time, but it's never too late to stop smoking," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>

<p>"Both basal and squamous cell carcinoma are often slow-growing skin cancers. They're both caused mostly by the sun," says Dr. Costello.</p>



<p>These cancers are predominantly found on sun-exposed areas, like the face, scalp, neck and ears.</p>



<p>Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal, or a slightly transparent bump on the skin.</p>

<p>"For basal cells, they're often a pink bump that slowly enlarges with time. And sometimes they can bleed and be a little tender," Dr. Costello says.</p>

<p>Squamous cell carcinoma may look like a skin-colored bump and can start anywhere on the skin. It’s typically found on sun-exposed areas in sunburn-prone people. However, in those with darker skin tones, it can appear on sun-protected areas, including the genitals or toes.</p>



<p>"Sometimes they can get painful and ulcerated or be almost like a nonhealing wound," he says.</p>



<p>Early diagnosis and treatment for these nonmelanoma cancers are crucial. See a dermatologist if you notice spots changing or growing.</p>



<p>"The majority of the time both basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma are treated with&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-treating-skin-cancer-with-mohs-surgery/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mohs surgery</a>, particularly when it's on the face, scalp and neck," Dr. Costello says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reduce your risk of skin cancer </h2>



<p>Use sunscreen daily to help prevent exposure to dangerous ultraviolet rays.</p>



<ul>
<li>Wear sunscreen of at least 30 SPF.</li>



<li>Perform regular skin self-exams.</li>



<li>See a healthcare professional for abnormal growths or warts.</li>



<li>Wear protective clothing.</li>

<p>"Sunburns can be very painful," explains Dr. Tollefson. They can be a setup for infection if they're fairly severe."</p>



<p>While sunburns are thought to be short-term concerns, there are also long-term risks to sun exposure.</p>



<p>"The more UV exposure a child gets — especially the younger in life that it starts — and the more sunburns they have, the higher their risk for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20377605?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skin cancer</a> later in life," says Dr. Tollefson.</p>



<p>Sun protection in the first 20 years of life is the most crucial for protecting against long-term skin cancer risk.</p>



<p>For infants, it's best to avoid peak sun hours from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. If that's not possible, cover the baby with shade or long-sleeved clothing and a hat.</p>



<p>Dr. Tollefson also recommends using sunscreen on areas of exposed skin.</p>



<p>"We would recommend that, at that age, parents use the sunscreens that have physical blockers rather than chemical blockers because they're better for sensitive skin," she says.</p>



<p>Look for these ingredients when selecting a sunscreen for baby:</p>



<ul>
<li>Titanium dioxide</li>



<li>Zinc oxide</li>
</ul>



<p>Remember to reapply sunscreen every two hours or right after swimming or sweating.</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note: </strong>May is Bladder Cancer Awareness Month.</em></p>



<p>Just 10 years ago, people with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bladder cancer</a> whose cancer had not spread and didn't respond to treatment often required bladder removal, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/tyson-mark-d-ii-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20206454" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Tyson, II, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center urologic surgeon. "Now, we have a whole host of new drugs and clinical trials that allow us to offer more options," he says. Many of these options provide effective treatment while preserving the bladder. And clinical trials can provide additional options.</p>



<p>Most bladder cancers are urothelial carcinomas, which begin in the urothelial cells lining the inside of your bladder. Most are also non-muscle-invasive, meaning they have not spread beyond the bladder's muscle wall. While treatment depends on cancer type, grade, stage, the patient's overall health and other factors, Dr. Tyson says "We are, hopefully, going to be able to keep the disease at bay for the vast majority of people."</p>



<p>Dr. Tyson talks about new and developing bladder cancer treatments and what you should know when seeking bladder cancer care:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Individualized treatments and improved techniques are producing better outcomes</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Newly approved drug combination</h3>



<p>In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/bladder-cancer-padcev-keytruda-doubles-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two-drug combination</a>&nbsp;of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab (EV/pembro) to treat locally advanced or metastatic urothelial bladder cancer. The combination was previously only approved for the significant number of people who were ineligible for first-line treatment with a type of chemotherapy called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cisplatin-intravenous-route/description/drg-20062953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cisplatin</a>.</p>



<p>"Clinical trial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onclive.com/view/frontline-enfortumab-vedotin-plus-pembrolizumab-elicits-os-improvement-in-advanced-urothelial-carcinoma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">results</a>&nbsp;showed that EV/pembro was better than cisplatin and cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in the first-line setting," says Dr. Tyson. Study results also highlighted a 55% reduction in disease progression or death compared to treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, making EV/pembro the first treatment for urothelial bladder cancer to outperform chemotherapy when used as a first-line treatment.</p>



<p>"EV/pembro is now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/bladder-cancer-padcev-keytruda-doubles-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new standard of care</a>&nbsp;for patients with metastatic urothelial bladder cancer," says Dr. Tyson.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Single-port cystectomy (bladder removal surgery)</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cystectomy/about/pac-20385108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cystectomy</a>&nbsp;(bladder removal) might be recommended for muscle-invasive bladder cancer and for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer that hasn't responded to other treatments or is likely to spread. It can be done with one large incision or several small incisions using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/minimally-invasive-surgery/about/pac-20384771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minimally invasive surgery</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Tyson says Mayo Clinic is leading the way in refining a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7214961/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-incision robotic surgery</a>&nbsp;for bladder removal and reconstruction. This method shows potential for less pain, fewer postoperative complications and shorter hospital stays, although more research needs to be conducted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clinical trials testing new immunotherapy and less-invasive surveillance</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Immunotherapy for treatment-resistant non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer</h3>



<p>Immunotherapy, a drug treatment that helps your immune system fight cancer, is sometimes used to prevent the recurrence of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, especially when bladder preservation is a priority. A current standard-of-care immunotherapy is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/bcg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)</a>, a vaccine that uses weakened bacteria to stimulate the immune system to kill remaining cancer cells in the bladder. For high-grade, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer that's unresponsive to BCG, a new immunotherapy called cretostimogene grenadenorepvec is on the fast track for FDA approval, says Dr. Tyson. Mayo Clinic is participating in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/cancer-clinical-trials/about-cancer-clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phase 3</a>&nbsp;clinical trial testing cretostimogene grenadenorepvec.</p>



<p>"We presented&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onclive.com/view/fda-grants-fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-designations-to-cretostimogene-grenadenorepvec-for-nmibc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a>&nbsp;at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association in 2024 showing promising results from a study conducted in patients with BCG-unresponsive, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer," says Dr. Tyson. "As part of the trial, it's administered once a week for six weeks, and it's well tolerated, so patients don't have many side effects. Then we reassess them for three months, and if they've had a good response, they go on maintenance cretostimogene for three, six, nine, 12 and 18 months." Preliminary study results showed that out of 112 people who had completed the treatment course, 75.2% had a complete response, meaning that their cancer had not recurred. Eighty-three percent of complete responders who had one year of follow-up maintained their complete response beyond one year.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Urine test for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer recurrence monitoring</h3>



<p>Because bladder cancer has a high recurrence rate and can progress from non-muscle-invasive to muscle-invasive disease during treatment, surveillance is important. Post-treatment monitoring often involves&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cystoscopy/about/pac-20393694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cystoscopy</a>, a procedure where a scope is inserted through the urethra — the tube that carries urine out of your bladder — to examine the inside of your bladder.</p>



<p>Intravesical therapy, chemotherapy given directly into the bladder through a tube passed through the urethra, is an option for people with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. "Patients undergoing intravesical therapy generally need surveillance cystoscopy every three to six months for a couple of years, every six months for a couple of years, and yearly thereafter," says Dr. Tyson.</p>



<p>Cystoscopies can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful, and Dr. Tyson says a less-invasive surveillance method might become an option for people after non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer treatment. "One of the exciting studies we're doing at Mayo Clinic uses a urinary biomarker from a urine sample to identify recurrence without the need for cystoscopy," he says. The study aims to learn about people's preferences, comfort level and confidence in the urine test compared to cystoscopy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/bladder-cancer-illustration-16x9-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-388420" style="width:741px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/bladder-cancer-illustration-16x9-1.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/bladder-cancer-illustration-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding the most effective bladder cancer treatment for you</h2>



<p>Choosing bladder cancer treatment is a personal decision. There are many factors to consider, including bladder preservation and quality of life. Dr. Tyson says it's important to find an attentive care team that treats a high volume of people with bladder cancer and has expertise in different surgical approaches to treatment.</p>



<p>"Try to find a healthcare professional willing to spend time with you to answer your questions," says Dr. Tyson. "If you feel rushed, that's not a good thing. If you feel like your care team isn't talking to you about all the options available, you're not getting a good opinion." He says learning about and considering all the treatment options is especially important if you want to preserve your bladder.</p>



<p>Dr. Tyson also recommends talking to your healthcare team about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/search-results?keyword=BLADDER%20CANCER&amp;studySiteStatusesGrouped=Open/Status%20Unknown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bladder cancer clinical trials</a>, which might be beneficial if your cancer continues to advance after treatment. "People should look for care at centers that offer clinical trials, especially if they have non-muscle-invasive disease. Clinical trials are a good opportunity to get next-generation therapies."</p>



<p>Bladder cancer treatment and survival have improved drastically over the last decade. Dr. Tyson wants people with bladder cancer to know they have more options than ever before.</p>



<p>"If you have non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, you're unlikely to die from your disease, and it's becoming more unlikely that you will lose your bladder," he says. "For muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the landscape has totally changed with EV/pembro. There's a lot of reason for hope. There's a lot of reason to think you can beat this disease."</p>

<p>Stomach cancer is caused by an uncontrolled growth of cells that starts in the stomach. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease has spread beyond the stomach, when a cure is less likely.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic experts are exploring new ways to help patients with late-stage cancers. A new approach to treating <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stomach-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stomach cancers</a> called hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) delivers heated liquid chemotherapy directly to the abdomen where it can target the cancer. In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grotz-travis-e-m-d/bio-20342285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Travis Grotz</a>, a Mayo Clinic surgical oncologist, discusses how HIPEC works and the potential benefits of the treatment.</p>

<p>During a HIPEC treatment, the abdominal cavity is bathed with hot chemotherapy to kill any microscopic cancer cells.</p>



<p>"The chemo can stay locally in that region, the abdomen, and then it can continue to work even past the procedure. And then that allows us to use really high concentrations of the chemo directly where the cancer is," says Dr. Grotz.</p>



<p>HIPEC has been used as a treatment for other cancers for several decades, but just recently has been adapted to stomach cancer.</p>



<p>"We use the kind of a different combination of drugs that we've come up with based on other research and data and experience, and put them together and found that, in our experience, that they were more synergistic. They work together to kill the cancer cells very well. Our outcomes were quite a bit better than kind of traditional systemic chemotherapy," says Dr. Grotz.</p>



<p>The outcomes have been significantly better than those achieved with traditional chemotherapy. However, Dr. Grotz notes that more studies are ongoing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"We want to improve survival, help people live longer, spend more time with their family, do it in a way that's safer, and has less complications and risks to patients," says Dr. Grotz.</p>

<p>Cancer is a life-altering diagnosis requiring complex care that can last months, years and, for some people, the rest of their lives. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7666754/">Studies</a> show that people undergoing cancer treatment can spend as much as 10% of their time traveling to and from medical facilities and at appointments for therapies, lab work or scans.</p>



<p>Through collaboration and innovation, Mayo Clinic's Cancer Care Beyond Walls program is transforming care delivery to allow some patients to receive part of their cancer care from the comfort of their own homes while integrating digital technology and remote patient monitoring capabilities to improve clinical outcomes.</p>

<p>Cancer Care Beyond Walls is built upon Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hospital-at-home/sections/overview/ovc-20551797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advanced Care at Home</a> capabilities, which replicate hospital-quality care in a patient's home. Cancer Care Beyond Walls has built upon these capabilities to create a new paradigm for outpatients that allows the care team to administer chemotherapy, perform lab draws and conduct telehealth appointments in the patient's home — addressing barriers to care, including financial constraints, time limitations or travel ability.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dronca-roxana-s-m-d/bio-20055312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Roxana Dronca</a>, a medical oncologist and the site deputy director of Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Florida, explains Cancer Care Beyond Walls is changing how patients navigate their care.</p>



<p>"Cancer Care Beyond Walls gives more people access to cancer care and to clinical trials no matter where they live, reducing the financial and time burden on patients and their families and improving quality of life," says Dr. Dronca. "Providing cancer care in the home for people who are part of this program allows other people with cancer the opportunity to receive treatment in the clinic because more infusion chairs and beds are now available. The program is also designed to reduce a participant’s number of visits to the emergency room through symptom assessment and prompt management."</p>



<p>Maria Holmes, a retired business owner living in Jacksonville, Florida, spends her day on the move. She saw Cancer Care Beyond Walls as an opportunity to stay engaged with activities she enjoys and people she loves.</p>



<p>"I'm able to be with my sister," says Maria. "It is just such a convenience that I could go off and check my time, and say, 'OK, my nurse is going to be here at 9 a.m.,' pop in, get my chemotherapy infusion, and then go back out and continue my walk."</p>



<p>The program allows Bart Tragemann to miss fewer days as an elementary school physical education instructor.</p>



<p>"This program of getting your chemotherapy at home has changed my life," says Bart. "It frees up my time and allows me to do things that I never thought I would be able to do again. My quality of life has changed significantly to a point where I never thought I'd be."</p>



<p>Bart's wife, Erin Tragemann, says treatments at home allow them to spend time with family and make plans that previously had to be arranged around visits to medical facilities.</p>



<p>"Being on this path that we're on right now — being stable right here at home and able to do all the things that we've been talking about doing and going to do them, looking forward to things and going to plan vacations and futures — it's just exciting and wonderful," says Erin.</p>



<p>For Dr. Dronca, the mission of Cancer Care Beyond Walls is personal.</p>



<p>"My daughter, my seemingly healthy 6-year-old daughter, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor in 2020," says Dr. Dronca. "As an oncologist, I was convinced that we can do more. As a mom, I would have given everything, even if a few blood tests were done at home, and we would not have to travel. Even if 1 in 5 infusions were done in the home, we would not have to go through all this."</p>



<p>Dr. Dronca hopes the program will yield an improved quality of life for people with cancer and their families.</p>



<p>"After my personal experience and after my daughter losing her battle with this disease, I'm even more determined that I will fight it with everything I can," says Dr. Dronca. "I will fight it by changing the way we deliver care and making it more comfortable for our patients, and I won't stop until we cure cancer."</p>

<p>A cancer diagnosis is an emotional experience. Learning that you have cancer can create feelings of hopelessness, fear and sadness. This is especially true if your cancer is advanced or available treatments are unable to stop or slow its growth.</p>



<p>"Often, when patients are diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>, they feel hopeless and scared. Clinical trials are one way patients can be proactive. They can make a choice in how their care is going to be," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist.</p>



<p>Cancer clinical trials help physician-scientists test new and better ways to control and treat cancer. During a clinical trial, participants receive specific interventions, and researchers determine if those interventions are safe and effective. Interventions studied in clinical trials might be new cancer drugs or new combinations of drugs, new medical procedures, new surgical techniques or devices, new ways to use existing treatments, and lifestyle or behavior changes.</p>



<p>Clinical trials provide access to potential treatments under investigation, giving options to people who otherwise may face limited choices. "Clinical trials open the door to a new hope that maybe we can fight their cancer back and give them a better quality of life," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/johnson-geoffrey-b-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geoffrey Johnson, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiologist, nuclear medicine specialist and co-chair of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;Experimental and Novel Therapeutics Disease Group.</p>



<p>You will receive cancer treatment if you participate in a clinical trial. "I think one common misperception about clinical trials is that if you enter a clinical trial, you may not get treatment (receive a placebo). And that's actually very much not true. Most clinical trials are looking at one treatment compared to another treatment," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/boughey-judy-c-m-d/bio-00027350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judy C. Boughey, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic surgical oncologist, chair of Breast and Melanoma Surgical Oncology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and chair of the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center Breast Cancer Disease Group.</p>

Block, Johnson and Boughey discuss the importance of clinical trials in cancer care:</strong></p>

<p>Clinical trials are a significant part of cancer care at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. Cancer care teams work together across specialties to make sure the right clinical trials are available to serve the needs of people with cancer who come to Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"We are very particular in how we select the clinical trials that we have available for patients," says Dr. Boughey. "We want to have the best trials available for our patients. Some of the clinical trials are evaluating drugs — we are so excited about those drugs, but we can't prescribe those drugs for patients without having that trial. And so we will actually fight to try to get that trial open here to have it available as an opportunity for our patients."</p>



<p>If you choose to participate in a clinical trial, you will continue to receive cancer care. "For most patients that we evaluate, there's always the standard of care treatment option for those patients. And then, in many situations, there's also a clinical trial that the patient can participate in," says Dr. Boughey.</p>



<p>People who participate in clinical trials help make new and better cancer care available for future patients. The treatments available for cancer patients today exist because of the clinical trial participants of yesterday. "We couldn't advance medicine if it wasn't for people volunteering for trials. And the promise from our side is to say we're not going to put patients on trials or offer trials for them to consider unless we think there's a good chance that they'll get a benefit or that society at large will get a benefit," says Dr. Johnson.</p>

<cite>GEOFFREY JOHNSON, M.D., PH.D.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Participating in a clinical trial may give you access to cutting-edge treatment, improve your quality of life and extend your time with loved ones.</p>



<p>"It's definitely worth reaching out to your healthcare provider and asking, 'What clinical trials could I be a potential candidate for?'" says Dr. Boughey. "And remember, you can ask this of your surgical oncologist, your medical oncologist, your radiation oncologist, or any of the physicians you're seeing because there are trials in all disciplines. There are also ongoing trials that require the collection of tissue or the donation of blood. They can also be important in trying to help future generations as we continue to work to end cancer."</p>

<p>Clinical trials can be a beacon of hope for many patients and can fuel the discovery of new advancements in healthcare. They represent the power of collaboration between volunteer participants and research teams who carefully collect data.</p>



<p>One clinical trials team at Mayo Clinic is working to test a screening tool for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a>, a leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.</p>



<p>Early detection of colorectal cancer may hold the key to saving lives.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20467318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voyage study</a>, the team is gathering real-world data on Cologuard, a noninvasive stool DNA screening test for colorectal cancer, and now has 150,000 participants enrolled. The participants will be tracked over a seven-year period.</p>



<p>The team conducting this study includes data librarians, statisticians and clinical research coordinators, who ensure the research is thorough and conducted responsibly. The team has worked in lockstep throughout the trial, now in its fifth year.</p>



<p>"The purpose of this study is to gather real-world evidence on Cologuard's impact on long-term outcomes in a large, diverse population, and so the overarching goal is to examine the colorectal cancer-related incidence and mortality in a cohort of people who had an order for the test kit," says clinical research coordinator Allison Berry.</p>



<p>"It is a prospective survey-based study, so we're looking at people going forward in time," she adds.</p>



<p>The participants enrolled in the study answered a baseline questionnaire about demographics and their health history. From there, Berry says, the team is building a data repository that documents any changes in their health or personal information over time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Labor of love</strong></h2>



<p>The team notes that this study is a labor of love.</p>



<p>"People send us notes all the time; one person said they are doing this because their mother passed away, and they do not want anyone to go through this pain," says Berry. "I think just seeing the care, attention and investment that participants have makes our job rewarding."</p>



<p>The team notes that the work being conducted today within the study has implications for now and well into the future when it comes to those considering preventive measures such as early screening for colorectal cancer. They hope the data points they are collecting will provide lifesaving information and result in positive outcomes for patients.</p>



<p>"We're not just collecting data and keeping it," says clinical research coordinator Angie Kostreba. "We're concentrating on following up and continuing to validate what the participants have reported by checking in with their healthcare providers."</p>



<p>Senior program coordinator Jessica O’Neill emphasized that the effort put into the details of the clinical trial makes all the difference.</p>



<p>"When people hear about survey studies, they don't realize how much work goes into it," says O'Neill. "The research coordinators have fielded over 24,000 phone calls, 6,000 voicemails, 10,000 emails, 500,000 incoming documents and one million mailed outgoing documents."</p>



<p>The clinical research coordinators are critical to the work, their colleagues say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The clinical research coordinators have played a hugely important role in the success of the Voyage study,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/olson-janet-e-ph-d/bio-00027660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Janet Olson, Ph.D.</a>, the study's principal investigator. "As advocates for the study and the participants, the study coordinator team has been well prepared to ensure that all tasks were done with quality and integrity and that participants received timely responses to their inquiries about the study."</p>



<p>Members say that flexibility and cohesive team dynamics also are key to ensuring the study's success.</p>



<p>"We would not be here without everyone who helped get us to this point," says clinical research coordinator Jen Fondakowski. "We've been lucky to have such a phenomenal team for many years."</p>
