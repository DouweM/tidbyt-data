<p><strong><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (2:11) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/SCRIPT-Using-proton-beam-therapy-on-the-heart-PKG.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></strong></p>



<p>When Roger Thomsen had his first episode several years ago, the 69-year-old retired repairman felt lightheaded. He checked his pulse. His heart rate was around 200 beats per minute. A typical pulse is 60 to 100.</p>



<p>"I told the wife, I said, 'I think we need to go to the doctor,'" Roger says.</p>



<p>Roger soon learned he has a heart condition called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ventricular-tachycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355138?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ventricular tachycardia</a>, also called V-tach or VT.</p>



<p>"Ventricular tachycardia is an abnormal rapid rhythm arising from the bottom chambers of the heart that can cause significant symptoms to patients," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/siontis-konstantinos-m-d/bio-20503925?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Konstantinos Siontis</a>, a Mayo Clinic electrophysiologist.</p>



<p>It can even be fatal. Essentially a short circuit caused by scar tissue on the heart, a common treatment for V-tach is a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ventricular-tachycardia-ablation/pyc-20385006?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">catheter ablation</a>. Doctors enter the heart through blood vessels using a catheter to create tiny scars with heat energy and block the irregular signals. Roger had several of these complex ablations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The symptoms came back. I was in the hospital a couple two, three times after that," Roger says.</p>



<p>So a couple of years ago, Roger enrolled in a clinical trial at Mayo Clinic. He would be one of the first of a handful of patients with V-tach to have a precise form of radiation typically used in cancer treatments, called proton beam therapy, used on the heart.</p>



<p>"Got nothing to lose. And the way it was, it wasn't working good," Roger says.</p>



<p>"Proton beam is a unique type of radiation that's actually a charged particle. It's able to deliver the energy of radiation at a specific depth or target in tissue without any exit dose beyond," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merrell-kenneth-w-m-d/bio-20434012">Dr. Kenneth Merrell</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist.</p>



<p>"With catheter ablation, there are certain areas within the heart that can be difficult to access," says Dr. Siontis.</p>



<p>And unlike a catheter ablation, proton beam therapy is completely noninvasive.</p>



<p>"The patient does not require anesthesia. They can walk into the treatment area and walk out the same day within about 30 minutes to an hour of completing the treatment," says Dr. Siontis.</p>



<p>It's nearly a year since Roger has had an abnormally rapid heart rhythm. </p>



<p>"It made it so it was working," Roger says. Which is the type of result the research team at Mayo says could bring new hope for some patients with V-tach.</p>



<p>"This was an encouraging first step," says Dr. Siontis. </p>



<p>While more study is needed, researchers are excited for the future. "Most likely, this will be another tool in the tool belt for us to use in patients," says Dr. Merrell.</p>



<p>The full results of the clinical trial using proton beam therapy to treat VT have yet to be published. The team at Mayo plans to present them later this year.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart failure during pregnancy is a dangerous and often under-detected condition because common symptoms – shortness of breath, extreme fatigue and trouble breathing while lying down – are easily mistaken for typical pregnancy discomforts. Late-breaking research presented at the <a href="https://esc365.escardio.org/ESC-Congress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Society of Cardiology Congress</a> on a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> study showed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital stethoscope helped doctors identify twice as many cases of heart failure compared to a control group that received usual obstetric care and screening. Full <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03243-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study findings are published in Nature Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>The trial was conducted in Nigeria, where more women experience pregnancy-related heart failure than anywhere in the world. The results also indicate that screening including the AI-enabled digital stethoscope were 12-times more likely than traditional screening to flag heart pump weakness when evaluated at an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/expert-answers/ejection-fraction/faq-20058286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ejection fraction</a> threshold lower than 45%, which is the cutoff indicating a specific type of heart failure called <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiomyopathy/what-is-cardiomyopathy-in-adults/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-ppcm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peripartum cardiomyopathy</a>.</p>



<p>"Recognizing this type of heart failure early is important to the mother's health and well-being," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20507418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demilade Adedinsewo, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and lead investigator of the study. "The symptoms of peripartum cardiomyopathy can get progressively worse as pregnancy advances, or more commonly following childbirth, and can endanger the mother's life if her heart becomes too weak. Medicines can help when the condition is identified but severe cases may require intensive care, a mechanical heart pump, or sometimes a heart transplant, if not controlled with medical therapy."</p>



<p>The randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial included nearly 1,200 participants who were screened for heart conditions through typical obstetric care or AI-enhanced solutions. Mayo Clinic researchers previously developed a foundational 12-lead AI-electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm to predict a weak heart pump, clinically known as low ejection fraction. A version of this algorithm was further enhanced by Eko Health for its point-of-care digital stethoscope which is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared to detect heart failure with low ejection fraction.</p>



<p>The researchers found that doctors using AI-based screening with the digital stethoscope and 12-lead ECG detected weak heart function with high accuracy. Within the study cohort, the digital stethoscope helped flag twice as many cases of low ejection fraction &lt;50% and doctors using it were 12-times more likely to identify an ejection fraction &lt;45% as compared to usual care.</p>



<p>The AI-supported tools were evaluated at three different levels of ejection fraction used in clinical diagnosis. Less than 45% is the cut point for diagnosing peripartum cardiomyopathy. Less than 40% indicates heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and has strong evidence in favor of specific medications to reduce symptoms and the risk of death. An ejection fraction of less than 35% signals severely low heart pump function that often requires more intense management, including advanced heart failure therapies and an implantable defibrillator if pump function does not recover. Patients in the intervention group each had an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a> at study entry to provide confirmation of the AI-predictions.</p>



<p>"This study provides evidence that we can better detect peripartum cardiomyopathy among women in Nigeria. However, there are more questions to be answered," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "Our next steps would be to evaluate usability and adoption of this tool by Nigerian healthcare providers (including doctors and nurses) and importantly, its impact on patient care. Peripartum cardiomyopathy affects approximately 1 in 2,000 women within the U.S. and as many as 1 in 700 African American women. Evaluating this AI tool in the U.S. will further test its abilities in varied populations and healthcare settings."</p>



<p>Funding for this clinical trial includes Mayo Clinic (Centers for Digital Health and Community Health and Engagement Research), the Mayo Clinic Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women’s Health (<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/womens-health-research-center/education/building-interdisciplinary-research-careers-womens-health-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BIRCWH</a>) Program funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Mayo Clinic’s Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences (<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CCATS</a>) funded by the NIH.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers are using artificial intelligence (AI) with an advanced 3D body-volume scanner – originally developed for the clothing industry – to help doctors predict metabolic syndrome risk and severity. The combination of tools offers doctors a more precise alternative to other measures of disease risk like body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio, according to findings published in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ehjdh?login=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Heart Journal - Digital Health</a>.</p>



<p>Metabolic syndrome can lead to heart attack, stroke and other serious health issues and affects over a third of the U.S. population and a quarter of people globally. The condition lacks widely accepted screening strategies. However, researchers found that using a 3D body volume scanner combined with imaging technology and Mayo Clinic-developed algorithms may help clinicians offer a more accurate method for identifying people who have the syndrome, as well as those at risk for developing it.</p>



<p>The effects of metabolic disease create hardship for patients. In addition to heart attack and stroke, people with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, cognitive disease and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver disease</a>. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed clinically when at least three of these five conditions are present: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high fasting blood sugar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"There is a need for a reliable, repeatable measure of metabolic syndrome risk and severity," says Betsy Medina Inojosa, M.D., a research fellow at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. "Body mass index measurements and bioimpedance scales that measure body fat and muscle are inaccurate for many people, and other types of scans are not widely available. Our research shows that this AI model may also be a tool to guide clinicians and patients to take action and seek outcomes that are a better fit for their metabolic health."</p>



<p>To develop the tool, researchers trained and validated an AI model on 1,280 volunteer subjects who underwent an evaluation that included 3D body-volume scans, standardized clinical questionnaires, blood tests and traditional body shape measurements. An extra 133 volunteers had front- and side-view images taken via a mobile app from Select Research called myBVI to further test the tool's ability to evaluate whether they had metabolic syndrome, and if so, how severe it was.</p>



<p>People with metabolic syndrome typically have apple-shaped bodies, meaning they carry a lot of their weight around the abdomen. The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome revolves around laboratory tests, blood pressure and body shape measurements, but there are no widely accepted routine screening strategies because these measurements are not always available or reproducible in the same way. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"This small study finds that digitally measuring a patient's body volume index with 3D imaging provides a highly accurate measurement of shapes and volumes in critical regions where unhealthy visceral fat is deposited, such as the abdomen and chest," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, director of Preventive Cardiology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and senior author of the study. "The scans also record the volume of hips, buttocks and legs – a measure related to muscle mass and 'healthy' fat. The 3D information about body volume in these key regions, whether from the large, stationary 3D scanner or from the mobile app, accurately flagged the presence and severity of metabolic syndrome using imaging instead of invasive tests. Looking ahead, the next steps will be to broaden the sample of research subjects to include more diversity."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic and the researchers have a financial interest in the technology referenced in this press release. Mayo Clinic will use any revenue it receives to support its not-for-profit mission in patient care, education and research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our primary care colleagues spend a lot of time with their patients dealing with their blood pressure, and their cholesterol and their arthritis, sleep apnea, and urinary incontinence and diabetes," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>She says it's important to step back to look at what these health issues have in common.</p>



<p>"What kind of unites all of those things? It's obesity," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is obesity?</h2>



<p>"There are many ways of defining obesity, but ultimately, it's a condition of excess adiposity – too many fat cells," explains Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>And carrying extra weight increases your risk of certain hormonal cancers such as breast and endometrial cancer.</p>



<p>"It is also a risk factor for certain GI cancers, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer&nbsp;—&nbsp;numerous cancers. And we don't always know why but the link between obesity and cancers is clear," Dr. Shah says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;As obesity rates increase, the reasons are not always clear-cut.</p>

<p>Active workstations incorporating a walking pad, bike, stepper and/or standing desk are successful strategies for reducing sedentary time and improving mental cognition at work without reducing job performance, according to a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-finds-active-workstations-may-improve-cognitive-performance/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>. But you don't need to spend money on new office equipment to achieve the benefits of an active workstation.</p>

<p>Sitting at a desk for hours at a time may make some feel exhausted and unmotivated. If that's ever happened to you, it may be time for a snack … an activity snack.</p>



<p>The concept is simple, after sitting for an hour, take two to three minutes to get up and move your body.</p>



<p>"You break this sedentary status of your body by going to take the stairs for two or three flights, or just do some push-ups or do something that is meaningful in terms of activity for just a few minutes, and then come back and continue your work," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>In a way, Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says those two to three minutes reset your metabolic clock.</p>



<p>"It has been impressive, the biological changes those activity snacks can induce in your cells, in the metabolism of the sugar, in the metabolism of the cholesterol, just by having those little episodes of activity, even though you might be sitting down for the next 45 minutes," he says.</p>



<p>It's a small change that can make a big impact on your physical and mental health.</p>



<p>"You will see how that little thing will even sharpen your mind for the next half an hour, 45 minutes, absolutely," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Cardiologists in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/heart-rhythm-clinic/overview/ovc-20442477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart Rhythm Clinic</a> are using a new innovative energy source to safely and successfully treat a common type of heart arrhythmia. The therapy, called pulsed field ablation (PFA), has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and represents a significant milestone in treating <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a> (AFib).</p>



<p>The irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm of AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart, increasing a patient's risk of stroke. Clinicians can use medication and therapies to help reset the heart rhythm, but some patients have AFib that persists and worsens. Ablation therapy has been used for about two decades to treat these patients, but pulsed field ablation uses a different approach.</p>



<p>Instead of applying heat or cold energy as in traditional ablation, the PFA catheter therapy uses short bursts of high energy called irreversible electroporation to affect heart tissue that causes atrial fibrillation. The PFA therapy successfully transitioned to patient care at Mayo Clinic in Rochester in February 2024. Mayo cardiac specialists have since used PFA to treat more than 200 patients for AFib.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Limitations inspired development of new energy sources</h2>



<p>"The traditional approaches using thermal energy sources to treat AFib — radiofrequency, laser, cryo energy — all carry an associated injury risk to nearby structures, the esophagus and the phrenic nerve," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kapa-suraj-m-d/bio-20055752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suraj Kapa, M.D.</a>, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PFA technology has been in development for more than 18 years. Mayo Clinic's pioneering research in ablative therapy began under another cardiac electrophysiologist and prolific inventor, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/asirvatham-samuel-j-m-d/bio-20053066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel J. Asirvatham, M.D.</a> He had a growing interest in developing novel energy sources that would allow for cardiac-selective impact.</p>



<p>"The principle underlying PFA is that, depending on the makeup of the cell membranes of different types of tissues, certain tissue may have different energy thresholds that may be 'deadened' or ablated while other tissue types may be preserved," says Dr. Kapa. "Research through hundreds of preclinical trials has suggested that PFA of the heart tissue can allow for a heart tissue-specific approach to ablation while avoiding collateral injury to structures such as the esophagus or the phrenic nerve."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research led to the development of two recently U.S.-approved systems to deliver pulsed field energy to the heart. Dr. Kapa notes that both catheters are approved to treat AFib in the form of pulmonary vein isolation and have shown similar efficacy in clinical trials when compared with traditional radiofrequency ablation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of pulsed field ablation</h2>



<p>PFA can lead to faster procedures while reducing anesthesia time and removing some of the risks of traditional AFib ablation.</p>



<p>"Minimizing risk and making potentially effective treatments more broadly available is critical to providing therapy to the largest number of patients," says Dr. Kapa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is estimated that 12.1 million people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AFib by 2030 — more than double the number in 2010. Globally, the number of patients diagnosed with AFib is increasing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"A growing body of evidence supports more aggressive rhythm control with ablation, whether earlier in a patient's AFib diagnosis to achieve better long-term outcomes or in the setting of other comorbidities such as heart failure, in which ablation has shown to reduce mortality," says Dr. Kapa.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Assessing how PFA may be used for other arrhythmias, such as ventricular arrhythmias, is in the works. Early preclinical data suggest that PFA may be superior to current traditional thermal energy-based approaches in this arena. Looking ahead, Dr. Kapa anticipates rapid growth and evolution in pulsed field therapy.</p>



<p>"Within the next year, we expect the introduction of at least a half dozen catheters and systems utilizing pulsed field therapy, each offering new research opportunities and the potential to provide transformative, curative care for patients with arrhythmic diseases."&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Mayo Clinic Healthcare expert explains what it means – and what to do with the information</em><strong></strong></p>



<p>LONDON — Wearables measure several aspects of health, and heart rate variability might be one of those. It may be surprising when your device informs you that your heart rate variability is high or low, but what does it mean? <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/doctors/elijah-r-behr-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elijah Behr, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare</a> in London, explains heart rate variability and how it factors into health.</p>



<p><strong>What does heart rate variability measure?</strong></p>



<p>“It measures the balance of nerve activity in the body and the way it relates to your heart rate and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/blood-pressure/art-20050982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a>,” Dr. Behr explains.</p>



<p>The nerve system that heart rate variability relates to is called the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/autonomic-neurology-subspecialty-group/overview/ovc-20443607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autonomic nervous system</a>. It can be thought of as the balance between the effects of adrenaline in the body and the other part of the nervous system, the vagus nerve, Dr. Behr adds.</p>



<p>“From beat to beat, or over periods of time, heart rate variability can be measured in different ways to try to assess this balance within the autonomic nervous system,” he says.</p>



<p><strong>What does high or low heart rate variability mean?</strong></p>



<p>“In general people who have higher heart rate variability are more likely to have better cardiovascular fitness. Athletes tend to have a very high heart rate variability, for instance,” Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p>People with lower heart rate variability may be likelier to lack cardiovascular fitness or to have underlying heart disease, he explains. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Does this mean people with high heart rate variability have nothing to worry about, and those with low heart rate variability should be concerned?</strong></p>



<p>For people who haven’t been diagnosed with a heart condition and are otherwise healthy, heart rate variability alone isn’t information that a doctor can act upon, Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p>“Heart rate variability by itself isn’t likely to give you a good view of your likelihood of say, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest</a> or other <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas/arrhythmia-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart rhythm</a> problems. It doesn’t provide enough detail to say, `Yes, you’re at heightened risk of X,’” he says.  </p>



<p>Research on heart rate variability in patients who have had heart attacks has not been incorporated as yet into clinical decision making about them, such as treating someone more aggressively, Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p><strong>Can you improve your heart rate variability?</strong></p>



<p>“One could say to a patient that you need to exercise more, lose a bit of weight, get fitter. But these are things that would be promoted for heart health generally,” Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p><strong>Advice for patients worried about their heart rate variability:</strong></p>



<p>“Ignore it as a stand-alone measure. Do use it as a way of pushing you toward being a bit healthier in your lifestyle,” Dr. Behr advises. “Watch blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, exercise; if you’re worried about your heart rate variability, you should be worried about these. They are more tangible risks that can be acted upon and that we know will have an impact on your longevity.”</p>

<p>Could a short diet questionnaire encourage patients to make better food choices and improve heart health? In the past, your healthcare team had to rely on lengthy surveys to better understand what you were eating. But that's all changed with the <a href="https://minieat.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mini-EAT assessment tool</a>.</p>

<p>Eating habits play a significant role in your health. So how much and what kinds of foods do you eat in a week? Healthcare professionals often ask these questions during an exam, which can sometimes be tedious.</p>



<p>"Very extensive surveys of 110 questions or 120 questions pretty much asking you about every single food you had," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic simplified the process by creating the Mini-EAT assessment tool. It consists of nine dietary-specific questions and takes about two minutes to complete.</p>



<p>"When the person is telling you that he's eating fruits and vegetables every day and avoiding fast food, you know just by having those responses that that person very likely is doing the right thing," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>Being mindful of your diet could help prevent heart disease and high blood pressure.</p>



<p>"Blood pressure might be affected by the quality of our foods, and cholesterol too, which we know leads to heart disease," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>With the Mini-EATS tool, healthcare professionals will be able to give patients more accurate, individualized information so they can make healthier nutritional choices.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:10) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/SCRIPT-MCM-Skipping-Breakfast-SCRIPT-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"Skipping breakfast, historically, hasn't been something necessarily healthy," Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says.</p>



<p>He adds that missing the first meal of the day isn't good for your heart.</p>



<p>"There are numerous studies showing that people who skip breakfast have an increased risk for heart disease and many other ailments," he says.</p>



<p>Not only that, there's also some evidence to suggest that heart attacks are more likely to happen in the morning.</p>



<p>"Part of it is the high adrenaline state that occurs early in the morning. If you match that with no food, no calories at all, what happens is that the body says, 'Well, with no food, I could die from starvation, so I have to do some extra things.' And those extra things are basically crunching the glands that make adrenaline. And essentially, the body gets into this rush of adrenaline," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>And for those wanting to lose weight through fasting, breakfast is not the right meal to miss.</p>



<p>"People who skip breakfast, many times they're able to do that because they have a pretty large dinner," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez. "So you're feeding the body with calories at the time when your body is just about to go to sleep, when you need calories the least."</p>
