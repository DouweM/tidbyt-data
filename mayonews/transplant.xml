<p><strong><em>Editor's note: The following was written and submitted by David Bradshaw</em></strong>. <strong><em>He shares his journey from COVID, to transplant to gratitude for a second wind, including the part Mayo played in his journey.</em></strong></p>



<p>Imagine sailing through life for 68 years — the picture of good health — without major illness, disease or hospital visits. That was my life ... until <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a> hit me in January 2021. What seemed like a bad case of flu morphed into <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary fibrosis</a> lung disease — a sure death sentence, I thought, within two to four years.</p>



<p>My breathing became increasingly difficult. I required an oxygen tank with any exertion at all, even a short walk to the mailbox. I went from swimming 500 meters three times a week to a couch potato overnight. For months, I desperately hoped my case of COVID-19 might improve.</p>



<p>As I struggled to make sense of this new reality, I met with a local pulmonologist in Sarasota, Florida, who promptly referred me to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida</a>. Within a week, I had hope. Mayo reached out with the news that I might be a candidate for a double-lung transplant. Four weeks later, I drove 220 miles to begin the arduous transplant approval process.</p>



<p>Upon arrival, I marveled at Mayo's ultramodern campus and relaxing interiors. Even more refreshing was the patient-centered culture that pervades the entire Mayo team — from front door valets to the nurses, doctors and surgeons — like a finely tuned engine hitting on all cylinders. I was able to stay at the Gabriel House of Care on campus, featured in the 2020 movie "2 Hearts," which is available to accommodate patients and families before, during and after a transplant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The royal treatment and miracles</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>I spent 14 days in Jacksonville. My schedule was filled with lots of testing to determine if I was healthy enough for a transplant. It may be hard to imagine, but there was little or no waiting time for more than 40 appointments! I felt like I was treated like royalty during this time. As someone who loves music and creating, this model of efficiency later inspired me so much that I ended up writing and recording a song, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbKAkWgs5EE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mayo Royal Treatment<em>.</em></a>"</p>



<p>All of the pre-transplant care at Mayo Clinic was great, especially <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/narula-tathagat-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20305908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. (Tathagat) Narula</a> who convinced me that a transplant was my only viable option. After all the testing at Mayo, I was put on the UNOS list at both Mayo Clinic and Tampa General, due to its closer proximity to Sarasota.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="587" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw2-1024x587.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-377901" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw2-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw2-300x172.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw2-768x440.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw2.jpg 1075w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>On April 12, 2022, I received the OK to be placed on the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lung-transplant/about/pac-20384754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a> list, although I was told it would likely take months, a year or even longer to find my new lungs. Yet, within days, the miracles began.</p>



<p>Miracle 1: Just four days after being put on the transplant list, I received a phone call at 10 p.m. requesting I immediately come to the hospital (Tampa General Hospital) for transplant surgery. A matching set of lungs had been found! The urgency of taking this life-changing step of faith confronted me head-on as I, of course, said, "Yes!"</p>



<p>Miracle 2: After the surgery, my surgeon explained the various difficulties he had encountered. The normal time for this remarkable procedure is six to eight hours, but in my case, it lasted for 18 hours. During the surgery, I had flatlined for almost three minutes! Thankfully, I was resuscitated in time, to my family's relief.</p>



<p>Asked about what I had experienced during those three minutes, I explained that I was aware of a change of consciousness, despite the anesthesia, yet felt no fear. I experienced a unique sense of several things, including love, peace and safety. When my surgeon stopped by the next day, I asked him, "Did I die?" His response was classic, "Not on my watch!" He truly is my hero!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="226" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw5-226x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-377902" style="width:243px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw5-226x300.jpg 226w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw5-771x1024.jpg 771w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw5-768x1020.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw5.jpg 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" /></figure></div>


<p>Within days, I began exercising my new heaven-sent lungs. Thanks to the prodding of my tough-loving post-transplant team, I was soon back to eating, drinking normally and up on my feet using a walker. What joy to finally be able to breathe again without supplemental oxygen! I was released from the hospital 18 days later on June 4, 2022.</p>



<p>Ever since, I have followed the doctor's strict orders regarding medications, diet and exercise to ensure that these precious new lungs last as long as possible. I wrote the donor family a thank-you letter expressing my gratefulness. And, of course, being impressed by the selfless gift, I recorded them a song, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y1j9OmfHXo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Can I Say Thanks?</a>"</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thanksgiving every day!</strong></h2>



<p>The road to recovery over the past 18 months has been long but amazing. I don’t know how I can ever express my thanks to everyone who helped me — all the doctors, nurses, technicians, assistants, as well as my family, friends and, most of all, my donor.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw1-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-377899" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw1.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></figure></div>


<p>Today I'm walking 2–4 miles a day, swimming laps again and biking. To celebrate my one-year anniversary, I had a custom T-shirt made as a visible expression of my gratitude.</p>



<p>As a retired writer, I wrote my own autobiography and now feel called to teach a writing class at a local Sarasota college. I also serve as a hospice volunteer and prison minister.</p>



<p>In between all my <em>activities</em>, I love spending time with my family, which includes four daughters, 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren — all born in the last year!</p>



<p>Following my transplant, I also began volunteering as a <a href="https://unos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing</a> ambassador to speak about the ever-growing need for new organ donors. Did you know that you can be a living organ donor? Many people do not realize this is an option.</p>



<p>During this season of Thanksgiving, my enthusiasm for life overflows. I am so thankful to Mayo Clinic that I've been given a "second wind!" Because Mayo serves, it leads. Serving is my way of giving thanks.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic is celebrating 60 years of helping patients receive the gift of life through organ transplants. Over the past six decades, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> has remained at the forefront of research and cutting-edge innovation which is revolutionizing the world of organ transplant.</p>



<p>Tens of thousands of people are on organ transplant waiting lists in the US. The wait can take years. </p>



<p>There is hope.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Innovation is transforming how organ transplants are performed, helping more people get the lifesaving organs they need. A special kidney perfusion pump can help preserve a donor organ, often giving transplant teams a critical edge in the race against the clock.</p>



<p>The pump helped Christopher Leslie get his new kidney. Now he's got his health back and is fulfilling his dream of teaching his daughter about their Native American heritage.</p>

<p>Doctors told Christopher he would need a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a>. While waiting for a donor kidney, he had to begin dialysis. </p>



<p>What gave Christopher, a single father, the strength to fight for his life? </p>



<p>"My daughter," said Christopher pausing between words. "I'm trying not to cry, I'm sorry. I've seen people die on dialysis. And I thought, you know, that could be me. I never wanted that for my kids."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organ transplant - Every second matters</h3>



<p>There are approximately 100,000 in the US on the kidney transplant waiting list. The wait can take years. The minute an organ becomes available, it is a race against the clock to get the donor organ to the recipient as quickly as possible. Each second the donor organ is outside the body, it can start to break down. </p>



<p>Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/reddy-kunam-s-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20054489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kunam Reddy</a> says he aims to do a kidney transplant within 24 hours of the organ becoming available. In Christopher's case, unexpected delays in the organ allocation process meant the transplant team would need more time. Doctors placed the donor kidney on a special pump that uses hypothermic perfusion technology, an advanced cold pulsatile organ perfusion system. The system helps maintain the viability and function of the organ between the point of retrieval from the donor and transplant into the recipient.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="718" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Kidney-transporter-1024x718.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-377814" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Kidney-transporter-1024x718.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Kidney-transporter-300x210.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Kidney-transporter-768x539.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Kidney-transporter-1536x1077.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Kidney-transporter-2048x1437.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>The pump holding Christopher's kidney prior to transplant using hypothermic perfusion technology</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>Christopher's kidney was held on the pump for nearly 45 hours, one of the longest times Dr. Reddy says he has seen in 30 years. Christopher's transplant was declared a complete success. "He had primary (kidney) function working right away," said Dr. Reddy. "He didn't have to have dialysis at all post-transplant."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting warmer</h2>



<p>One of the latest advances in organ perfusion technology is known as normothermic perfusion. Instead of cold storage, normothermic perfusion uses a warm system. It is not yet being used for kidneys, but it is being used in liver and cardiac transplant. The technology is commonly referred to as "liver-in-a-box" and "heart-in-a box." This is where the donated organ is kept at a warmer temperature that mimics the human body. The organ is also kept alive while being pumped with nutrient-rich blood. This helps minimize organ tissue breakdown, and allows doctors to monitor the organ at all times during transport.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gratitude, Goodwill, and Generosity</h2>



<p>"So many advances have been made over the past many years. All of the work, what we do, the generosity of the donors, their families, the gift of life, the goodwill and the generosity, that's what makes this a very exciting field for me," said Dr. Reddy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Seeing both sides, the donor family, how gratified they are in finding something meaningful out of a hopeless situation.

<p>Charlotte Markle, 81, is among the world's longest-surviving <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> recipients. Her transplant at Mayo Clinic was over 57 years ago on March 2, 1966.</p>



<p>It followed Mayo Clinic's first kidney transplant on Nov. 25, 1963, which was Mayo's first solid organ transplant of any kind. Charlotte is Mayo's longest-surviving transplant recipient.</p>



<p>She attributes her place in medical history to her loved ones and her care team.</p>



<p>"I thank my husband and my family and the doctors that I had," says Charlotte, who is from Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. "Without them, I wouldn't be doing as well as I am."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transplant innovation begins</strong></h2>



<p>Marking its 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary this month, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a> is the largest integrated transplant center in the U.S. Mayo's program includes transplant practices at its campuses in Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; and Phoenix. Since the program began, Mayo Clinic has performed more than 31,000 solid organ transplants.</p>



<p>"What started at Mayo Clinic in Rochester in 1963 has become a world-renowned transplant program," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burcin Taner, M.D.</a>, director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Florida.</p>



<p>In October, Mayo Clinic performed its first minimally invasive, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-surgeons-perform-first-robotic-assisted-kidney-transplant-in-minnesota/">robotic-assisted kidney transplant</a>, which also was the first one performed in Minnesota.</p>



<p>These medical bookends, six decades apart, mark significant steps in transplant innovation, says<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heimbach-julie-k-m-d/bio-20054676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Julie Heimbach, M.D.</a>,&nbsp;director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Minnesota.</p>



<p>"It reflects the spirit of innovation and of recognizing serious and complex disease and how Mayo can contribute to moving the field forward," Dr. Heimbach says.</p>

<p>In 1963, options to care for people with kidney failure were few. Access to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hemodialysis/about/pac-20384824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hemodialysis</a>, which can replace kidney function temporarily, was limited. Kidney transplantation was a clinical research option in its infancy in the U.S., following the first successful kidney transplant between identical twins performed in Boston in 1954 by a team that <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)62883-8/fulltext#:~:text=American%20physician%20Joseph%20Edward%20Murray,transplantation%20occurred%20between%20identical%20twins." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately was awarded a Nobel Prize</a>.</p>



<p>Anti-rejection medication to keep the transplant recipient's immune system from attacking the donated organ was in its early stages but necessary for all transplant recipients except identical twins.</p>



<p>"There were just remarkable hurdles that needed to be overcome," Dr. Heimbach says. "Even very young people were dying of kidney failure. It was one surgical and medical innovation on top of another that allowed this progress to be made."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'My only option was a transplant'</strong></h2>



<p>Tired. That's how Charlotte, a Waukesha, Wisconsin, native, remembers feeling in her youth. But she recalls serious health problems striking almost overnight in her early 20s. Nausea led Charlotte, a newlywed at the time, to believe she may be pregnant. Before she could see her physician, she began having convulsions. Her local doctors could not determine her problem, and she was flown to Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Her Mayo team ultimately diagnosed irreversible chronic kidney failure.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqsnI_PBKRI&amp;t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidney function</a> is necessary to live. These two bean-shaped organs remove waste from the blood by producing urine. They also play a role in controlling blood pressure, fluid balance, red blood cell counts, metabolic balance and bone health. Each healthy kidney is about the size of a person's fist. They sit in the abdomen along each side of the spine.</p>



<p>Living well with one healthy kidney is possible; that fact makes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-transplant/about/pac-20384787#:~:text=The%20match%20is%20based%20on,transplant%20center%20policy%20allows%20it." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living kidney donation</a> an option.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Dialysis to clear waste from the blood is a treatment for kidney failure, preceding transplant, but Charlotte had difficulty tolerating those treatments. "My only option was a transplant," she says.</p>



<p>While a kidney transplant was rare in 1966, so was a patient airplane transfer between medical centers. "Nothing was common back then," Charlotte says with a chuckle.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-transplant/care-at-mayo-clinic/pcc-20384790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donor testing</a> of healthy and willing candidates to identify a matching blood and tissue type for the needy transplant recipient was also in its early stages in the 1960s. One of Charlotte's five older brothers, Roland, was identified as her living donor candidate, and Charlotte recalls learning, "We were about as close to being twins as we could be."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'She is an inspiration'</strong></h2>



<p>Thomas Schwab, M.D., a retired Mayo Clinic transplant nephrologist, was in eighth grade when Charlotte underwent her kidney transplant. By the time he joined the Mayo staff in 1986 and assumed some of her transplant care, Charlotte already had had her kidney for over 20 years.</p>



<p>"Charlotte's story and outcome is a true inspiration to our transplant teams and especially to those patients in need of a kidney transplant," he says.</p>



<p>Caring for Charlotte has been a privilege, says Dr. Schwab. "It's a reason to get up every morning if you can help patients have an outcome like Charlotte has had."</p>

<p>Charlotte has adhered faithfully to her anti-rejection drug regimen. "I do follow doctor's orders," she says. Any side effects from her medical program have been few, and her transplanted kidney function is remarkably normal for a donated kidney that is more than 90 years old, Dr. Schwab notes.</p>



<p>"A kidney transplant is not a sprint. It's a marathon. It requires paying attention to your health and following the program we recommend. But you're not out there alone. We have an entire team of doctors, nurse coordinators and surgeons that help along the way," Dr. Schwab says.</p>



<p>"Over the years, our record of steadily improving patient outcomes shows that research by Mayo Clinic and colleagues worldwide have developed a recipe for long-term success of our transplant patients."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pioneering medicine, then and now</strong></h2>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="224" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Hallenbeck_George_1968-224x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-377593" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Hallenbeck_George_1968-224x300.jpg 224w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Hallenbeck_George_1968-763x1024.jpg 763w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Hallenbeck_George_1968-768x1030.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Hallenbeck_George_1968-1145x1536.jpg 1145w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Hallenbeck_George_1968-1527x2048.jpg 1527w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">George Hallenbeck, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Schwab calls Charlotte a "transplant pioneer" who accepted an opportunity with many unknowns at the time — so was her surgeon, George Hallenbeck, M.D. He led the pioneering team who performed Mayo's first kidney transplant in 1963. Dr. Hallenbeck's innovative efforts were not limited to transplant medicine. He was part of the Mayo aeronautical research team that designed the antigravity suit, called the G-suit, a garment developed during World War II that pilots and astronauts wear to keep from blacking out during high acceleration force.</p>



<p>In the early days of kidney transplantation, living donor surgeries were sometimes more extensive than for recipients. Donor surgery required a lengthy incision around a third of the body, and sometimes a rib needed to be removed, Dr. Schwab explains.</p>



<p>Since 1999, living kidney donation surgery at Mayo has been performed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/donor-nephrectomy/about/pac-20384867#:~:text=In%20a%20laparoscopic%20nephrectomy%2C%20the,to%20remove%20the%20donor%20kidney." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laparoscopic technique</a>s, using smaller incisions to insert surgical instruments and a special camera to remove the donor's kidney. This minimally invasive approach shortens recovery and increases the rate of living kidney donation, which may be arranged in weeks to months compared with an average four- to six-year wait for a deceased donor kidney.</p>



<p>Even into the 1970s, many patients' kidney transplants did not survive one year. Today, one-year survival rates for kidney transplants are over 98%, making it the treatment of choice for patients with kidney failure who are eligible for surgery.</p>



<p>October's robotic-assisted kidney transplant was yet another Mayo milestone. While most kidney transplants are done via open surgery with a 4- to 8-inch incision on the lower abdomen, a robotic-assisted transplant allows the surgeon to make a significantly smaller incision using robotic instruments to complete the transplant, allowing shorter recovery time for the recipient.</p>



<p>Mayo also is focused on research and innovations to expand the kidney donation eligibility pool by helping organs from deceased donors remain viable longer while awaiting transplant. Medical research is being conducted to identify organ failure earlier to delay or prevent the need for a transplant. Mayo transplant experts are developing new practices to help organs last longer after transplantation. In the future, bioengineering of new organs may be possible.</p>



<p>"Our mission is that no patients should die awaiting transplant," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bashar Aqel, M.D.</a>, director of Mayo Clinic's Transplant Center in Arizona.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'I owe all that to Mayo Clinic'</strong></h2>



<p>Family and faith have comforted Charlotte during her kidney transplant journey. She recalls praying in the hospital chapel with her mother. "I'm just a strong believer that everything we were doing was the right thing and that everything would turn out," says Charlotte. "I owe all that to Mayo Clinic."</p>



<p>For Charlotte, it's hard to believe how far transplant medicine has come, including a surgeon controlling a robotic instrument to perform the procedure. "It's really something," she says. It pleases her to know that today's female transplant patients may consider pregnancy, which Charlotte and her husband, David, were advised against in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>



<p>Charlotte expresses deep gratitude for her good health during a more than 50-year marriage and a 40-year career as a hospital dietary aide. A widow, she enjoys time with her extended family and quilting and crafting with her sole surviving sibling, her sister, Sharon. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Emotion tugs at her voice when Charlotte speaks of Roland, who, years after donating a kidney, died awaiting a heart transplant. "My brother would be very proud of me," she says.</p>



<p>To future organ donors and recipients, Charlotte has a message: "I wish them all the best and good meaningful years like I have had."</p>

<p>"Our goal is to transform the transplant practice for future patients. To do that, we are using technology and team science to look at ways to optimize donated organs, liberate patients from anti-rejection medications and enable donated organs to last longer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burcin Taner, M.D.</a>, director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Florida.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is celebrating the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of its first organ transplant, which was a kidney transplant from a living donor on Nov. 25, 1963. Today, Mayo Clinic is the largest integrated transplant center in the U.S. Mayo Clinic's transplant centers in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota combined have performed over 31,000 organ transplants.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Here are four promising ways transplant is changing:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Enabling more donated organs to be safely used.</strong></h2>



<p>New technology is helping ensure that more donated organs can get to the people who desperately need them. One of the biggest advances has been organ-perfusion systems. These mechanical devices enable donated organs such as lungs, hearts, kidneys and livers to remain viable outside the body for a longer period of time so that they can be used. It also allows surgeons to restore organs that would otherwise not be safe for transplantation. "Organ perfusion technology has helped us expand the donor pool and deliver lifesaving transplants to more and more patients, all while maintaining some of the best outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bashar Aqel, M.D., </a>&nbsp;director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Helping transplants last longer.</strong></h2>



<p>The average kidney transplant in the U.S. lasts 10 to 20 years, meaning transplant recipients are often faced with needing a second transplant. But what if those donated organs could last longer? Researchers are looking at ways to keep patients healthier so that these donated organs thrive longer. For example, one of the most common causes of kidney failure is diabetes, which is related to obesity. One innovative approach is to perform bariatric surgery ahead of the kidney transplant to reduce the chance of post-transplant diabetes. Efforts are also underway to improve how organs are matched with patients with the goal of minimizing the need for immunosuppression medication, which can have negative side effects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Identifying organ failure earlier.</strong></h2>



<p>The quicker someone is identified as being at risk for organ failure, the sooner they can begin to receive treatment in hopes of delaying — and potentially preventing — the need for a transplant. Researchers are exploring ways to identify subtle warning signs that this is happening earlier via artificial intelligence and biomarkers in the blood.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Bioengineering new organs.</strong></h2>



<p>It may sound like science fiction, but experts hope that one day there will be a way to engineer new organs using <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative medicine</a>. That would eliminate the uncertainty of organ donation and long waiting lists. Those efforts are still in the early stages.</p>



<p>While all of these potential advances offer hope, choosing to be an organ donor is a step people can take today to help save more lives. More than 103,000 people are on the waiting list in the U.S. for a transplant, according to the <a href="https://unos.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing</a>. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/living-donor-transplantation/overview/ovc-20545462?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Living donation</a> allows people to donate a kidney or part of their liver to someone in need. People also can <a href="https://donatelife.net/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">register</a> to become a deceased donor.</p>

<p><em><strong>For her one-year anniversary, Luana Q., a Mayo Clinic patient, shares her liver transplant story. Luana was the 4,000<sup>th</sup> patient to receive a liver transplant since the program began at Mayo Clinic in Florida in 1998. For her transplant, the team used normothermic regional perfusion to preserve the donated organ. This innovative approach uses a machine to pass blood through organs in a donor's body after the heart has irreversibly stopped beating. The procedure also allows for a variety of therapeutic interventions, potentially enhancing the organ's quality before transplantation.</strong></em></p>



<p></p>



<p>On Oct. 22, 2022, I had my <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida. I live in New Smyrna Beach which is an hour and a half away from Jacksonville. I am so thankful for the donor who gave me the opportunity to continue to live a healthy life after my transplant.</p>



<p>I had <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver cancer</a> by the name of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This cancer developed from having <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-c/symptoms-causes/syc-20354278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hepatitis C</a> in prior years. Even though I went through the medical treatment of riboflavin and interferon for one year, and the treatment was successful (the hepatitis C was no longer detectable), we continued to monitor my bloodwork and liver biopsies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="296" height="640" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Luana-Quinette.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376503" style="aspect-ratio:0.4625;width:135px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Luana-Quinette.jpg 296w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Luana-Quinette-139x300.jpg 139w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /></figure></div>


<p>In 2016, during a routine exam, a lesion was discovered on my liver which turned out to be HCC liver cancer. My doctor made arrangements for me to go to Mayo for further care.</p>



<p>My tumor was larger than acceptable for me to be a transplant candidate; however, the Mayo team did not give up. I was given the opportunity to have Y90 radioembolization, where a special radiation specifically targeted the tumor on my liver to shrink it.</p>



<p>Prayers were answered and the tumor shrank, so I could be placed on the liver transplant list. I had to wait six months for my Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score to increase, which placed me in a position to be called sooner for a transplant.</p>



<p>On Sept. 23, 2022, I received "the call" to come to Mayo for a possible liver transplant, but, unfortunately, the organ donor's liver was unsuitable for transplant, and the surgery was canceled. That was disappointing, but I am glad my care team thoroughly examined the organ.</p>



<p>Soon after, I was called again on Oct. 22, 2022, and had a successful liver transplant. I was given the best team of doctors and nurses who gave me the most wonderful care. I remained in the hospital for four days and continued my stay at the Gabriel House for another four weeks so I could return to Mayo for follow-up monitoring.</p>



<p>I am so honored to be the 4,000th liver transplant patient and praise Mayo for all the lives they change by successfully caring for each patient and their needs. The teams really care, and I never felt like just a number as that sometimes happens. I truly love the care that I continue to receive.</p>



<p>I feel each day is a special gift, and I truly am thankful to Mayo Clinic and my organ donor. I thank God for his love and mercy for me, and giving me this wonderful gift.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> surgeons successfully performed Minnesota's first robotic-assisted kidney transplant earlier this month. This minimally invasive procedure may be beneficial for patients with a higher body mass index and may reduce the risk of incisional complications, such as hernia or infection.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's first robotic-assisted kidney transplant was successfully performed on Oct. 4 on a woman in her 60s who received a kidney from her daughter.</p>



<p>“Mayo Clinic has been a leader in the field of kidney transplants for six decades. We are proud to continue that tradition by completing the first robotic-assisted kidney transplant in Minnesota," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-timucin-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055648?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Timucin Taner, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, division chair of Transplant Surgery at Mayo Clinic. Dr. Taner and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dean-patrick-g-m-d/bio-20054709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Dean, M.D.</a>, performed the robotic-assisted surgery.</p>



<p>For patients with kidney failure, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> remains the best treatment available. Most kidney transplants are done via open surgery. The surgeon makes an incision 4- to 8-inches long on the right or left side of the lower abdomen to transplant the donated kidney. For a robotic-assisted kidney transplant, the surgeon makes a roughly 2-inch incision around the belly button and a smaller incision to insert the robotic instruments. The surgeon sits at a console that controls the surgical robot.</p>



<p>“A robotic-assisted kidney transplant requires a smaller incision. It lowers the risk that patients will experience complications, such as an infection or hernia. Patients may also have less discomfort and a speedier recovery, potentially meaning less time in the hospital after surgery," says Dr. Dean, surgical director of Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/kidney-transplant/sections/overview/ovc-20203202?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidney Transplant Program</a> in Minnesota.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality soundbites with Dr. Patrick Dean and patient Pam Panning are available in the downloads at the end of the post. </strong></p>



<p>For most patients, the traditional kidney surgery method remains the best option. It is safe and successful.</p>



<p>“Robotic-assisted kidney transplant will not replace open kidney transplantation entirely,” Dr. Taner says. “It will, however, offer another option for those who may benefit from an alternative incision site — especially those with higher body mass indexes, previous hernias or prior abdominal surgeries.”</p>

<p>In the U.S., <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17 people</a> die every day while waiting for an organ transplant.</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of people on <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=27#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of,percent%20of%20white%20living%20donors.">transplant waiting lists</a> come from minority communities, while about 30% of donors are people of color.</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/does-my-race-ethnicity-matter-in-organ-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood types</a> and certain HLA, or antibodies, tend to correlate with various ethnic groups," says Dr. Mao. "So it is not directly related to a particular minority group; however, organs will end up with someone of a similar background because the better matched an organ is, the more longevity that organ has."</p>



<p>Higher rates of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are present in minority communities, contributing to more organ failures.</p>



<p>"The more people we can help the sooner through transplant, the better," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>She says living donors do not experience a change in their quality of life after surgery, but a recipient's life can change for the better almost immediately.</p>



<p>"If somebody is approved to be a <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/process/living-donation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donor</a>, we expect they will live a full and normal life following their donation process," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>In most states, <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signing up</a> to be a donor after death can be done online or when registering for a driver's license or identification card. For a <a href="https://www.kidneyregistry.org/for-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donation</a>, contact the recipient's care team or a <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant center</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Today is National Navajo Code Talkers Day - a day to honor the group of U.S. Marines who created a secret code credited with helping the U.S. win World War II.</p>



<p>At 94 years old, Peter MacDonald Sr. is the youngest of three surviving Navajo code talkers in the world. </p>



<p>He visited Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona to share his defining chapter in American history. MacDonald also made a personal plea for improving access to high-quality healthcare for people in his homeland, which he hopes will be part of his legacy.</p>

<p><strong>Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network</strong>." <strong>Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/FINAL-PETER-MACDONALD-SR-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script.</a></strong></p>



<p>About 200 Mayo Clinic employees attended the special ceremony honoring National Navajo Code Talkers Day. Another 1,000 employees joined live online for the rare opportunity to step back in time and hear a firsthand account of events from the battlefields in 1942 that would shape American history. </p>



<p>MacDonald, now confined to a wheelchair, greeted the audience with a warm, energetic welcome and a touch of lightheartedness that brought chuckles to the crowd. If you want to keep a secret, MacDonald teased the crowd, "Just start talking to people in Navajo code," he said with a grin. "No one in the world will understand what you're talking about!"  </p>

<p>Before MacDonald began his story, he wanted to deliver a message. MacDonald asked the audience for their support in helping achieve health equity in Native American communities. "On the Navajo Reservation, we have so many health problems," explained MacDonald. He admitted that his efforts which began in the 1970s as chairman of the Navajo Nation to eliminate health disparities have fallen short. "I still feel that even today if you read the news, or watch TV, you know there are a lot of illnesses on Navajos, like diabetes," said MacDonald. "It's high as opposed to what's in the rest of the country."</p>

<p>MacDonald shared his own experience of receiving medical care at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota 50 years ago. He was inspired by Mayo Clinic's multidisciplinary approach to medical care. "The doctor asked me a lot of questions, and then had me see three other specialists," said MacDonald. "The next day I went back and he had all the reports in front of him. He said 'Ok, this is how we are going to take care of you.' I will never forget that. We need that kind of care on the Navajo Reservation."</p>

<p>MacDonald applauded recent efforts by Mayo Clinic to eliminate barriers to healthcare for people in Native American communities with its <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/breaking-barriers-helping-native-americans-in-need-get-the-gift-of-life/">new community outreach program</a>.  A year ago Silena Thomas began working as a Native American patient outreach navigator for Mayo Clinic. Silena was born and raised on the Navajo Nation in northern Arizona. Fluent in both English and Navajo, Silena works connecting American Indians and Alaskan Natives with lifesaving organ transplants at Mayo Clinic. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Growing up on the reservation with my mom and grandma, I was the only person that could speak both languages. So everywhere we went, I was the translator, especially at medical appointments."</p><cite>Silena Thomas, Patient community Outreach Navigator, American Indian and Alaskan Natives</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Thomas has helped dozens of people navigate the maze of getting an organ transplant. "Many of the people living on the reservation don't have a phone, computer, or Wi-Fi to make appointments. Also, a lot of people don't have transportation. I help patients organize all those details so it's not so overwhelming," said Thomas. "Because I can speak the language and I understand the culture, patients feel more comfortable. It feels like home. For me, it feels like I'm talking to my mom or my grandma." </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Robert's story</h2>



<p>Robert Monroe and his wife Jackie live in a remote area with their children and grandchildren on the Navajo Reservation. Their small trailer has no air conditioning, a wood-burning stove for heat, intermittent cellphone service, and is miles from high-quality healthcare. Five years doctors told Monroe he would need weekly dialysis for a failing kidney. It was an hourlong drive to the closest dialysis center. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>"Mosty of the time I just ended up hitchhiking to get to kidney dialysis."</em></p><cite>Robert Monroe, Resident Navajo Nation</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"It would take the whole day and I couldn't be there to take care of our home and our family," said Monroe. It is almost two years after Monroe's successful transplant. "I'm grateful to Silena, and the person who gave me this new kidney. I've been able to get back to work and take care of my family."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The top-secret classroom</h2>



<p>After MacDonald's plea for support for his homeland, he spent nearly an hour sharing a vivid account of how the code talkers used a secret code they created based on the complex, unwritten Navajo language.  MacDonald described the top-secret classroom surrounded by armed guards and razor wire where the group of 29 Navajo service members converged to create the code. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="609" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-14-at-12.05.22-PM-1024x609.png" alt="" class="wp-image-372916" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-14-at-12.05.22-PM-1024x609.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-14-at-12.05.22-PM-300x178.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-14-at-12.05.22-PM-768x457.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-14-at-12.05.22-PM.png 1422w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>"In that classroom, were tables with four chairs around each table. On the walls were huge blackboards with chalk and erasers," described MacDonald. "Now we're talking June of 1942. The Marine Corps Colonel looked at us and said 'Gentlemen of the United States Marines, are you ready to go fight a war in the Pacific? But before you do that, we would love for you to do something else first. We'd like for you to develop a military code using your own language.'"</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>"Are you ready to go fight a war in the Pacific? Before you do that, we would love for you to do something else first. We'd like for you to develop a military code using your own language."</em></p><cite>Peter MAcDonald recalls the order by the U.S. Military in 1942</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>By the beginning of July, with part of the code created, MacDonald said they were given the order to find out of the code would work. "We're going to stop here. We're going to test this code," remembers MacDonald describing the Colonel's words. "You must develop an actual battle to see how your memory works under enemy fire. You can't write anything down because if you get shot the enemy will search you and find messages in your pocket. We don't want that," adds MacDonald.</p>

<p>The code was never cracked by the enemy. Historians argue the Navajo Code Talkers helped expedite the end of the war saving thousands of lives. It wasn't until 1968 the Navajo Code Talkers program was declassified by the military. Since then, the Navajo code talkers have drawn the attention of crowds eager to hear their war stories.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/current-season-data.html">confirmed</a>&nbsp;reports of West Nile virus in 10 states. The bite of an infected mosquito most commonly spreads the virus.</p>



<p>"West Nile virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne illness in the U.S.,"&nbsp;says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/pritt-bobbi-s-m-d/bio-20514068?_ga=2.154748797.494579088.1679408198-755292986.1678201035?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Bobbi Pritt,</a>&nbsp;director of the Clinical Parasitology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It's a flavivirus —a specific type of RNA virus that can infect humans, birds and horses.</p>



<p>"West Nile virus is transmitted predominantly through the bite of an infected mosquito. Less commonly, it can be transmitted through other means, like blood transfusion," says Dr. Pritt. "The mosquito that's most commonly implicated is the&nbsp;<em>Culex</em>&nbsp;mosquito, different from the&nbsp;<em>Anopheles</em>&nbsp;mosquito that transmits malaria."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms</h3>



<p>Most people infected with the West Nile virus do not experience any symptoms though some may develop a fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting and rash. While most people fully recover, some may experience ongoing weakness and fatigue for months.</p>



<p>Severe symptoms from West Nile virus are uncommon though people over 60 face a higher risk of severe illness if infected. Those with medical conditions, such as <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-make-changes-to-stop-prediabetes-from-developing-into-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/multimedia/vid-20538081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension</a> or <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-understanding-chronic-kidney-disease-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney disease</a>, or who have undergone organ transplants, also are at an increased risk of serious health complications due to the virus.</p>



<p>Severe symptoms affecting the nervous system develop in about 1 in 150 infected people,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/symptoms/index.html">according</a>&nbsp;to the CDC. Severe symptoms may include inflammation of the brain, known as <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-do-you-know-about-encephalitis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encephalitis</a>, or of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meningitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350508?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">meningitis</a>.</p>



<p>Seek medical attention immediately if you have signs or symptoms of a serious infection, such as severe headaches, a stiff neck, disorientation or confusion. Hospitalization is usually necessary for a serious infection.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Testing and diagnosis </h3>



<p>"West Nile virus infection is usually diagnosed by detecting antibodies in a patient's blood sample. It's a type of test that we call serology," says Dr. Pritt. "Mayo Clinic Laboratories also offers a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, test that's particularly good for the first day to several days of infection. Usually, PCR would be combined with serology so that you don't miss infection."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h3>



<p>Mosquitoes can transmit a number of harmful pathogens, says Dr. Pritt, including the West Nile virus and malaria. The best way to avoid mosquito-borne illness is to avoid mosquitoes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Consider these tips:</strong></p>



<p>• Use insect repellent with DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus.<br>• Wear permethrin-treated clothing while outdoors or in the woods.<br>• Empty standing water in outdoor areas, including pet bowls and rain barrels.<br>• Install screens in windows.</p>



<p>"There are also measures people can take to control mosquito populations around their home," she says. "It's important to know that mosquitoes breed and lay their eggs in bodies of water. One of those preventive measures is to remove standing bodies of water around the house, such as bird baths and other containers that may collect rainwater, for example. Then you could also pay to have the outside of your home professionally treated."</p>
