<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&nbsp;In a new multicenter international study led by the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, researchers found that people with the B-cell precursor subtype of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> (BCP-ALL), who also lacked a genetic abnormality known as the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia/multimedia/how-the-philadelphia-chromosome-forms/img-20007421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia chromosome</a> and were in remission with no trace of cancer, showed significantly higher survival rates when blinatumomab was added to their chemotherapy treatment. The randomized study results are published this month in the New England Journal of Medicine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"These results are encouraging and establish a new standard of treatment for people with BCP-ALL," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/litzow-mark-r-m-d/bio-20053695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Litzow, M.D.</a>, lead study author and hematologist at the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "The addition of blinatumomab to chemotherapy reduced the risk of leukemia recurrence and death by nearly 60%."</p>



<p>Blinatumomab is a type of immunotherapy administered intravenously and brings a normal immune cell called a T cell close to a leukemia cell so it can destroy it. The Food and Drug Administration approved blinatumomab for patients in remission who have traces of cancer, also known as measurable residual disease (MRD)-positive. In this study, blinatumomab was added to see if it could lessen the risk of the ALL coming back and relapsing in a person who had no detection of cancer, also known as MRD-negative, following initial chemotherapy.</p>



<p>The study enrolled 488 participants aged 30 to 70 years with BCP-ALL, and 224 of them were in remission and MRD-negative following the initial course of treatment with chemotherapy. The 224 participants were equally randomized into two arms; the first arm would receive blinatumomab with chemotherapy, and the second arm would receive the standard treatment of chemotherapy alone.</p>



<p>The results showed that 85% of participants treated with blinatumomab and chemotherapy were alive at three years, compared to 68% of those who received chemotherapy alone, which is the standard treatment.</p>



<p>"We plan to build on this study to reduce the amount of chemotherapy people need to receive, ultimately leading to fewer side effects from the treatment and improving overall survival rates," Dr. Litzow says.</p>



<p>This study was conducted by the <a href="https://ecog-acrin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group</a> and funded in part by the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a> of the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>. See the full paper for the complete list of funding and authors.</p>



<p>Dr. Litzow has received research funding from Amgen and served on a speaker's bureau for Amgen related to this study.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>"When most patients come to us with pancreatic cancer, their cancer has already spread and their survival over a five-year period is only three percent. But if we catch them early, at stage 1A, their five-year survival rate can be as high as 80%," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/bi-yan-m-d-ph-d/bio-20530397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yan Bi, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "Detecting the cancer earlier is the best way to improve survival."</p>



<p>Early detection is tricky because the first symptoms of pancreatic cancer — digestive issues, belly pain and weight loss — are not specific. "Weight loss occurs even before the diagnosis," says Dr. Bi. "A majority of pancreatic cancer patients will lose weight before they discover they have cancer."</p>



<p>Studies have shown that as the disease progresses, cancer cells promote a wide range of metabolic and physiologic changes. Dr. Bi and her colleagues wondered if these changes could serve as biomarkers, to enable healthcare providers to detect pancreatic cancer earlier than ever before.</p>



<p>Dr. Bi teamed up with Derk Klatte, M.D., Ph.D., and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wallace-michael-b-m-d/bio-00092410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Wallace, M.D.</a>, to examine medical records of patients with a common type of pancreatic cancer known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who had been diagnosed at Mayo Clinic between 2002 and 2021. They analyzed abdominal CT scans and blood tests taken up to three years before the patients were diagnosed. Using advanced algorithms developed by data scientist Alex Weston, Ph.D., the researchers measured changes in body fat, muscle and bone, as well as shifts in blood-based biomarkers like cholesterol and glucose levels.</p>



<p>The findings, published in the journal <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38703880/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a>, revealed changes in a variety of physiological and metabolic measurements. The researchers observed significant reductions in both fat surrounding the organs (visceral fat) and the fat under the skin (subcutaneous fat) as patients approached their diagnosis date. In addition, patients exhibited a notable drop in serum lipids — fats found in the blood — such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol and triglycerides.</p>



<p>Conversely, the study found that blood glucose levels increased up to three years before patients were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, confirming a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29775599/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link previously described</a> by Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist Suresh Chari, M.D. Additional findings revealed that patients also experienced a loss of muscle mass and bone volume, which became more pronounced in the last six months before their cancer was detected.</p>



<p>"It is a bizarre condition," says Dr. Bi. "Patients' bodies are changing — they are losing weight and their total cholesterol levels are going down…many things you think would be healthy, but in this case, they're not. Nobody knows exactly what is going on, but we aim to find out."</p>



<p>Dr. Bi recently received two grants, one from the National Institutes of Health and another from the Department of Defense, to investigate how the growth of pancreatic tumors could drive such widespread metabolic changes.</p>



<p>She is also expanding her work on pancreatic cancer biomarkers, searching for the best combination of factors to make an early diagnosis. "We are using many different layers of information — medical records, labs and data gathered from wearable devices," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Bi is part of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/education-training/kern-health-care-delivery-scholars-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kern Health Care Delivery Scholars Program</a> in the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/education-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert D. and Patricia E.&nbsp;Kern&nbsp;Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a>. The program supports the next generation of clinically trained, doctoral-level fellows and junior faculty in health services research.</p>



<p>As a Kern Health Care Delivery Scholar, Dr. Bi has been working on a project that uses wearables like Apple Watches or Fitbits to track changes in body composition as well as the power of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>



<p>"My goal is to combine that information with all the other data we have on a patient and use AI to calculate their risk of developing pancreatic cancer in three years," she says. "If they are at increased risk, we could start doing surveillance with abdominal imaging."</p>



<p>The team's early findings suggest that capturing the subtle yet significant body changes that occur as pancreatic cancer develops could be a key strategy in the fight against the disease. Recognizing these changes early could lead to timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially saving lives.</p>



<p>Dr. Bi and her colleagues at Mayo Clinic are active in the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38626807/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pancreatic Cancer Early Detection (PRECEDE) consortium</a>, a global effort to improve early detection and prevention of pancreatic cancer. The consortium's goal is to increase the five-year survival rate to 50% percent after 10 years.</p>



<p>"It is very ambitious," she says, "but I hope we can reach that goal by pushing for early detection."</p>

<p>The new episode of <a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=tcepisodefive&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=global&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=185876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomorrow’s Cure</a> highlights the efforts of research scientists who are equipping a vaccine with bits of proteins that redirect the immune system's efforts to specifically fight cancer. The vaccine aims to prevent breast cancer tumors from returning, as relapsing cancer is often more aggressive and difficult to treat. The latest research also seeks to understand why some breast cancer tumors evade the body's immune response.</p>



<p>Featured experts are <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/knutson-keith-l-ph-d/bio-00026672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Keith Knutson</a>, an immunologist and cancer vaccine researcher at Mayo Clinic; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chumsri-saranya-m-d/bio-20114242?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=yext&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=departmentcancer&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=cancer&amp;cauid=105142&amp;y_source=1_OTE2NDc2NDktNDgzLWxvY2F0aW9uLndlYnNpdGU%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Saranya Chumsri</a>, a Mayo Clinic hematologist​; and <a href="https://hemonc.uw.edu/people/nora-disis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nora Disis,</a> director of the University of Washington Institute of Translational Health Science and the Center for Translational Medicine in Women’s Health at University of Washington.</p>



<p>Vaccines help to protect people from deadly viruses, but can they also help fight cancer? Vaccine trials are underway to target aggressive cancers such as triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancers. These types of cancers have a high reoccurrence rate.</p>

<p>"I think the tricky part is trying to activate our immune system to be able to recognize that particular cancer. It's different in different types of cancer," says Dr. Chumsri. "I think in breast cancer, it might be difficult for the immune system to generate <a>the</a> effective immune response, but that's what we all try to work for."</p>



<p>"We have a number of different approaches that we're using. So, for example, we have peptide vaccines that are administered with this danger signal so that we can alert the immune system to respond," explains Dr. Knutson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts say, in the future, vaccines would target cancer risk factors, such as inflammation.</p>



<p>"We're actively working on vaccines targeting cancer risk factors like chronic inflammation," says Dr. Disis. "So this would potentially be able to reduce their risk of development of cancer by controlling that chronic inflammation."</p>

<p>The burden of cancer is different for everyone, and life stages can play a role in how it affects people. For adolescents and young adults (AYAs) ages 15 to 39, cancer is a disruptor during a time when people are experiencing personal growth, taking on new responsibilities and becoming independent. This can take a toll on mental health, and the emotional and psychological distress of surviving cancer during these formative years can have long-term effects.</p>



<p>Kristine Donovan, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and co-director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/adolescent-young-adult-cancer-program/sections/overview/ovc-20564751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Program</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic, explains how cancer affects AYAs and how to cope.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prioritize your basic needs.</h2>



<p>When you experience a life-changing event like a cancer diagnosis, fundamental needs like sleep, nutrition and exercise can suffer. Cancer and cancer treatment side effects such as pain, nausea, poor appetite and fatigue can make meeting these needs challenging, ultimately affecting treatment response, mental well-being and quality of life.</p>



<p>If you are experiencing symptoms that make caring for yourself difficult, talk to your care team and ask about cancer-specific mental health support. "Patients have better outcomes when they work with a counselor or psychiatrist who routinely works with cancer patients," says Dr. Donovan. Counselors and mental health providers can help you decide the most effective treatment for your symptoms.</p>

<p>"Patients have better outcomes when they work with a counselor or psychiatrist who routinely works with cancer patients."</p>
<cite>Kristine Donovan, Ph.D.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Dr. Donovan says talk therapy, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>, and medication can be effective symptom-management tools. "If a patient is having challenges with appetite because of chemotherapy, a psychiatrist who works in&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/28/onco-psychology-helping-people-manage-cancer-related-distress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">onco-psychology</a>&nbsp;or the cancer space might know how to tackle more than one symptom with one medication."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Communicate with caregivers, friends and family.</h2>



<p>Understanding your needs and boundaries is an important part of preserving your mental health as a cancer patient and survivor, and Dr. Donovan says this exploration makes up much of her work with AYAs. "Helping patients communicate their needs can be helpful, especially for young adults who've had some growing independence from parents and family of origin, then they're hit with this diagnosis, and parents immediately want to protect and take care of them," she says.</p>



<p>Some people welcome support from family and friends but decide to keep parts of their cancer care and survivorship journey private. For example, you may not want your parents to have access to your health portal, but you would like them to accompany you to certain appointments. Voicing your level of comfort and preferences can help avoid frustration for you and those who support you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learn about the resources available to AYAs.</h2>



<p>Individual counseling, cancer support groups, social workers, and financial and career assistance might be available through your cancer care team. AYA-specific resources can also help you navigate the challenges you face.</p>



<p>"If you're 45 or 55, you tend to have more reserves — whether it's financial resources, emotional resources, or a wider network of friends or family who can help you. Younger adults are less likely to have those resources to help support them through the process," says Dr. Donovan. AYA resources are often curated with this in mind.</p>

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on what you can control.</h2>



<p>During your cancer journey, you will encounter circumstances out of your control, which can lead to feeling powerless. Dr. Donovan says this is a common feeling among AYAs she works with, and it can have a negative impact on mental health and make navigating cancer care, relationships and daily life more difficult.</p>



<p>"As psychologists, sometimes we see patients right after diagnosis before their treatment plans are even in place," says Dr. Donovan. This is often when uncertainty and worry are at an all-time high.</p>



<p>Though you may not have control over your diagnosis or if your cancer will come back, Dr. Donovan says AYAs can cope and regain a sense of power by focusing on things they can control. "I tell them, 'Let's figure out what you can do between now and two weeks from now when you get your treatment plan,'" she says.</p>



<p>If you were just diagnosed with cancer and don't know what to do next, consider:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Making a list of questions for your care team. Ask about resources they can offer you.</li>



<li>Finding an ally, such as a friend or family member you can rely on for emotional support, company at appointments, advocacy or day-to-day help.</li>



<li>Connecting with peers by joining a <a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/event/aya-adolescents-and-young-adults-support-group-14-8370/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer support group</a> with members who can offer guidance.</li>



<li>Adopting habits to improve your sleep, and asking your healthcare professional for support if you continue to have trouble sleeping.</li>



<li>Eating a <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2021/12/30/7-steps-to-better-nutrition-habits-for-cancer-survivors/">well-balanced diet</a> to nourish your body before treatment.</li>



<li>Talking to a school counselor or your employer's human resources team to learn about medical leave policies and schedule flexibility.</li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. Donovan says it's also important to do things you enjoy in periods before or between treatments. "If you have two weeks before surgery, for example, how do you want to spend that time? Maybe you can finish that work project if that's important to you — or maybe you just want to relax and spend those weeks with friends and family."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understand that it's OK to grieve.</h2>



<p>You may feel grief for many reasons, and they are all valid. Missed college experiences and career goals, prolonged family planning, and financial hurdles are just a few of the many possible effects of cancer.</p>



<p>"It's a life interrupted," says Dr. Donovan. "It's a big shift to go from being a full-time student, young parent or employee to a full-time cancer patient."</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>"It's a big shift to go from being a full-time student, young parent or employee to a full-time cancer patient."</p>
<cite>Kristine Donovan, Ph.D.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Dr. Donovan shares how she observed this shift in her own family. "My brother died of cancer at 35. When he was really sick, he would go to my parents’ house and our mother would put him in a recliner while she took care of his two-year-old daughter. So things shifted. He went from being a successful broadcaster to just being able to hang out with his mom and youngest child," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Donovan adds that acknowledging the grief and discomfort of cancer can sometimes allow you to begin to find meaningful connections again despite your diagnosis. "Your priorities shift; I've seen this in patients. Their world shrinks, but they're able to find meaning and purpose. In my brother's case, he continued to parent to the best of his ability," she says.</p>



<p>This loss of independence, in any capacity, can feel devastating. "The thing I've found to be most meaningful for patients is just acknowledging how sad it is and how hard it is," says Dr. Donovan. "There's nothing you can say to make that better, but we can give them permission and space to express and process these feelings."</p>

<p>Nuclear medicine therapy is sometimes the best option for people who no longer respond to other cancer treatments. It is often helpful for patients with cancers that are historically hard to treat, like prostate cancer or lymphoma. On the latest episode of <a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=tcepisodefour&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=global&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=185875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomorrow’s Cure</a>, find out how nuclear medicine, when combined with other therapies, will control symptoms and shrink and stabilize tumors, sometimes for years.</p>



<p>This week’s podcast episode features <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/johnson-geoffrey-b-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Geoffrey Johnson</a>, Chair of the Division of Nuclear Medicine and radiologist and nuclear medicine physician at Mayo Clinic; and <a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/George+Sgouros/2777500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. George Sgouros</a>, Director of Radiological Physics Division and Professor of Radiology and Radiological Science at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.</p>



<p>"With chemotherapeutics, we never really know where these things are going. Are they targeting <a>the cancer</a> or where are they going?" Dr. Sgorous says. "[With] this new approach, we can generate images that tell us where the therapeutic agent is going, and it is no longer the black box that it has always been. That’s really a fundamental difference is this treatment."</p>



<p>"If we can give enough radiation safely to the tumors, we can kill anything," Dr. Johnson says. "We can go after any type of cancer with this type of therapy."</p>

<p>Glioblastoma is a type of cancer affecting glial cells, which connect nerve cells and support brain function.</p>



<p>"It tends to be a tumor that also tends to grow and invade the brain," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/quinones-hinojosa-alfredo-m-d/bio-20238939?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa</a>, a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic. "Sometimes it can be slow and steady, but it tends to grow very fast."</p>



<p>Despite significant advances in surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation technology, the prognosis of glioblastoma remains poor.</p>



<p>“The median survival of patients with the best therapies tends to be between 12 and 14 months,” says Dr. Quinones-Hinojosa.</p>



<p>There is no known cure for glioblastoma, but treatments may help slow the progression or help stabilize the quality of life. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/brain-tumor-stem-cell-research/overview?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a> is making strides, giving patients more options and hope.</p>



<p>“Research is crucial to find hope and healing on every corner of our operating room, in every corner of our laboratory, and to connect those two, ultimately, through our patients," says Dr. Quinones-Hinojosa.</p>

<p>Growing up as the child of a voice instructor, Emily Hardy developed a lifelong interest in singing. But the third-year student at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine</a> never dreamed her interest in vocals would lead to research related to the first larynx transplant at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"When I first learned that Mayo Clinic was advancing the larynx transplant, I thought the procedure is something that will be exciting for Mayo to be able to do for patients — something I couldn't even fathom," she says. "I knew I wanted to be fully involved in advancing the research in this area."</p>



<p>In addition to her medical degree, Hardy is pursuing a master's degree at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>. Her research project is looking at ways to make the post-laryngeal transplant regimen easier for patients. Because receiving a transplant requires lifelong immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of the new organ, Hardy is investigating removing the cells of a laryngeal transplant model, looking for approaches that reduce the immune response and, hopefully, the need for medication.</p>



<p>"If we can reduce the immune response or the need for immunosuppression that could make laryngeal transplant available to more patients and improve their quality of life," she says.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Voice as a hobby and a scientific study</strong></h2>



<p>Finding joy in singing with others, Hardy participated in a choir in college, and, when she came to medical school at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, she performed with a community-based barbershop group.</p>



<p>"I've always loved anything related to the voice," she says. "When I came to medical school, I'd never thought of incorporating that into my career until I began learning about laryngology and ear nose and throat surgery and realized how those specialties matched that specific interest."</p>



<p>As a medical student also interested in conducting biomedical research, her interest in the intersection of that work and singing would put her at the cutting edge of a brand-new field of study: regenerative sciences. During her first year of medical school, as she sought opportunities to work in a lab, she found <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-00092606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology (ENT) - <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/head-and-neck-cancer-center/sections/overview/ovc-20457072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Surgery</a>/Audiology at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>. His research applies the approaches of regenerative medicine to restoring the voices of patients who have had a laryngectomy — a surgery to remove the voice box.</p>



<p>Regenerative medicine is an approach that shifts the focus from treating disease to rebuilding health by repairing, replacing or restoring damaged tissues, cells or organs.&nbsp;As director of the Head and Neck Regenerative Medicine Lab at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Lott has focused on establishing techniques to regenerate the voice box and restore its abilities after diseases or traumas.</p>



<p>His work led to the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-marks-medical-milestone-with-worlds-first-known-successful-total-larynx-transplant-performed-in-a-patient-with-an-active-cancer-as-part-of-a-clinical-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first laryngeal transplant at Mayo Clinic</a> — actually replacing a damaged voice box with all its necessary functions. People whose voice box was damaged from injury, cancer or the residual effects of radiation treatment — as many as 60,000 people in the U.S. — can neither speak with their natural voices nor breathe through their noses. Mayo Clinic is in the process of establishing the first ongoing larynx transplant program in the country. Dr. Lott and colleagues are advancing the transplant procedure and also exploring other regenerative approaches to larynx restoration, including the use of stem cells and growth factors to help grow functional tissue.</p>



<p>As Hardy learned about the lab's various approaches to laryngeal transplant and the potential to restore function through regenerative sciences, she knew she wanted to contribute to research to further options for voice-impaired patients.</p>



<p>The field of regenerative medicine is so new that few people are versed in its principles and techniques. Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of training the workforce in this emerging field, offering doctoral and post-graduate training in Regenerative Sciences through the Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. Hardy is an example of the future physician-scientists that Mayo is training to deliver the newest regenerative technologies and carry on the work for the next generation.</p>



<p>"Education plays a key role, complementing the research and practice components, in the laryngeal transplant," says Dr. Lott. The entire staff involved in a transplant rehearsed and trained for it, including nurses who underwent specialized in-service training and online courses. Training for the laryngeal transplant provided a unique learning opportunity for residents at<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education</a>, including head and neck surgical resident Payam Entezami, M.D., who assisted the surgical team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address patient needs following the transplant, Hardy found she could amplify her medical school training by pausing it to pursue a master's degree in regenerative sciences, attending classes about its innovative approaches and conducting research in Dr. Lott's lab. She is among Mayo's first students in the program, and says she is impressed by the topics involved — stem cells, tissue engineering, 3D bioprinting — and the vast areas of medicine it touches.</p>



<p>"There are so many different approaches within regenerative medicine and ways to apply it to specific clinical areas of interest," she says.</p>



<p>"We’re educating a specialized clinical workforce of the future, who will have the understanding to manifest the potential held within regenerative medicine," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wyles-saranya-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-20476857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saranya Wyles, M.D., Ph.D.</a> a dermatologist and associate director of education at Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "Regenerative technologies, focused on restoring form and function, have the potential to transform standard of care. The approach begets a new set of skills."</p>



<p>Dr. Lott is enthusiastic that Hardy's research will contribute to the growing information about laryngeal transplant. He's also emphatic about the importance of the various educational opportunities emerging in regenerative medicine.</p>



<p>"We're training the next generation of scientists and clinicians who are going to be pushing the field ahead," he says. "It's one thing to be able to develop regenerative approaches for patients now. It's a whole other to establish the experts in this new field who can help patients for years and years down the road."</p>

<p><em>Surgeons at Mayo Clinic in Arizona perform a total larynx transplant</em></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's unique culture of teamwork and collaboration, hallmarks since the days of Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie Mayo, laid the foundation for Mayo's first larynx transplant that happened February 29 in Arizona. This groundbreaking surgery, only third larynx transplant in the U.S., continues the innovative work for which the Mayo brothers were known.</p>

They transplanted a donor larynx in a 59-year-old patient with cancer whose damaged larynx hampered his ability to talk, swallow and breathe.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">larynx transplant</a> was a composite neck transplant that included at least eight different types of tissue, including the larynx, upper trachea, upper esophagus, pharynx, thyroid glands, parathyroid glands, nerves and blood vessels — commonly called the throat.&nbsp; It's a rare type of transplant known as a vascular composite allograft.&nbsp; The larynx — also called the voice box — is a delicate organ composed of tissue, cartilage and joints that must be able to move after transplantation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A team science approach to larynx transplantation</strong></h2>



<p>This complex surgery is an example of Mayo Clinic's team science approach, to advance research innovation to patient care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic's team science approach made it possible for us to offer this type of a transplant on a scale that was previously unattainable," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-00092606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, chair of the Arizona Department of Otolaryngologist and lead surgeon. "All transplants are complex, but there are more tissue types and moving parts with laryngeal transplantation than other transplants.</p>



<p>In any transplant, the body's immune system flags the donor organ as a foreign object and tries to reject it. A key to success is identifying the right immunosuppressant drugs that allow the body to recognize and accept the new tissue. That was exceptionally challenging in this complex surgery that required eight types of donor tissue. This first transplant will serve as a baseline for understanding the various immune responses, quality of life and long-term sustainability of the larynx transplant.</p>



<p>"Our research laid the foundation for understanding the unique immunosuppressant needs of the patient after transplanting multiple types of tissues," says Dr. Lott. "Preclinical models helped us learn which medications could regulate the immune responses of the various different donor tissue with fewest potential side effects and still be powerful enough to prevent rejection."</p>



<p>This is also the first known larynx transplant in a patient with active cancer who was part of a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03269396?intr=larynx%20transplant&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial.</a> &nbsp;Dr. Lott and the team will now conduct research aimed at establishing scientific evidence to support the first-ever clinical service line in laryngeal transplantation.</p>



<p>"Because this surgery is so rare, there are a lot of unknowns.&nbsp; We will continue our study of laryngeal transplantation in the patient's follow-up care to determine how well the new organ has restored his ability to talk, breathe and eat," says Dr. Lott. "Besides the quality-of-life issues, we want to study how well the transplanted tissues are functioning over time."</p>



<p>The initial focus of the larynx transplant study will be patients who have a voice box that is no longer functional due to previous cancer or traumatic injury. The team is not yet transplanting a donor larynx in a person who has had a total larynx removal — known as a laryngectomy. They hope to use the research to improve this surgery to make it possible for more patients, including those without a larynx, in the near future.</p>

<p>Dr. Lott is the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology in Arizona, director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/head-and-neck-regenerative-medicine/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Regenerative Medicine Lab at Mayo Clinic</a>, surgical director of the Larynx and Trachea Transplantation Program, and the associate director of the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> in Arizona.

<p>What do tobacco, alcohol and obesity have in common? They can all increase your risk of developing cancer. Smoked tobacco is strongly linked to cancer in almost every part of the body.</p>



<p>"Smoked tobacco produces about 7,000 chemicals, and when you inhale those chemicals in your body, they cause alterations in cells. And it's those alterations in cells that can lead to cancer," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>He says smoking also weakens your immune system, making it harder to fight cancer cells. One of the best ways to lower your cancer risk is to not use any kind of tobacco.</p>



<p>"We always say it's never too late to stop smoking. And the risk for cancer after quitting cigarette smoking, for example, goes down. But it takes some time," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Consuming alcohol increases your risk of breast, head and neck, esophageal, and colorectal cancers.</p>



<p>"At every level of alcohol consumption, there is cancer risk, but heavier drinkers have higher cancer risk than lighter drinkers," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Finally, packing on extra pounds can increase your risk of cancer in several ways.</p>



<p>"Excess body weight increases estrogen and insulin, which can increase the rate of cellular division, which can increase the risk for cancer. But also, excess body weight is associated with inflammation, and inflammation is a known risk factor for the development of cancer," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Bariatric surgery has been shown to decrease risk of hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrial and prostate, as well as pancreatic and colorectal cancers. However, there are less drastic steps people can take.</p>



<p>"Small sustainable steps toward weight loss are the most effective when we think about diet and exercise. Those are the classic approaches, but also there are new medications on the market that can help people lose weight," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>

Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/What-is-laryngeal-chondrosarcoma.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script.</a></strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, like the rest of your body, things can go wrong, including cancer.</p>



<p>"Laryngeal chondrosarcoma are cancers of the cartilage within the larynx," says Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>It's an uncommon cancer, accounting for about 1% of overall laryngeal cancers. Symptoms may include hoarseness, breathing difficulties and pain in the throat. "Laryngeal chondrosarcomas are treated a little bit differently than the typical laryngeal cancers," adds Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>Step 1, he says, is determining the grade of cancer. Is it mild or a more aggressive form?</p>



<p>"If there's a lot of destruction and the patient is having a lot of symptoms, like not being able to breathe or not being able to swallow or have lost their voice, then we need to act a little more aggressively to try to remove that tumor to try to preserve what function they have," says Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>Because of its rarity and the intricate anatomy, this cancer type needs specialized care from a team of experts, including otolaryngologists and oncologists. According to Dr. Lott, unlike many cancers, even some other laryngeal cancers, "there really isn't much that people do to get that type of a cancer. It's not strictly associated with things like smoking or alcohol use. It tends to be, honestly, just bad luck."</p>
