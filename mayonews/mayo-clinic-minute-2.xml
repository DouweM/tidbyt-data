<p>Many people have lost unwanted pounds by using popular injectable weight-loss medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound. These drugs contain semaglutide, liraglutide or tirzepatide, which curb appetite and increase insulin sensitivity. Some studies show that you can lose up to 15% of your body weight. But what if you want to wean off weight-loss medications?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shah-meera-m-b-ch-b/bio-20114165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Meera Shah</a>, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist, says that if you want to lose weight permanently, you need to stay consistently active and eat a nutritious diet.</p>

<p>You step on the scale and the numbers are moving in the right direction after taking one of the popular injectable weight-loss drugs. But now you want to stop the medication, so what do you do? How long can you stay on these drugs?</p>



<p>"We just haven't had people on this class of medicines for long enough to know what happens in five years, even three years, and when might be the right time to withdraw people off these medicines," says Dr. Shah.</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9542252/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> show people regain weight after ditching diet drugs.</p>



<p>"If you stopped medication, say within six months of being on it, there's a very high chance for weight regain," explains Dr Shah.</p>



<p>This could have something to do with an increase in appetite once you stop taking weight-loss medications.</p>



<p>"What the medicine is doing is it's actually changing those appetite signals, but when you don't have that medicine on board, then your body goes back to its default state," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team before stopping these types of weight-loss drugs.&nbsp; It's also a good idea to eat a balanced diet and stay active.</p>

<p>Legionnaires' disease is a type of serious pneumonia that people can get typically from exposure to mist or water. It's not spread person-to-person.</p>

<p>"Legionnaires' disease is spread through inhaling mist that has the Legionella bacteria in it," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>



<p>"That mist can come from many different sources that use water. The more common places that we see outbreaks associated are whirlpools, air conditioning units or fountains," she says.</p>



<p>Home and car air conditioning units aren't a risk for Legionella growth because they don't use water to cool the air.</p>



<p>Not everyone exposed gets sick, but some people are more susceptible to illness than others.</p>



<p>"Certain people might be at more risk of getting Legionnaires' disease; we definitely see it more commonly in older individuals or people who have weakened immune systems," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms</h2>



<p>It can take 2 to 4 days after exposure to feel symptoms.</p>



<p>"Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease can start as a flu-like illness with fever, body aches, cough, malaise, kind of feeling really tired; then [it] can present like pneumonia," she says.</p>



<p>It can progress to severe illness requiring hospitalization.</p>



<p>Although the infection primarily affects the lungs, occasionally, it can cause infections in wounds and in other parts of the body, including the heart.</p>



<p>"When identified and treated early, it is treatable with antibiotics," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>

<p>School is a huge part of kids' lives, and it can be very stressful, particularly during transitions, such as the beginning of the school year when they're returning after an extended break. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/whiteside-stephen-p-ph-d-l-p/bio-20054748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stephen Whiteside</a>, a psychologist with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's Center</a>, says for kids who are more anxious, it can be one of those stress points that brings underlying anxiety disorders to the surface.</p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, he discusses how parents can determine if their child is experiencing normal anxiety or if they are showing signs of a potential anxiety disorder, which can make life more difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:05) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/SCRIPT-MCM-Is-your-kid-anxious-B2S-SCRIPT-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"Feeling anxious is perfectly normal. We all feel, most of us feel anxious," says Dr. Whiteside. Sometimes anxiety can be brought on by a stressful situation in a child's life.</p>



<p>"Sometimes kids are nervous and worried and afraid because life is stressful. So, they're failing their classes or they're being bullied at school or there's arguing and fighting at home, and there's something bad happening that is making them anxious," he says.</p>



<p>Stress and problems in life are important, and kids may need help from their parents to deal with them. However, stress is different from an anxiety disorder.</p>



<p>"An anxiety disorder is when kids feel more nervous, worried or afraid of things than we would expect them to be," says Dr. Whiteside. One of the most common anxiety disorders seen in kids is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/social-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social anxiety disorder</a>.</p>



<p>"It's kids who are not just shy, they're very worried that people will judge them, that they'll make mistakes, and their shyness prevents them from doing things that they want to do or they need to do," explains Dr. Whiteside.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Signs of a potential anxiety disorder</h2>



<p>As for signs of a potential anxiety disorder, Dr. Whiteside says to think about a child having three jobs: school, family life and social activities.</p>



<p>Signs of anxiety or other mental health concerns:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>School: Missing school or difficulty getting them to school</li>



<li>Family: Isolation, withdrawing from family interaction</li>



<li>Social activities: Avoiding getting together with friends</li>
</ul>



<p>"If your child is not doing things that they enjoy, isolating themselves, withdrawing from activities, [are] more irritable and upset, frequently tearful, especially if it's a change from how they normally have been acting….If one of those three jobs is not going well, that's one sign that your child may be struggling from anxiety or another mental health concern," says Dr. Whiteside.</p>



<p>To address a potential anxiety or mental health disorder, Dr. Whiteside says parents should start by having a conversation with their child. If the child is not receptive, then he recommends parents speak with their child's pediatrician or primary care team.</p>

But you don't need to spend money on new office equipment to achieve the benefits of an active workstation.</p>

<p>Sitting at a desk for hours at a time may make some feel exhausted and unmotivated. If that's ever happened to you, it may be time for a snack … an activity snack.</p>



<p>The concept is simple, after sitting for an hour, take two to three minutes to get up and move your body.</p>



<p>"You break this sedentary status of your body by going to take the stairs for two or three flights, or just do some push-ups or do something that is meaningful in terms of activity for just a few minutes, and then come back and continue your work," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>In a way, Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says those two to three minutes reset your metabolic clock.</p>



<p>"It has been impressive, the biological changes those activity snacks can induce in your cells, in the metabolism of the sugar, in the metabolism of the cholesterol, just by having those little episodes of activity, even though you might be sitting down for the next 45 minutes," he says.</p>



<p>It's a small change that can make a big impact on your physical and mental health.</p>



<p>"You will see how that little thing will even sharpen your mind for the next half an hour, 45 minutes, absolutely," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>After a summer of fun, kids are returning to the classroom and that means close contact with each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"That's really the perfect setup for infections to start to circulate. Getting them vaccinated, making sure that they're up to date on all their routine vaccinations not only helps to protect them, but it helps to protect everyone else that might be in their classroom as well," explains Dr. Rajapakse.</p>

<p>She says those routine vaccinations help protect against many preventable illnesses, "like tetanus, whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox."</p>



<p>Vaccines, she says, help the immune system combat serious infections and limit the risk of serious illness.</p>



<p>"They're a way to train our immune system to recognize these pathogens, so that if you do ever come across them, our immune system already knows how to fight them off," Dr. Rajapakse says.</p>



<p>And early protection through vaccination helps prevents future illness.</p>



<p>"These are all really safe and effective vaccines that help keep our kids safe in the classroom safe," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>

<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, Rebekah Huppert, nurse and lactation consultant at Mayo Clinic, discusses how latching and feeding challenges caused by tongue-tie can be addressed with or without the need for any procedure.</p>

<p>Latching and feeding challenges can be caused by a number of issues. Tongue-tie sometimes can be to blame.</p>



<p>"Typically, the things that we see the tongue causing problems with are going to be the latch. Primarily, it's difficult for baby to get a hold of the nipple and pull it into the soft palate," says Huppert.</p>



<p>With tongue-tie, an unusually short, thick or tight band of tissue tethers the bottom of the tongue's tip to the floor of the mouth, restricting the tongue's range of motion.</p>



<p>"The band of tissue is something that we can look for, but sometimes you can see it and the tongue moves great. And sometimes it's not super obvious and the tongue doesn't move well. So although that can be an indicator, it isn't the diagnosis just because it's there," says Huppert.</p>



<p>Some cases may require a simple surgical procedure for correction. But not all babies with tongue-tie require treatment. Some families and care providers choose a wait-and-see approach. In that case, Huppert suggests working with a lactation professional who can provide some strategies.</p>



<p>"We can work on different positionings with latch. One of the primary things that we like to do is what we call the laid-back position, where we have moms kind of laying back on their back. That's thought to have gravity bring that chin and tongue forward a little bit more."</p>

<p><strong>For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place. Anyone shown without a mask was recorded prior to COVID-19 or recorded in an area not designated for patient care, where safety protocols were followed.</strong></p>

<p>"We used to think of hearing loss as separate from our overall health, as something that is just a normal part of aging. Everyone gets it. It's not a big deal. But we're learning more that, actually, untreated hearing loss can result in a negative spiral of other health issues," says Dr. Deep.</p>



<p>With greater hearing loss, the brain has to work overtime to interpret the garbled message. That uses up brain power. There's less cognitive reserve for thinking, memory or other higher level brain functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Deep says patients get frustrated by their inability to communicate. They may withdraw socially, become less active and less connected with their friends and family. This can lead to loneliness, social isolation and depression. These are all independent risk factors for cognitive decline.</p>



<p>Social isolation fueled by untreated hearing loss can affect not only a person's mind but also their body.</p>



<p>"They stay at home more. Their physical activities are starting to go down. As a result, their balance is declining. They're at increased risk for falls, which is a huge issue in the elderly. It's not surprising then, that untreated hearing loss has been a risk factor for increasing risk for falls, hospitalization, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and even mortality," says Dr. Deep.</p>



<p>Treating hearing loss with different solutions — such as hearing aids or cochlear implants — can reduce all these risks and improve quality of life.</p>

<p>Starting a workout program or being physically active takes motivation and commitment. The key is to start slowly and do something you take pleasure in.</p>



<p>"If you hate swimming, don't try to start to become a swimmer. But (if) you enjoy dancing or other activities (such as) gardening, those are forms of activity that once you engage in, you increase your consistency and compliance that will have the most health benefits," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>

<p>Being active can build muscle strength and improve cognitive and cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>"Three percent, or 30 minutes a day, of our waking hours, if we commit that to physical activity, will have huge benefits," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>And for those young at heart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.</p>



<p>"As we get older, dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips to get started and stick with a workout plan:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Research workout routines.</li>



<li>Schedule your workouts.</li>



<li>Find an exercise buddy.</li>



<li>Be consistent.</li>

<p>Could a short diet questionnaire encourage patients to make better food choices and improve heart health? In the past, your healthcare team had to rely on lengthy surveys to better understand what you were eating. But that's all changed with the <a href="https://minieat.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mini-EAT assessment tool</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-20053705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, explains how this free, relatively new technology is helping patients and healthcare professionals.</p>

<p>Eating habits play a significant role in your health. So how much and what kinds of foods do you eat in a week? Healthcare professionals often ask these questions during an exam, which can sometimes be tedious.</p>



<p>"Very extensive surveys of 110 questions or 120 questions pretty much asking you about every single food you had," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic simplified the process by creating the Mini-EAT assessment tool. It consists of nine dietary-specific questions and takes about two minutes to complete.</p>



<p>"When the person is telling you that he's eating fruits and vegetables every day and avoiding fast food, you know just by having those responses that that person very likely is doing the right thing," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>Being mindful of your diet could help prevent heart disease and high blood pressure.</p>



<p>"Blood pressure might be affected by the quality of our foods, and cholesterol too, which we know leads to heart disease," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>With the Mini-EATS tool, healthcare professionals will be able to give patients more accurate, individualized information so they can make healthier nutritional choices.</p>

<p>Does your thumb hurt when you're scrolling on your phone? Is it made worse when gripping objects? You could be suffering from basilar thumb joint arthritis.</p>



<p>"Patients will typically complain, for example, in opening a jar, turning a key, opening a doorknob will cause pain," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-thumb-arthritis-original.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of thumb arthritis" class="wp-image-213373" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-thumb-arthritis-original.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-thumb-arthritis-original-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<p>In a normal thumb joint, bones are covered in cartilage, but with arthritis, the cartilage wears away, causing joint damage and pain.</p>



<p>"Which is basically pain as the thumb bone is grinding down every time you pinch a pound of pressure between the thumb and the index finger is magnified twelvefold," explains Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>Several <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378344">treatment options</a> are available to relieve aching joints, including medication, splints and, in some cases, surgery.</p>



<p>"We can do minimally invasive surgeries, for example, putting a camera in and cleaning it out. Or some of these nerves that give nerve endings to the bone, we actually get rid of those nerve endings to decrease the pain," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>In more advanced arthritis, surgeons either remove the arthritic bone or perform a joint replacement. If symptoms persist, see a certified hand therapist.</p>
