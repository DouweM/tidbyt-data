<p>Of all the symptoms associated with psoriasis of the scalp, many patients find the itch most bothersome.</p>



<p>"Oftentimes patients will have scales on their skin on their scalp that itches or kind of stings when they go to shampoo their scalp, and they just assume that it's really bad dandruff," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>Dr. Davis says psoriasis is thought to be an immune system issue that results in faster-than-normal growth of skin cells.</p>

<p>"Typically, skin will grow and shed in 28-to-30-day cycles, but psoriasis skin grows and tries to shed in a 72-hour cycle. It’s almost growing 10 times the speed of normal skin," she says.</p>



<p>There is no cure for psoriasis, but there are <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriasis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355845?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatments</a>.</p>



<p>"The treatments we use for psoriasis help decrease the inflammation in the skin and turn off that cell cascade of the immune system," Dr. Davis says.</p>



<p>Dr. Davis says maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding tobacco and excess alcohol can help to decrease the severity of psoriasis.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> How to manage symptoms of psoriasis</h3>



<ul>
<li>Apply moisturizer daily.</li>



<li>Use gentle or mild soap.</li>



<li>Don't scratch. </li>



<li>Avoid stress. </li>
</ul>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team for treatment or new strategy options if the discomfort of psoriasis is affecting your quality of life.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children’s Center</a> has been verified as a Level 1 Children's Surgery Center by the American College of Surgeons Children's Surgery Verification Quality Improvement Program (ACS CSV).<br>&nbsp;<br>The <a href="https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/accreditation-and-verification/childrens-surgery-verification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACS CSV</a> program was developed to improve the quality of children's surgical care by creating a system that allows for a prospective match of every child's individual surgical needs with a care environment that has optimal pediatric resources. Verified centers must meet criteria outlined in CSV standards by ensuring that children facing surgery receive care under a multidisciplinary program with quality improvement and safety processes, data collection and appropriate resources provided to them as patients at the hospital.<br>&nbsp;<br>The CSV program is based on other nationally recognized American College of Surgeons quality improvement programs that have measurably improved surgical quality, prevented complications, reduced costs and saved lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Every day, our team at the Mayo Clinic Children's Center provides the highest quality care to pediatric patients suffering the most complex and heart-wrenching illnesses, from congenital anomalies to pediatric oncology," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/flick-randall-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20053420?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Randall Flick, M.D.</a>, medical director of Mayo Clinic Children's Center. "We are incredibly proud of the ACS's verification of our team's hard work transforming children's lives and operating at the forefront of healthcare's capability."<br>&nbsp;<br>Mayo Clinic Children's Center's commitment to quality care begins with appropriately trained staff and leadership from surgeons who participate in meetings throughout the year to review the center's surgical outcomes. The surgical team seeks continuous improvement to enhance the structure, process and outcomes of the center.<br>&nbsp;<br>To become a verified center, Mayo Clinic Children's Center met essential criteria for staffing, training and facility infrastructure, and protocols for care, ensuring its ability to appropriately care for children who are surgical patients. The center also participates in a national data registry that yields semiannual reports on the quality of its processes and outcomes, thus identifying opportunities for continuous quality improvement.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The American College of Surgeons sets a very high standard for quality and organization of their surgical programs," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/potter-d-dean-jr-m-d/bio-20154706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">D. Dean Potter Jr., M.D.</a>, a pediatric surgeon who led Mayo Clinic Children's Center's efforts to achieve ACS CSV verification. "The verification is not about meeting common standards for care. It's about demonstrating how we work as a multidisciplinary team to provide the highest quality of care and continually improve as healthcare evolves. Our teams are filled with joy at this recognition of the hard work they do each day."<br>&nbsp;<br>After submitting an application, centers seeking verification undergo an extensive site visit by an ACS team of surveyors. The surveyor teams consist of experienced children's surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses who review the center's structure, process and clinical outcomes data. The current Optimal Resources for Children's Surgical Care manual drives the application and is used as a guideline in conducting the survey.</p>



<p>"Receiving the verification justifies and recognizes all the work that everyone does," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/warner-lindsay-l-m-d/bio-20528409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lindsay Warner, M.D.,</a> director of Performance Improvement and Patient Safety for the Pediatric Surgical Practice. "It allows us to share with everyone what we've always known: that Mayo Clinic Children's Center provides the highest quality care&nbsp;— and is an incredibly special place — for our smallest patients."</p>

<p><a href="https://wmhdofficial.com/about-the-world-mental-health-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Mental Health Day</a> will be observed on Tuesday, Oct. 10. The <a href="https://wmhdofficial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">theme of this year's recognition</a> is "Mental Health is a Universal Human Right."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/mental-health/art-20044098?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental health</a> is the overall wellness of how you think, regulate your feelings and behave. A mental disorder may be present when patterns or changes in thinking, feeling or behaving cause distress or disrupt a person's ability to function.</p>



<p>Cultural norms and social expectations also play a role in defining mental health. There is no standard measure across cultures to determine whether a behavior is normal or when it becomes disruptive. What might be normal in one society may be a cause for concern in another.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/symptoms-causes/syc-20374968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental illness</a> refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function. About 1 in 5 adults has a mental illness in any given year, and mental illness can begin at any age.</p>



<p>Examples of mental illness include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Depression.</li>



<li>Anxiety disorders.</li>



<li>Schizophrenia.</li>



<li>Eating disorders.</li>



<li>Addictive behaviors.</li>
</ul>



<p>Access to mental health treatment is an important part of overall healthcare services. It's also important to understand the roles of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health-providers/art-20045530?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different types of mental health specialists</a> to find the one that fits your needs. The best choice for your care will depend on your concern or condition; whether you need medications, counseling or both; and your health insurance coverage. Finding the right match is crucial to establishing a good relationship and getting the most out of your treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374974?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment</a> depends on the type of mental illness, its severity and what works best for you. In many cases, a combination of treatments may be recommended. If you have a mild mental illness with well-controlled symptoms, treatment from your primary healthcare professional may be sufficient. However, often a team approach is appropriate to make sure all your psychiatric, medical and social needs are met.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, negative attitudes and beliefs toward people who have a mental health condition are common. Others' judgments almost always stem from a lack of understanding rather than information based on facts.

<p>When does a trickle sound like a waterfall? After you get hearing aids, according to Charlie Pierce.</p>



<p>"I spent so many years not hearing the things that I can hear now. I can hear the smallest noise in the next room," he says. "It's incredible."</p>



<p>Charlie's improved hearing has done more than amplify the sounds he hears ― it helped the 55-year-old start a new career.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Construction work and overcoming addiction</h2>



<p>For over 40 years, Charlie worked in construction. But his career was beginning to take a toll on his body, and he felt drawn to a different path — working with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).</p>



<p>"I started the application process to work for the TSA, but I talked myself out of it," Charlie recalls, feeling that the timing wasn't right.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="325" height="325" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/pierces.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-374404 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/pierces.jpg 325w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/pierces-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/pierces-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Charlie continued his job as a construction superintendent in Tennessee. He also overcame a 38-year addiction to drugs and alcohol, thanks to attending two addiction recovery programs in 2019. He and wife, Amy Pierce, were married the following year.</p>



<p>"Amy and I agreed that we wouldn't make any other major life changes until I was a year sober," he says.</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making a change</h2>



<p>In September 2022, the Pierces decided to relocate to Faribault, Minnesota, to be closer to family. When Charlie saw an advertisement for TSA positions at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, he knew just what to do.</p>



<p>"It seemed like a God moment that I was seeing it again, so I applied," he says.</p>



<p>During the application screening and medical exam process, Charlie learned that years of construction and power tools had taken more than just a toll on his muscles and joints. He had hearing loss that could potentially exclude him from a TSA career.</p>



<p>Time was of the essence for Charlie in addressing his hearing issue. He knew that his application would be denied for medical reasons if he failed the hearing test.</p>



<p>"I knew I needed to see someone right away," he says. "I wasn't just going to give up at that point."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/hearing-aids.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-374403" style="width:480px;height:332px" width="480" height="332" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/hearing-aids.jpg 325w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/hearing-aids-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Audiology, hearing aids to the rescue</h2>



<p>A week later, Charlie's hearing was evaluated by audiologist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/albert-lea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dana McCray, Au.D.</a>, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/albert-lea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Albert Lea</a>, Minnesota.</p>



<p>"When Charlie arrived in my office, it was evident that it was extraordinarily important to him to get into TSA," says Dr. McCray. "He shared some of his story with me and how he was really working hard to get on a better path."</p>



<p>Dr. McCray thoroughly tested Charlie's hearing and discovered that his damage was different in each ear.</p>



<p>"In most cases when hearing changes, it happens equally, left and right," says Dr. McCray. "His loss is milder on the left and moderately severe on the right. We may never really know what caused the greater loss for Charlie in just one ear."</p>



<p>Dr. McCray explained the degree of Charlie's hearing loss to him and recommended hearing aids to improve it. Hearing aids digitally process incoming sounds. They make soft sounds more audible while keeping a limit on the overall output so that the volume isn't too loud.</p>



<p>Charlie was fitted with hearing aids that have a small instrument behind the ear connected to a domed earpiece in each canal. Dr. McCray explains that this style is comfortable for people who wear glasses like Charlie. They are also well-suited for the field he wanted to enter.</p>



<p>"Charlie needed something that would help him hear as clearly as possible in difficult environments with background noise," says Dr. McCray. "His hearing aids are the same model in each ear, but they are programmed differently based on his hearing loss."</p>



<p>Dr. McCray explains that some professions — including construction — increase the risk of hearing loss due to loud noises from equipment or instruments used. Some other examples include mechanics, truck drivers, farmers, factory workers, surgeons and dentists.</p>



<p>"If your employer requires hearing protection on the job, use it. Noisy hobbies, like woodworking, hunting and engine repairs, should also include hearing protection when sound levels are high," says Dr. McCray. "Hearing loss has an additive effect over a lifetime so preserving [hearing] early makes a difference."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving forward</h2>



<p>Two weeks after his initial appointment, Charlie got his new hearing aids. Dr. McCray completed the necessary paperwork and testing so he would clear the employment medical evaluation. He was hired by the TSA and began training.</p>



<p>In July, Charlie was selected to give the graduation address at the end of TSA training. He shared his speech with Dr. McCray at a follow-up appointment.</p>



<p>"It was really moving to know that all his effort and hard work had brought him to that grand conclusion," says Dr. McCray. "I am really proud of him."</p>



<p>Charlie says he is enjoying his new career at the airport and is grateful for the expertise of the Mayo Clinic Health System&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/audiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audiology</a>&nbsp;team.</p>



<p>"The work that Dr. McCray did was above and beyond to help make all this stuff come to fruition for me," he says. "She is like a master of her craft and knew exactly what we needed to do."</p>

<p>Water is essential to good health. Every cell, tissue and organ in your body needs water to work properly. Water is essential for maintaining your body temperature; lubricating and cushioning your joints; and getting rid of waste through urination, perspiration and bowel movements.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/symptoms-causes/syc-20354086?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dehydration</a> occurs when you use or lose more fluid than you take in, and your body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to carry out its normal functions. If you don't replace lost fluids, you will get dehydrated.</p>



<p>Thirst isn't always a reliable early indicator of the body's need for water. Many people don't feel thirsty until they're already dehydrated. That's why increasing water intake during hot weather or when you're ill is important.</p>



<p>Dehydration can lead to serious complications, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Heat injury.</strong><br>If you don't drink enough fluids when you're exercising vigorously and perspiring heavily, you may end up with a heat injury, ranging in severity from mild heat cramps to heat exhaustion or potentially life-threatening heatstroke.</li>



<li><strong>Urinary and kidney problems.</strong><br>Prolonged or repeated bouts of dehydration can cause urinary tract infections, kidney stones and even kidney failure.</li>



<li><strong>Seizures.</strong><br>Electrolytes — such as potassium and sodium — help carry electrical signals from cell to cell. If your electrolytes are out of balance, the normal electrical messages can become mixed up, which can lead to involuntary muscle contractions and sometimes to a loss of consciousness.</li>



<li><strong>Low blood volume shock (hypovolemic shock).</strong><br>This is one of the most serious, and sometimes life-threatening, complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Preventing dehydration</strong></h2>



<p>To prevent dehydration, drink plenty of fluids and eat foods high in water, such as fruits and vegetables. For most healthy people, letting thirst be your guide is an adequate daily guideline. Thirst isn't always a reliable indicator&nbsp;of hydration, though, because when you're thirsty, you already could be dehydrated.</p>



<p>But how much water do you need to drink every day? It's a simple question with no easy answer. Studies have produced varying recommendations over the years. The amount of water your body needs depends on many factors, including your health, how active you are and where you live.</p>



<p>You don't need to rely only on water to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meet your fluid needs</a>. What you eat also provides a significant portion. For example, many fruits and vegetables, such as watermelon and spinach, are almost 100% water by weight.</p>



<p>In addition, beverages such as milk, juice and herbal teas are composed mostly of water. Even caffeinated drinks — such as coffee and soda — can contribute to your daily water intake. But go easy on sugar-sweetened drinks. Regular soda, energy or sports drinks, and other sweet drinks usually contain a lot of added sugar, which may provide more calories than needed.</p>



<p>So how much fluid does the average, healthy adult living in a temperate climate need? The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine determined that an adequate daily fluid intake is:</p>



<ul>
<li>About 15.5 cups of fluids a day for men.</li>



<li>About 11.5 cups of fluids a day for women.</li>
</ul>



<p>These recommendations cover fluids from water, other beverages and food. About 20% of daily fluid intake usually comes from food and the rest from drinks.</p>

<p>The only effective <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354092?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> for dehydration is to replace lost fluids and lost electrolytes. The best approach to dehydration treatment depends on your age, the severity of dehydration and its cause.</p>



<p>Most adults with mild to moderate dehydration from diarrhea, vomiting or fever can improve their condition by drinking more water or other liquids. Diarrhea may be worsened by full-strength fruit juice and soft drinks.</p>



<p>If you work or exercise outdoors during hot or humid weather, cool water is your best bet. Sports drinks containing electrolytes and a carbohydrate solution also may be helpful.</p>



<p>Children and adults who are severely dehydrated should be treated by emergency personnel arriving in an ambulance or in a hospital emergency room. Salts and fluids delivered intravenously are absorbed quickly and speed recovery.</p>

<p>Rashes. They are common in young kids, especially babies.</p>



<p>"Hand, foot and mouth disease is spread through respiratory droplets," says Dr. Rajapakse. "It can also be spread through the stool of an infected person. That's why hand-washing is important. It can also be spread through fomites — touching something that an infected person has touched before. For that reason, we do see that it spreads pretty easily, especially in places where there's a lot of young children."</p>

<p>While highly contagious, the virus is usually mild.<br><br>"It can be quite painful and uncomfortable, especially the lesions of the back of the throat that can make it difficult to eat or drink," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>



<p>"If they're having a lot of pain or discomfort with the rash, you can give them ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help with that, and make sure that they're staying well-hydrated, drinking lots of fluids. Things like popsicles can help if they're having a sore throat," says Dr. Rajapakse.&nbsp;<br><br>There are no specific treatments, but there are things you can do to help your child feel better.&nbsp;<br><br>Seek medical attention if your child's signs or symptoms worsen after a few days.</p>

<p>When a simple hand movement, such as making a fist or moving the thumb, becomes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wrist-pain/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20366215">painful,</a> it could be from daily overuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"One of the most common is something called de Quervain's tenosynovitis," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>He says it's primarily a tendon problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If you think of the wrist, basically what we have here is that we have the tendons, which move your thumb. And they are covered by this band, and this is natural. We all have this, but in certain patients, they can have inflammation in this area," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>When the tendons underneath this band become inflamed, they can cause intense pain.</p>



<p>"Now, luckily, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/de-quervains-tenosynovitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371337">treatment</a> for this is relatively straightforward."</p>



<p>Hand therapy and wearing a splint may help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Sometimes we need to do a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cortisone-shots/about/pac-20384794?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">corticosteroid injection</a> to decrease inflammation, and most of the times, it gets better. But sometimes we need to do surgery," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>It's an outpatient procedure that involves opening the sheath surrounding the tendon to release pressure, and allow the tendons to glide more freely and pain-free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn., and REDMOND, Wash. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, a world leader in healthcare known for its commitment to innovation, is among the first healthcare organizations to deploy <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a>. This new generative AI service combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with organizational data from Microsoft 365 to enable new levels of productivity in the enterprise.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is testing the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/05/09/introducing-the-microsoft-365-copilot-early-access-program-and-new-capabilities-in-copilot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program</a> with hundreds of its clinical staff, doctors and healthcare workers.</p>



<p>“Microsoft 365 Copilot has the ability to transform work across virtually every industry so people can focus on the most important work and help move their organizations forward,” said Colette Stallbaumer, general manager, Microsoft 365. “We’re excited to be helping customers like Mayo Clinic achieve their goals.”</p>



<p>Generative AI has the potential to support Mayo Clinic’s vision to transform healthcare. For example, generative AI can help doctors automate form-filling tasks. Administrative demands continue to burden healthcare providers, taking up valuable time that could be used to provide more focused care to patients. Microsoft 365 Copilot has the potential to give healthcare providers valuable time back by automating tasks.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is one of the first to start working with Copilot tools to enable staff experience across apps like Microsoft Outlook, Word, Excel and more. Microsoft 365 Copilot combines the power of LLMs with data in the Microsoft 365 apps, including calendars, emails, chats, documents and meeting transcripts, to turn words into a powerful productivity tool.</p>



<p>“Privacy, ethics and safety are at the forefront of Mayo Clinic’s work with generative AI and large language models,” said Cris Ross, chief information officer at Mayo Clinic. “Using AI-powered tech will enhance Mayo Clinic’s ability to lead the transformation of healthcare while focusing on what matters most — providing the best possible care to our patients.”</p>



<p>As a leader in healthcare, Mayo Clinic is always looking for new ways to improve patient care. By using generative AI and LLMs, Mayo Clinic will be able to offer its teams new timesaving tools to help them succeed.</p>
