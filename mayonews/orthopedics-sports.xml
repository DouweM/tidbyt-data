<p>"The scientific name that we give it is adhesive capsulitis, and, basically, it's a condition when the shoulder gets tight and you can't move it very well," says Dr. Camp. </p>



<p>He says frozen shoulder happens when the lining that goes around the shoulder joint gets inflamed, possibly the result of a small injury. It thickens over time, forming scar tissue.</p>



<p>"Frozen shoulder exists in three stages, and the symptoms and treatment options depend on which stage you're in. So the first one is an inflammatory stage," says Dr. Camp.</p>



<p>That's the painful stage. Rest and steroid injections may help. The second stage is when the shoulder is less painful but starts to stiffen. Physical therapy works well then. The third phase …</p>



<p>"… is what we call thawing, which means it finally starts to relax, loosen up and gain motion back again," says Dr. Camp.</p>



<p>If it doesn't resolve in six to 12 months, surgery may be an option.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I was playing a pickup game of football with my kids, took a tumble, and my kneecap made a popping sound. It really hurt, then seemed to get better, but something's not right. Any idea what might be going on?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>If your kneecap pops or slides to the outside of your knee, you'll definitely know that something's going on. Typically, that "something" is a partial or full dislocation, which means the kneecap, also known as the patella, has slipped partly or all the way out of its groove over the knee joint.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-dislocation/basics/art-20056693?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Dislocation</a> can be caused by a sudden blow, such as taking a hard hit playing a contact sport like football or hockey, or by a chronic condition, such as a stretched ligament. Some people have a particular knee anatomy that makes it more common. In those cases, a dislocation could be caused by something as simple as normal walking or standing up from a chair. With chronic dislocation, it may feel as though your knee is buckling or giving way. There's often no pattern or regular causes of the dislocations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens when a kneecap dislocates?</strong></h2>



<p>When the <a href="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/condition/multi-ligament-injuries-knee-dislocation/">kneecap dislocates</a>, it's painful, and the knee area may swell. Whether it happens from an acute or chronic situation, dislocation can damage the cartilage of the groove that the kneecap sits in or the cartilage underneath the kneecap.</p>



<p>Acute or chronic dislocation indicates you have a stretched or torn medial patellofemoral ligament, or MPFL, a tough band of tissue that connects to the inside of the kneecap and prevents it from sliding to the outside of the knee.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treating acute dislocation</strong></h2>



<p>If the dislocation is caused by an acute injury, you may be able to ease the kneecap back into place, or you may need to go an emergency department where healthcare professionals can correct the dislocation and evaluate if there's additional injury to your knee. Following the dislocation, you should see an orthopedic specialist.</p>



<p>An X-ray provides an overall view of the anatomy of the kneecap and knee joint. The orthopedic specialist can determine if there is damage to the groove the kneecap rests in, how high the kneecap sits above the joint and if the patellar tendon, which connects below the kneecap, is pulling to one side.</p>



<p>If this is the first time your kneecap has dislocated, the X-ray also can help determine if you're at risk of it happening again. Your orthopedic specialist also may order an MRI to check if a piece of the cartilage has broken off.</p>



<p>Younger patients may need to undergo surgery to remove or fix a cartilage piece that has broken off and reconstruct the MPFL. Recovery following surgery typically involves wearing a brace, physical therapy and limited weight bearing to give the cartilage the best chance to heal. It may take up to six months before you're able to fully return to sports.</p>



<p>For older patients, cartilage is less likely to heal, so surgery isn't always recommended. However, if you're experiencing a catching sensation in your knee, an orthopedic surgeon may decide to surgically remove the piece of cartilage. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/physical-medicine-rehabilitation-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20467039?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Rehabilitation</a> will include limited weight bearing, using a brace and physical therapy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treating chronic dislocation</strong></h2>



<p>The first time your knee dislocates — unrelated to an injury — it may slide back into place on its own. However, you should see an orthopedic specialist who can evaluate if there has been any injury to the cartilage and determine your risk for dislocations happening again. If there isn't any cartilage damage, the orthopedic specialist may order physical therapy to strengthen your hip and quadricep muscles. This can help overcome any stretch in the MPFL ligament and stabilize your kneecap, as well as decrease the risk of arthritis over time.</p>



<p>However, you eventually still may require surgery to reconstruct the MPFL, as well as other procedures to correct chronic dislocations. These include deepening the groove where the kneecap sits or moving the location where the patellar tendon connects.</p>



<p>Recovery from MPFL reconstruction may take several months before you're able to return to normal activities and regain your range of motion. Overall recovery for more complex surgeries may take four to six months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preventing kneecap dislocations</strong></h2>



<p>The best way to lessen your chance of acute and chronic kneecap dislocations is to maintain overall leg, quadricep and hip strength. For chronic dislocations, learn what tends to cause them, such as twisting, and avoid those motions. A physical therapist also can work with you to improve overall leg strength and teach you how to correct a kneecap dislocation on your own.</p>



<p>For athletes who have suffered an acute dislocation, prompt care, possible surgery and rehabilitation can get you back to playing again. <em>— </em><strong><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/doug-bartels-md">Dr. Douglas Bartels</a>, Orthopedics &amp; Orthopedic Surgery, Sports Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire"><strong><em>Eau Claire, Wisconsin</em></strong></a></p>

<p>This Thanksgiving, don't let a poke, stab or slice prevent you and your family from enjoying turkey time.</p>



<p>"We see a lot of turkey-cutting injuries," Dr. Kakar says.</p>



<p>Thanksgiving is supposed to be a time dedicated to family, football and food, but too often, it turns into a day of finger and hand injuries.</p>



<p>"In terms of what happens is that people who aren't familiar with using a knife tend to do it, and their hand ... slips," Dr. Kakar says. "And if you actually think about how you're cutting, ... the knife can actually slip and puncture your hand."</p>



<p>Dr. Kakar sees patients who have injuries related to turkey carving that range from deep slices to cut tendons, and even fingers cut off.</p>



<p>"Well, I think the No. 1 risk factor is alcohol," he says.</p>



<p>So if you've been drinking, leave the carving to someone else.</p>



<p>"Another common cause for injuries is with distraction," he says. "So the whole family is gathered around. There's a lot of excitement. The turkey comes out, and one can be distracted when you're doing it."</p>



<p>That's why he recommends doing the carving in the kitchen away from distractions, then bringing the sliced turkey to the table.</p>



<p>Dr. Kakar's third tip comes from the fact that many people serve foods on Thanksgiving that they don't eat or prepare other times of the year. He's seen patients who tried to prepare a squash or some other vegetable, but didn't know the proper way to cut it. His recommendation is that if you don't know the proper way to cut something, just use it as a centerpiece on the dining room table.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (0:57) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post.&nbsp;Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."&nbsp;Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/10/Script-MCM-Weekend-Warrior-Exercising.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Exercise is key to a healthy lifestyle.</p>



<p>For those on a time crunch, stacking weekly exercise into a couple of days comes with the title "weekend warrior."</p>



<p>“Things like running, jogging, high-intensity workouts, ideally, the more that you can do, the better. People that did this, lowered mortality, lowered cardiovascular events," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>At least <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">150 minutes</a> of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous activity is recommended for adults each week.</p>



<p>"We don't expect people that have gone from a sedentary activity of not doing anything to jumping into 150 minutes a week. So taking days of break in between, assessing how your body responds to that activity," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>Repeating the same motions or ramping up too quickly could lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/overuse-injury/art-20045875?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overuse injuries</a>, inflammation and pain.</p>



<p>“If you take a couple days off and it's still persistent pain with daily activity — pain that keeps you up at night or keeps you from sleeping — these are all things that we typically recommend people coming in to be evaluated," he says.</p>

<p>Shoulder pain, weakness and range of motion loss can keep you from the activities you need and love to do, whether it's lifting boxes on the job, putting away dishes in the kitchen or hitting that powerful tennis serve.</p>



<p>Wear and tear, injury, certain medical conditions and age can take a toll on how your shoulder functions. Sometimes, the treatment is pretty straightforward, with options ranging from physical therapy to injections or surgery.</p>



<p>But other times, the condition of your shoulder has advanced beyond those options. Now, there are treatments designed especially for more advanced shoulder issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inserting a balloon for stabilization</h2>



<p>When a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rotator-cuff-injury/symptoms-causes/syc-20350225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rotator cuff tear </a>is so severe it can't be repaired, your orthopedic surgeon may use a subacromial balloon spacer. This small device is inserted into the space where the damaged rotator cuff lies using minimally invasive arthroscopic surgical techniques. Once in place, the device is inflated with saline to cushion and stabilize the joint.</p>



<p>After six to 12 months, the balloon dissolves. In the meantime, a physical therapist will help you retrain your muscles to move the shoulder using more optimal mechanics. Recovery tends to be faster since the tendons don't need to heal, as they would in traditional rotator cuff surgery. You can return to your daily activities with improved function, range of motion and less pain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3D printing for reverse shoulder replacement</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/shoulder-replacement/about/pac-20519121" target="_blank">Reverse shoulder replacement</a>&nbsp;is another surgical method for treating patients with severe arthritis, unrepairable rotator cuff tears or other damage. Basically, your surgeon changes the mechanics of the shoulder to allow other muscles to move it.</p>



<p>Since no shoulder is the same, how closely the replacement implant fits your shoulder's anatomy and how the implant is placed play key roles in the success of a reverse shoulder replacement. Your surgeon is able to choose from metal and plastic implants that are available in a few different shapes and a range of sizes. A 3D-printed model of your shoulder can help your orthopedic surgeon precisely place the implant.</p>



<p>The process begins with a CT scan before surgery to create a 3D model of your shoulder on a computer. This allows your surgeon to see how the implant should be placed, how to preserve as much bone as possible and how to identify the best way to secure the implant. A 3D guide is printed that duplicates the template from the computer.</p>



<p>During surgery, your surgeon places the 3D guide on the bone so the implant can be placed precisely as planned.</p>



<p>3D modeling also helps your surgeon determine if you need a customized implant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Creating a customized 3D implant</h2>



<p>In most cases, your surgeon can choose a standard implant that will give you the shoulder function you need. But for some patients, their anatomy or bone damage won't allow a standard implant to fit appropriately. An implant that doesn't fit well can fail, leading to more surgery.</p>



<p>In these cases, an implant can be created to precisely fit a patient. Using a computer-generated 3D model, the custom implant designed for the patient is printed using the same materials as a standard implant. While this is only being used in special cases, it may become the standard in time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wider spectrum of customized treatments</h2>



<p>There are new options to provide a wide spectrum of treatments for patients with advanced shoulder issues. Having multiple options allows your orthopedic surgeon to choose the one that targets your specific issues to achieve the best outcome.</p>

<p>Dr. Sierra wants to set the record straight about aging and joint replacements.</p>



<p>"The perception out there is that everybody's going to need a hip replacement down the road, whether it's knee or hip, everybody's going to need some form of replacement. That's not necessarily true," he says.</p>



<p>He says it's not aging but anatomy that will predispose people to knee or hip replacements down the road.</p>



<p>"This is a perfect example. This a patient that had a slip when they were very young. See, there's an abnormal shape to the femur. And this abnormal shape will cause damage of this affected bone into the socket that would lead to hip arthritis," says Dr. Sierra.</p>



<p>Joint replacements today are more successful than ever — thanks to precision robotic surgery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When people retire, they often plan to spend more time with their grandkids, or on activities like volunteering, gardening, traveling and hobbies. Christine Brown came up with something far more epic.</p>



<p>After thinking about what she and her husband, Tom, enjoyed doing together, she proposed that they spend the next five years hiking the 2,190 miles of the <a href="https://appalachiantrail.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Appalachian Trail</a> (AT). Stretching from Springer Mountain, Georgia, to Katahdin, Maine, it's the longest hiking-only trail in the world.</p>



<p>Tom's response was, "Absolutely!"</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Retirement challenge: Tackling the Appalachian Trail</h2>



<p>So in 2018, the La Crosse, Wisconsin, couple laced up their boots, hoisted their backpacks, grabbed their hiking sticks and headed north from the trail's southernmost point. Their five-year plan called for hiking the Appalachian Trail in 400- to 550-mile segments. That schedule meant 12 to 18 miles per day over rough terrain, up and down mountains through all kinds of weather, from sweltering heat to snow and sleet. According to the Browns, that breaks down to 30,000 to 40,000 steps a day.</p>



<p>"It's a physical challenge, but it's also a mental challenge," says Tom. "Some days, you see quite a few hikers; on other days, you're completely alone. Some days, the hiking is challenging, and some days you're walking down a small town's Main Street. You meet people of all backgrounds and ages on the AT. The hikers become a community and are always willing to help each other."</p>



<p>Even before the start of their epic trek, Tom, 63, had been experiencing pain in his right knee brought on by years of work at his excavating and snowplowing business. He'd undergone hyaluronate injections to relieve the pain and help the joint move more smoothly. Those treatments meant the pain wasn't enough to delay or trim back their plan.</p>



<p>Then came May 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A slippery stone leads to surgery</h2>



<p>Christine, whose trail name is Beanbuster, and Tom, whose trail name is Traverse, were hiking the Appalachian Trail as it wove through the Green Mountains of Vermont. It was a drizzly day. They were climbing up a mountain, and the stones underfoot were slippery. A stone shifted, and Tom felt something stretch and pop: the Achilles tendon in his right leg.</p>



<p>The couple worked their way to a hotel, began icing the tendon and contacted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/james-mannion-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Mannion, M.D.</a>, Tom's&nbsp;Family Medicine&nbsp;physician in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Crosse</a>, for advice on caring for the injury. The Browns decided to head home and a few days later, Tom's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/achilles-tendon-rupture/symptoms-causes/syc-20353234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Achilles tendon ruptured</a>. Repairing the tendon now took precedence over his aching, arthritic knee.</p>



<p>To address this critical injury, which turned out to be particularly complicated, Tom reached out to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/charles-nolte-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Nolte, D.O.</a>, his long-time&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/orthopedic-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">orthopedics specialist</a>, who practices at Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/onalaska" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onalaska</a>, Wisconsin.</p>



<p>"This wasn't just an Achilles rupture," Dr. Nolte says. "Tom had a completely calcified tendon, probably due to an earlier injury. We had to perform a complex reconstruction of the tendon, which involved cutting out much of it, then reconnecting it."</p>



<p>Dr. Nolte says they weren't sure if the tendon would heal, much less heal well enough for Tom to return to the trail. Dr. Nolte told Tom it would be a slow recovery. But Tom tackled his rehabilitation and recovery with the same can-do spirit as he tackled the trail with Christine.</p>



<p>"At one point, there was no guarantee if the surgery would hold, if I'd have a drop foot or get my range of motion back," he says. "The physical therapists knew I wanted to be back on the AT by May 2023, so they set up a program that focused on strength, range of motion and stretching the tendon. They kept me on track and didn't let me get ahead of my healing."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time to address chronic pain</h2>



<p>After six months of recovery from the Achilles rupture, it was time to start phase two of Tom's plan to get back to the trail: a total <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/knee-replacement/about/pac-20385276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replacement of his right knee</a>.</p>



<p>"Tom had dealt with his arthritic right knee for years and undergone nonoperative treatments to relieve the pain," says Dr. Nolte. "We planned to do a total knee replacement during his off-season from the trail, but then the Achilles rupture happened."</p>



<p>In February, Dr. Nolte performed a robotic-assisted total knee replacement of Tom's right knee.</p>



<p>"The robot takes a really good, successful procedure and makes it better," says Dr. Nolte. "The accuracy of cuts and component alignment are close to perfect, which reduces pain and speeds recovery."</p>



<p>Dr. Nolte adds that after completing about 300 robotic-assisted total knee replacements, he's seen a considerable difference in the postoperative recovery phase, with patients getting back more quickly to what they love to do.</p>



<p>Once again after surgery, Tom went into aggressive rehabilitation mode, following the plan of his&nbsp;physical therapists, and buying an exercise bike to continue building strength and range of motion at home. His goal was to be back on the Appalachian Trail by early May.</p>



<p>"I want to thank Dr. Nolte and my physical therapists,&nbsp;for all they did to help me reach my goals," Tom says. "They were amazing."</p>



<p>Dr. Nolte also credits Tom with doing the hard work to get better.</p>



<p>"Tom's a highly motivated patient. He did physical therapy before and after both surgeries, and followed his recovery plans," says Dr. Nolte. "Christine is a real go-getter, and he wanted to make sure he could keep up with her."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Postcards to the hometown care team</h2>



<p>On May 5, almost one year to the day since his Achilles injury and less than three months since his knee replacement, Tom and Christine were back hiking a grueling 400-mile segment of the Appalachian Trail, including summiting 6,288-foot-high Mount Washington in New Hampshire's White Mountains during a snow and sleet storm.</p>



<p>"We had two weeks of nice weather," says Christine, "followed by five-and-a-half weeks of rain."</p>



<p>Despite the weather and continual up-and-down mountain climbing, Christine noticed a difference in Tom.</p>



<p>"He had been in pain for a long time with that knee. Pain is insidious, and affects you physically and mentally," she says. "It was great having my cheerful, good-humored husband back."</p>



<p>Throughout their 2023 trek of the trail, Christine sent postcards to Dr. Nolte. He shared the cards with his team members, who took pride and satisfaction in Tom's accomplishments. While the scenes on the cards varied, the message was always the same: "Dear Dr. Frankenstein-Nolte. Your surgery was such a success that you've created a monster. My husband sees a mountain, wants to climb it and makes me go with him. I'm cold and tired. Make him stop. Christine."</p>



<p>Christine will get her wish in June 2024 when she and Tom reach Katahdin, Maine, and officially complete the last 170-mile segment of their epic trek. To mark making it to the trail's end, they're planning to fly family members to Bar Harbor, Maine, for a grand finale celebration of their great adventure on the Appalachian Trail.</p>

<p>There are plenty of frights to go around on Halloween, but a hand injury probably isn't one you'd expect.</p>



<p>"Interestingly, it's the fourth busiest holiday for hand injuries," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kakar-sanjeev-sanj-m-d/bio-20055340?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Sanj Kakar</a>, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic hand and wrist surgeon.</p>



<p>Dr. Kakar says almost one-third of those Halloween hand injuries are among kids 10 to 14. And most of them happen when people are carving pumpkins.</p>

<p>"It's primarily stabbing injuries where the knife may slip, and, so, they can cut things like tendons, which are the ropes that help move your hands," Dr. Kakar says. "But they can also break bones, and also they can burn themselves, as well, with candles."</p>



<p>But Dr. Kakar says most of the injuries are avoidable.</p>



<p>"A lot of people might just go to the kitchen and grab a sharp knife. But there's good studies out there showing that actual pumpkin-specific carving knives [are safer], [because] actually the force needed to injure yourself, is higher if you use one of those than if you use a standard knife," he says. "So I would use a pumpkin carving kit, No. 1."</p>



<p>No. 2, Dr. Kakar says, is to let kids handle designing the jack-o'-lantern, but make sure adults do all of the carving.</p>



<p>And No. 3, make sure you're always supporting the pumpkin with your noncutting hand.</p>



<p>"So if you're right-handed, use your left hand to support the pumpkin and carve from the top down as opposed to the bottom up," Dr. Kakar says. "It's very easy for the knife to slip and go into your hand."</p>

<p><br>Damage to these nerves needs to be cared for in a timely manner to avoid problems. Dr. Noland says if too much time has passed, then the options become more limited for repair and reconstruction.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment options</h3>



<p>The most common&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brachial-plexus-injury/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350241?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surgical options</a>&nbsp;are nerve reconstruction, nerve repair, nerve grafting and nerve transfers.<br></p>



<p>"We treat brachial plexus injuries primarily through the use of what's called a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brachial-plexus-injury/multimedia/nerve-transfer/img-20008552?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerve transfer</a>. And a nerve transfer can be thought of as rewiring the injured nerves with good nerves that are nearby and functioning, but also expendable," says Dr. Noland.<br><br>Postoperative rehabilitation or physical therapy are crucial to healing.<br><br>"That includes what I like to think of as rewiring the brain and training the brain for the new function. So essentially training one nerve to perform the function of another nerve," she says.</p>

<p>When a simple hand movement, such as making a fist or moving the thumb, becomes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wrist-pain/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20366215">painful,</a> it could be from daily overuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"One of the most common is something called de Quervain's tenosynovitis," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>He says it's primarily a tendon problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If you think of the wrist, basically what we have here is that we have the tendons, which move your thumb. And they are covered by this band, and this is natural. We all have this, but in certain patients, they can have inflammation in this area," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>When the tendons underneath this band become inflamed, they can cause intense pain.</p>



<p>"Now, luckily, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/de-quervains-tenosynovitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371337">treatment</a> for this is relatively straightforward."</p>



<p>Hand therapy and wearing a splint may help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Sometimes we need to do a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cortisone-shots/about/pac-20384794?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">corticosteroid injection</a> to decrease inflammation, and most of the times, it gets better. But sometimes we need to do surgery," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>It's an outpatient procedure that involves opening the sheath surrounding the tendon to release pressure, and allow the tendons to glide more freely and pain-free.&nbsp;</p>
