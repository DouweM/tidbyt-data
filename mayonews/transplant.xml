<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — People who are overall healthy and living with well-controlled Type 2 diabetes can donate a kidney, thanks to a change in national policy.</p>

<p>"This policy change may offer a lifeline to some people with end-stage kidney disease, providing them with a better chance for a successful transplant and improved quality of life," he says.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mao-Shennen-A.-MD_15143457_201809121253-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-382857" style="width:192px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mao-Shennen-A.-MD_15143457_201809121253-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mao-Shennen-A.-MD_15143457_201809121253.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Shennen Mao, M.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Nearly 89,000 people in the U.S. are on the waiting list for a potentially lifesaving kidney transplant, according to the <a href="https://unos.org/data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing</a>. The average wait for a kidney from a deceased donor is three to five years. People who receive kidneys from living donors also tend to have better outcomes, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shennen Mao, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon.</p>



<p>"People in need of a kidney transplant typically receive a living donor transplant much faster than a deceased donor transplant, avoiding many years of dialysis and its associated complications," Dr. Mao says. "On average, kidneys from living donors also last longer than those from deceased donors."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What led to policy change?</h2>



<p>Historically, people with diabetes have been prohibited from being living kidney donors because diabetes can <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-nephropathy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354562?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cause kidney disease.</a> People with Type 1 diabetes remain ineligible to be a living kidney donor. By expanding eligibility criteria, there's potential to save more lives through increased kidney availability while maintaining a commitment to the safety and well-being of donors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the policy?</h2>



<p>The national policy allows people with Type 2 diabetes to donate a kidney if there is no evidence of organ damage or an unacceptable lifetime risk of complications. Mayo Clinic Transplant Center adopted its own more stringent policies to minimize potential risks for the donor. In addition to national criteria, Mayo Clinic patients with Type 2 diabetes also must meet the following criteria to be a donor:</p>



<ul>
<li>Be age 60 or older.</li>



<li>Have well-controlled diabetes and not use insulin.</li>



<li>If over age 65, can be using up to two oral medications for diabetes.</li>



<li>Not be overweight.</li>



<li>Have no family history of kidney disease.</li>



<li>Undergo a rigorous health assessment and individualized risk evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Mayo Clinic donors undergo thorough health evaluations and risk assessments, ensuring that only those with minimal risk of complications are approved to donate," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/budhiraja-pooja-m-b-b-s/bio-20486288?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pooja Budhiraja, M.B.B.S.</a>, Mayo Clinic nephrologist. "Criteria such as age limits, weight requirements and the absence of a family history of kidney disease help mitigate the long-term health risks for donors. Our commitment is to safeguard donor health while expanding transplant possibilities."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic will also conduct ongoing research to monitor and assess the effect of these policy changes on the long-term outcomes of older living kidney donors with Type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Every eight minutes, a person is added to the national kidney transplant waiting list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Unfortunately, in this country, there is a large gap between the demand for kidney transplantation and the supply of organs from deceased donors," says Dr. Issa.Dialysis is an option for patients with end-stage kidney disease. Though Dr. Issa says a transplant is preferred — and having a living donor is best.</p>

<p>"Kidney transplantation offers greater survival benefits and increases the lifespan of people in need of kidney transplant," he says.</p>



<p>And that's a reason why it's important to expand the eligible kidney donor pool.</p>



<p>"Allowing people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus may open the door for some people who have not been eligible before to be potential living kidney donors," Dr. Issa says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Criteria for a living kidney donor with Type 2 diabetes </h3>



<p>Those eligible must be older than 60, have well-controlled Type 2 diabetes, not on insulin and have no family history of kidney disease.</p>



<p>"Any potential individual who would like to be a candidate for living kidney donation should undergo a very thorough health assessment and very thorough examination to ensure they are healthy enough," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>It's about safeguarding the potential donor's overall health — while helping close the gap.</p>

<p>Lisa Brown, 53, of Jacksonville, suffered from severe pelvis and back pain for years. She later learned that her bladder wasn't working due to follicular cystitis, a rare and non-specific inflammatory disease of the bladder, and inflammatory pseudotumor of the bladder. In 2017, her bladder was removed using robotic-assisted surgery and replaced with a "neobladder" that was attached to her ureters, which are the tubes that carry urine produced by the kidneys. Unfortunately, ongoing challenges with her bladder caused permanent damage to her kidneys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I had recurring bladder infections to where my kidneys started backing up," says Lisa. "I’d been in late-stage kidney failure since 2018."</p>



<p>Lisa had nephrostomy tubes for more than a year that had to be exchanged every six weeks until her ureters were surgically repaired in 2019. She has also had to have iron infusions periodically because of low kidney function, and battled extreme fatigue, continued low back pain, anemia, and a feeling of constantly being cold. Her nephrologist referred her to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> to be considered for a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Michelle-and-Lisa3-original-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-381688" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Michelle-and-Lisa3-original-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Michelle-and-Lisa3-original-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Michelle-and-Lisa3-original.jpg 810w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></figure></div>


<p>After Lisa qualified for a transplant, her cousin, Michelle Tatum, was tested as a match and stepped up to be her donor.</p>



<p>"My decision to donate wasn't made lightly, but I will say it was made easily," says Michelle. "I truly believe God gave me two kidneys when I only need one for this exact purpose." Lisa received her new kidney on Jan. 25, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I love Lisa with all my heart," says Michelle, reflecting on what inspired her to become an organ donor. "I watched her health decline over the last five years. I decided to get tested and see if I could donate and said that if it was God's plan, it would all work out, and it did, perfectly. I was raised in a way where generosity and kindness toward others are celebrated and encouraged. I can’t change the world, but I can change one person’s world."</p>



<p>This <a href="https://donatelife.net/how-you-can-help/national-observances-celebrations/national-donor-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Donor Day</a>, an annual observance dedicated to spreading awareness and education about organ, eye and tissue donation, Michelle hopes others will also consider being living donors.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="218" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Michelle-and-Lisa7-original-218x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-381691" style="width:182px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Michelle-and-Lisa7-original-218x300.jpg 218w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Michelle-and-Lisa7-original.jpg 582w" sizes="(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px" /></figure></div>


<p>"I would definitely encourage others to get tested and consider becoming organ donors," says Michelle. "I have been blessed with a deeper meaning and greater purpose in my life. Some people have thanked me for what I did, but to me, the gifts I received were much greater than the ones I gave."</p>



<p>Lisa shares that her kidney function is perfect now.</p>



<p>"I’m so excited about life again and am truly thankful for my donor," Lisa says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Harley’s fight to survive</strong></h2>



<p>Being together as a family has a deeper meaning for the Duffer family this Valentine’s day. In 2021, Harley suffered <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/clinical-trial-finds-cell-therapy-improves-quality-of-life-in-advanced-heart-failure/">heart failure</a> stemming from a rare genetic condition. He says doctors told him his only chance for survival was to get a heart transplant. </p>



<p>“I was basically on my deathbed,” says Harley. “They told me I had six months to live.” Doctors also told Harley the transplant would be the hardest thing he’s ever done in his whole life. </p>



<p>Harley says he had to fight to survive for his family.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The wait for a heart donor</strong></h2>



<p>Harley was placed in a medically induced coma at Mayo Clinic to minimize damage to his heart while waiting for a donor organ to become available. Each passing day took its toll on the family.</p>



<p>"There were several instances where the fear of him not making it through set in very heavy. And then you have a daughter at home saying ‘Where’s daddy? Where’s daddy?’ It was a lot to go through,” remembers Justine.</p>



<p>The Duffers got the call they were hoping for - a donor heart was available. Harley underwent a successful transplant and began his long road to recovery. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="922" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Harley-leaving-hospital-1-922x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-381874" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Harley-leaving-hospital-1-922x1024.jpg 922w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Harley-leaving-hospital-1-270x300.jpg 270w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Harley-leaving-hospital-1-768x853.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Harley-leaving-hospital-1-1383x1536.jpg 1383w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Harley-leaving-hospital-1-1845x2048.jpg 1845w" sizes="(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Harley Duffer leaving Mayo Clinic after his successful heart transplant</strong><br><strong> (photo courtesy: Duffer Family)</strong></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Heartfelt gratitude</strong></h2>



<p>After regaining his health, Harley got the chance to do something he never expected. He was given the opportunity to meet the family of his organ donor, Peyton Nurse.</p>



<p>Both families got together and listened to Peyton’s heart beating healthy and strong in Harley’s chest. </p>



<p>“I could not have asked for a better donor family. They are so caring and welcoming,” says Harley. “I understand they are going through a loss, but I want to be here for them. They are just the best kinds of people.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Remembering the life and legacy of Peyton Nurse </strong></h2>



<p>Peyton is remembered as a loving son, a brother, a friend to all, and a star student who always sought to help others in his community. He tragically lost his life in a car accident. His last wish was to be an organ donor. Peyton’s heart became the gift of life for Harley. </p>



<p>“We went to see Peyton’s resting place,” says Harley. “Such bravery and selflessness from a young man. I just want to say thank you to Peyton’s family, for your son’s bravery and the sacrifices he’s made.”</p>

<p>Harley and Justine are now back at home with their daughter, Libi, and their newborn baby girl. With their hearts full of love and gratitude, and the hope to carry on the legacy of their heart donor, they named their new baby girl, Peyton. </p>



<p>“We want her to know the importance of organ donation, and that’s why her daddy is still here, to raise his girls, and be here with us all together,” says Justine. </p>

<p>Carrying on the legacy of her son’s name means the world to his mom Lesley. “I can’t wait to hold baby Peyton in person and hold her in my arms,” shares Lesley. The name “Peyton” holds a special place in her heart because not only was it her son’s name, but a name that was handed down for several generations in her family.  </p>



<p>Lesley shared these two pictures as a Valentine’s Day message to serve as a reminder of the power of love, legacy and the gift of life. </p>

<p>In addition to celebrating 60 years as a leader in organ transplant practice, Mayo Clinic is also celebrating a record year in the number of transplants performed. Mayo Clinic, as the largest integrated transplant center in the country represented by sites in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota, performed a collective 1,987 organ transplants in 2023. Transplant volumes not only exceeded previous records held by Mayo Clinic, but also those of other national transplant programs. Since the organ transplant practice began with the first <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777">kidney transplant</a> on Nov. 25, 1963, more than 31,000 lifesaving organ transplants have been performed at Mayo Clinic.  </p>



<p>"As we celebrate the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Mayo Clinic's transplant programs, we are also celebrating a record number of transplants," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heimbach-julie-k-m-d/bio-20054676">Julie Heimbach, M.D.</a>, chair of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891">Transplant Center at Mayo Clinic</a> in Rochester, Minnesota.&nbsp;"Working together across our three destination transplant centers, we have made remarkable progress in patient care which has led to excellent post-transplant outcomes for patients. We have also developed innovative patient care protocols that make transplantation possible even for the most complex patients. We remain focused on the primary value of Mayo Clinic, which is that the needs of the patient come first."</p>



<p>Each of Mayo Clinic's three destination campuses has a large volume and highly successful transplant program. Altogether, Mayo Clinic currently has the largest liver, kidney and heart transplant programs in the country. <em></em></p>



<p>This success can be attributed to several factors, including consistent communication and collaboration between sites, as well as collective expertise-sharing best practices. Each site's transplant program continues to push the limit on ways to increase the availability of organs for transplantation while providing high-quality patient care.<em></em></p>



<p>“When others say no, we say yes," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093">Bashar Aqel, M.D.</a>, chair of the Transplant Center at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. "It is not easy at all to become a Category of One. With a passion to do more, to be better every day and unparalleled teamwork, we have achieved that distinction."</p>

<p>While performing more organ transplants in 2023 than in any previous year, team physicians and researchers continue to look to the future of organ transplants. The Transforming Transplant strategic initiative aims to transform the field through research and innovation by redefining standards of care for patients in organ failure. The Transplant Specialty Council and Transplant Research Center also are making plans to begin a Transplant Outcomes and Policy Initiative<em> — </em>a structure to invest in data science and build expertise in policy development — in 2024.</p>



<p>“Transplant is a highly complex clinical practice that requires a high degree of coordination throughout the patient journey," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935">Burcin Taner, M.D.</a>, chair of the Transplant Specialty Council and Transplant Center at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "The growing volume of transplants at Mayo Clinic is the ultimate testament that our patients trust our collective expertise. Our successes will spring us to the future in which we envision Mayo Clinic playing an even bigger role in shaping the future of organ transplant globally.”</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> A co-worker was diagnosed with kidney disease last year. He is now on dialysis three times a week as he waits for a kidney transplant. He shared his hope to get a living donor, explaining that he will have a longer wait since there are not as many diverse people signed up as organ donors. Can you explain why this is and what can I do to help?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> </p>



<p>More than 103,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for an organ transplant, according to the <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/view-data-reports/national-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network</a>. Nearly 60% of people on <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=27#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of,percent%20of%20white%20living%20donors.">transplant waiting lists</a> come from minority communities.</p>



<p>Higher rates of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are present in minority communities, contributing to more kidney failure. Almost 89,000 people are waiting for a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/kidney-transplant/home/orc-20203197">kidney transplant</a>.</p>



<p>Though organs are not matched based on race and ethnicity, certain criteria, including blood type&nbsp;and specific antibodies, must be matched to find a compatible organ. People from various ethnic groups will have a better outcome with a donor organ from someone of a similar background.</p>



<p>In general, wait times in the U.S. to receive a deceased donor kidney vary based on region, but can be anywhere from three years up to 10 years. Only about 30% of donor organs are from people of color, so diverse organs are less available.</p>



<p>So, unfortunately, your colleague is correct in that he would likely have a longer wait time for a transplant if waiting on a deceased donor. Finding a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-transplant/about/pac-20384787?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">living kidney donor</a> is often a faster route to transplant.</p>



<p>Kidney donation is the most common type of living-donor transplant. Donors give one of their two healthy kidneys to the recipient. People only need one kidney to live a healthy, active life. In 2022, more than 6,400 lives were saved thanks to the generosity of living donors, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://donatelife.net/donation/types/living-donation/">Donate Life America.</a></p>



<p>However, there is a long-standing distrust of the healthcare community in certain minority groups, and many myths have been propagated about the process around organ donation, which has resulted in people being less likely to become organ donors.</p>



<p>Some of the common things I hear from patients include:</p>



<p><strong>Myth: If I agree to donate my organs upon death, the hospital staff won't work as hard to save my life.</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Fact:</strong> People who are organ donors will be cared for if they are in the hospital as any other person. When you go to the hospital for treatment, the healthcare team will focus on providing care for you to save your life until your injury or condition is determined to be nonrecoverable. A transplant team will not become involved before your condition is deemed as unsurvivable.</p>



<p><strong>Myth: People who donate organs or tissues can't have an open-casket funeral.</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Fact:</strong>&nbsp;Donors' bodies are treated with care and respect. And they're dressed for burial. No one can see that they donated organs or tissues.</p>



<p><strong>Myth:</strong>&nbsp;I'm too old to donate. Nobody would want my organs.</p>



<p><strong>Fact:</strong>&nbsp;There's no defined cutoff age for donating organs. The decision to use your organs is based on strict medical criteria, not age. Don't prematurely disqualify yourself. Let the doctors decide at the time of your death whether your organs and tissues are suitable for transplantation.</p>



<p><strong>Myth: My family will be charged if I donate my organs after death.</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Fact:</strong>&nbsp;The organ donor's family never pays for their donation. The donor family pays for all the medical care once you are determined to be a possible donor. Sometimes, families think those costs are for organ donation. But the person who gets the organs for transplant pays the costs for removing the organs.</p>



<p><strong>Myth: Becoming a living donor is a lengthy and costly process. </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Fact: Anyone interested in becoming a living donor will have to </strong>undergo online screening and an in-depth physical and psychological evaluation process to ensure they are a good candidate for donation. The recipient's insurance always covers the cost. However, there are some programs available to compensate potential donors for time lost from work or school or to help with travel or dependent care expenses. Once a donor is approved, the timeframe is up to the donor, recipient and the respective care teams.</p>



<p><strong>Myth: Being a living donor will shorten my life span.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Fact: Most healthy people can live with only one kidney. </strong>We expect a person to live a full and normal life following their donation. At Mayo Clinic, we have living donors who have gone on to do incredible athletic feats, including climbing Kilimanjaro, running marathons and having children.<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Myth: As a living donor, I must be on medication for the rest of my life. </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Fact: </strong>Living donors do not have any long-term medication requirements after donation.</p>



<p><strong>Myth: </strong>I can only be a living donor if I'm a match for someone.</p>



<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Even if someone wants to be a donor for a relative or friend but is found to be incompatible, they can still donate as part of a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/paired-donation/overview/ovc-20508454?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">paired kidney donation chain</a>. This process allows two or more donors to be matched with appropriate recipients in an exchange.</p>



<p>You can help your colleague by sharing information about organ donation and encouraging others – particularly those with diverse backgrounds – to consider becoming donors. It truly is a gift of life. Go to the <a href="https://donatelife.net/">Donate Life America</a> website to learn more about signing up to be an organ donor. —<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463"><strong><em>Dr. Shennen Mao</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Transplant Center, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide by Dec. 8 on a&nbsp;new therapy to treat sickle cell disease using gene editing technology called&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2018/07/24/the-gene-editing-tool-crispr-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CRISPR</a>, which stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.</p>



<p>Approximately 250 million people worldwide carry the gene for sickle cell disease. It affects those with roots in Africa, Spanish-speaking regions in the Western Hemisphere, Saudi Arabia, India and Mediterranean countries. In the U.S., sickle cell disease is most common in the African American community.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Genetics</h3>



<p>"Sickle cell disease is a genetic, inherited disorder. It's caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for hemoglobin," says Dr. Ferdjallah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a baby to be born with the disease, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene.</p>



<p>The normally flexible red blood cells turn into rigid crescent shapes — sickle cells— that get stuck in blood vessels. And that can cause problems down the line.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="731" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Sickle-Cell-Red-cell-illustration-original-1024x731.jpg" alt="Medical illustration of sickle cell next to red cell" class="wp-image-378212" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Sickle-Cell-Red-cell-illustration-original-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Sickle-Cell-Red-cell-illustration-original-300x214.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Sickle-Cell-Red-cell-illustration-original-768x549.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Sickle-Cell-Red-cell-illustration-original-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Sickle-Cell-Red-cell-illustration-original.jpg 1575w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Medical illustration of a typical red blood cell next to a sickle cell</figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Screening </h3>



<p>"Fortunately, in the United States, every baby, as part of their newborn screen, is screened for sickle cell disease," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>



<p>Babies may not show symptoms until 5 or 6 months, with pain or swelling in the fingertips. And then, later in life,&nbsp;Dr. Ferdjallah says patients experience, "Pain in the extremities, in the back. It's all caused by those sickle cells being stuck in the blood vessels."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risks</h3>



<p>Along with pain, the risks for heart and kidney damage and stroke are increased.</p>



<p>"Some of our patients actually experienced stroke, or what we call silent strokes, from the sickle cells actually getting stuck and creating a blockage in the cerebral vessels," Dr. Ferdjallah says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That's why it's important to work with patients early on and regularly.</p>



<p>"The earlier you go to curative therapy, the better," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>

<p>When David Elder’s back started to hurt in the fall of 2022, he thought his recurrent spasms had returned. But when medication didn’t help like before, his doctor sent him to the ER – and soon after, he was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>, a treatable but incurable form of cancer that had caused several painful breaks in his spine.</p>



<p>“It just hit us out of nowhere,” he says of the diagnosis. “It was shocking.”</p>



<p>Five months earlier, in May, his routine bloodwork had come back normal, says Marcia, his wife of 38 years.</p>



<p>By October, David was fighting for his life.</p>



<p>Twenty years earlier, he had <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donated a kidney</a> to his cousin, and now cancer was attacking the remaining kidney, rendering him vulnerable.</p>



<p>David spent nine days at Baptist Hospital South in Jacksonville, Fla., where they rescued his kidney, but this triumph marked the beginning of his journey rather than the end.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>‘Mayo is right here’</strong></h2>



<p>The Elders live in St. Augustine, a northeast Florida community where David has been a worship pastor at Anastasia Baptist Church for 18 years. St. Augustine is about a half hour's drive from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida.</a></p>

<p>“It took a little bit of a mind adjustment to realize, OK, this is cancer, and it's a serious type of cancer. But, you know, Mayo is right here, and people move from other states to be here,” David says. “It was a no-brainer to just come here and get the process started.”</p>



<p>The months to come would include more doctor visits, and in February David received a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant using his own bone marrow</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>Following surgery, he was told that he was a good candidate for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hospital-at-home/sections/overview/ovc-20551797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s Advanced Care at Home program</a>, which would allow him to heal at home, with Marcia by his side and a clinician just a video call away, day or night.</p>



<p>The Elders jumped at the chance.</p>



<p>Studies have shown that 90 percent of patients who receive care through Advanced Care at Home rate their satisfaction with the program as five out of five. In addition, compared to those who received hospital care, home healthcare patients had a 50 percent decrease in readmissions.</p>



<p>“The only time I left him was during the transplant when they wouldn’t let me in the room,” says Marcia, who provided David’s round-the-clock care at home. “What a blessing it was to be in our house.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No place like home</strong></h2>



<p>With Advanced Care at Home, an initiative of <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform</a>, patients like David can receive high-acuity care at home, thanks to modern technology and a home-services care team that visits in person at least twice daily and is available 24/7.</p>



<p>Advanced Care at Home teams collaborate to provide at-home care to patients in Jacksonville, Fla., Phoenix, Ariz., and northwest Wisconsin.</p>



<p>A patient’s physician decides if they could benefit from the program with the aid of two artificial intelligence-based algorithms that provide a “fit score” derived from historical home hospital admissions data.</p>



<p>Just a few hours after David’s transplant, he and Marcia learned that he was a candidate for the program. By 6:30 p.m. that same evening, they were back home. And ten minutes after they got there, the medical transport team arrived with all the supplies they needed.</p>



<p>David had been in the hospital for fewer than three days.</p>



<p>At home David could have familiar foods and drinks, watch his favorite channels, and read his own magazines and books. With more furniture at home than in the hospital, he could find a position that didn’t hurt his back as much during his waking hours. And at night, he got more and better-quality sleep without the constant beeping and frequent interruptions common in hospitals.</p>



<p>“It's not infrequent that patients tell me that they didn’t get a good night of sleep in the hospital, or that it’s triggered their stress and anxiety, or it’s made their pain worse, or that the bed was uncomfortable,” says Patricia Chipi, M.D., a hospital medicine physician at Mayo Clinic in Florida who works with Advanced Care at Home.</p>



<p>“With Advanced Care at Home, those concerns are much less. In fact, patients are typically saying, ‘I slept great last night, and I'm starting to feel so much better,’” Dr. Chipi says.</p>



<p>Being near loved ones, too, provides a healing balm for patients at home.</p>



<p>David and Marcia’s two sons and their families are based in Florida and were able to visit during his recovery. When they came over, David would position his chair with a clear line of sight to the toy corner, where their five grandkids would gather to play.</p>



<p>For Marcia, playing an active role in her husband’s daily care was a challenge that provided comfort, too.</p>



<p>“It’s so much better. … At home, there is something I can do, versus at the hospital, where I just have to sit and watch other people do,” she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Something old, something new</strong></h2>



<p>In the Mayo Clinic tradition, home healthcare harks back to the household visits that the Mayo brothers provided to patients in the past.</p>



<p>“It's a different way of getting better. It reflects on what we did 100 years ago, when people would heal at home,” says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/maniaci-michael-j-m-d/bio-20054934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Maniaci, M.D.</a>, chief clinical officer of Advanced Care at Home at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>While it is not a new concept, home-based care is gaining momentum today because innovative technologies are available to help clinicians provide safe, high-quality, hospital-level treatment for complex and acute cases outside the hospital.</p>



<p>“The secret sauce of Advanced Care at Home is the capability to take care of the sickest patients and provide safety and quality while not replicating the hospital experience,” Dr. Maniaci says. “There is something magical about being at home.”</p>



<p>Under the direction of Mayo Clinic physicians, Advanced Care at Home provides comprehensive services, including infusions, skilled nursing, medications, laboratory and imaging services, behavioral health, and rehabilitation services from a network of paramedics, nurses, and other support team members who ensure that the needs of the patient come first.</p>



<p>Advanced Care at Home also gives clinicians a unique view into patients’ lives, which provides valuable information for their care.</p>



<p>“When <a>you're</a> in their home, they feel much more comfortable. You get to see the dynamic between family members, which is helpful,” says physician assistant Jessica Denton, who was part of David’s care team. “I think you get a more honest patient this way.”</p>



<p>Since its launch in 2021, the program has provided care to over 700 Mayo Clinic patients as part of a strategic relationship with Medically Home, a Boston-based technology company that has helped provide care to more than 26,000 people across the U.S.</p>



<p>As the program’s patient numbers continue to grow, word is getting out — and patients are starting to ask whether healing at home is for them.</p>



<p>“Patients are really excited about it. Especially those that have been in and out of the hospital. Now that we've had the program in place for a few years, patients are asking about it more often. They're aware of the program, and they want to be a part of it. … I think that's a great thing for the patient,” says Dr. Chippi.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>



<p>Positive outcomes such as these point to a bright future for home-based healing.</p>



<p>“Virtual care and hybrid care are a large part of the future of medicine,” says Dr. Maniaci.</p>



<p>David Elder takes a positive view of the future, too. He will officially retire in December, and he and Marcia are currently enjoying spending time with their sixth grandchild, born in September.</p>



<p>His advice for anyone who receives a diagnosis like his?</p>



<p>“I would ask them to think about the life that is still yet to come. There could be years and years of it,” he says. “Do not be so taken by the cancer that it takes the life out of you before it takes the life from you.”</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic doctors are using innovation to improve the lives of people who suffer from congestive heart failure and other chronic heart conditions. The Organ Care System, also known as "heart in a box,” is potentially helping to expand the donor pool, which is crucial, considering that more than 4,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for a new heart. That’s according to the organization <a href="https://donatelife.net/donation/organs/heart-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donate Life America.</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lemond-lisa-m-m-d/bio-20308773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Lisa LeMond</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, explains how the heart perfusion system works.</p>

<p>Every single hour, minute and second counts as the transplant team races against the clock to provide organ recipients with a lifesaving gift.</p>



<p>"In this country, there are not enough hearts to meet the needs of all of the patients who could potentially qualify for a heart transplant," says Dr. LeMond.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Technology is improving methods of preserving and transporting donor hearts</h3>



<p>Innovation is improving transplant surgeries. Typically, donor hearts are retrieved from a person who is declared brain-dead but whose heart is still beating. With the relatively new system, heart in a box, doctors can revive the donated heart by perfusing the organ with warm, oxygenated blood.</p>



<p>"We now have new technology that allows us to place the donor hearts into a special machine which delivers blood and controls the temperature to the heart to allow it to start beating," explains Dr. LeMond.</p>



<p>The perfusion system can preserve the donated heart for up to 12 hours. Before this technology, the donor heart would be on ice in a cooler to preserve it during transport, and doctors only had about four hours to get the heart to the recipient. So far this year (as of Nov. 20), the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center </a>has performed 156 heart transplants across all Mayo Clinic campuses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Heart transplants are performed in patients with:</h3>



<ul>
<li>A weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).</li>



<li>Coronary artery disease.</li>



<li>Heart valve disease.</li>



<li>Congenital heart defect.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Editor's note: The following was written and submitted by David Bradshaw</em></strong>. <strong><em>He shares his journey from COVID, to transplant to gratitude for a second wind, including the part Mayo played in his journey.</em></strong></p>



<p>Imagine sailing through life for 68 years — the picture of good health — without major illness, disease or hospital visits. That was my life ... until <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a> hit me in January 2021. What seemed like a bad case of flu morphed into <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary fibrosis</a> lung disease — a sure death sentence, I thought, within two to four years.</p>



<p>My breathing became increasingly difficult. I required an oxygen tank with any exertion at all, even a short walk to the mailbox. I went from swimming 500 meters three times a week to a couch potato overnight. For months, I desperately hoped my case of COVID-19 might improve.</p>



<p>As I struggled to make sense of this new reality, I met with a local pulmonologist in Sarasota, Florida, who promptly referred me to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida</a>. Within a week, I had hope. Mayo reached out with the news that I might be a candidate for a double-lung transplant. Four weeks later, I drove 220 miles to begin the arduous transplant approval process.</p>



<p>Upon arrival, I marveled at Mayo's ultramodern campus and relaxing interiors. Even more refreshing was the patient-centered culture that pervades the entire Mayo team — from front door valets to the nurses, doctors and surgeons — like a finely tuned engine hitting on all cylinders. I was able to stay at the Gabriel House of Care on campus, featured in the 2020 movie "2 Hearts," which is available to accommodate patients and families before, during and after a transplant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The royal treatment and miracles</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>I spent 14 days in Jacksonville. My schedule was filled with lots of testing to determine if I was healthy enough for a transplant. It may be hard to imagine, but there was little or no waiting time for more than 40 appointments! I felt like I was treated like royalty during this time. As someone who loves music and creating, this model of efficiency later inspired me so much that I ended up writing and recording a song, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbKAkWgs5EE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mayo Royal Treatment<em>.</em></a>"</p>



<p>All of the pre-transplant care at Mayo Clinic was great, especially <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/narula-tathagat-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20305908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. (Tathagat) Narula</a> who convinced me that a transplant was my only viable option. After all the testing at Mayo, I was put on the UNOS list at both Mayo Clinic and Tampa General, due to its closer proximity to Sarasota.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="587" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw2-1024x587.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-377901" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw2-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw2-300x172.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw2-768x440.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw2.jpg 1075w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>On April 12, 2022, I received the OK to be placed on the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lung-transplant/about/pac-20384754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a> list, although I was told it would likely take months, a year or even longer to find my new lungs. Yet, within days, the miracles began.</p>



<p>Miracle 1: Just four days after being put on the transplant list, I received a phone call at 10 p.m. requesting I immediately come to the hospital (Tampa General Hospital) for transplant surgery. A matching set of lungs had been found! The urgency of taking this life-changing step of faith confronted me head-on as I, of course, said, "Yes!"</p>



<p>Miracle 2: After the surgery, my surgeon explained the various difficulties he had encountered. The normal time for this remarkable procedure is six to eight hours, but in my case, it lasted for 18 hours. During the surgery, I had flatlined for almost three minutes! Thankfully, I was resuscitated in time, to my family's relief.</p>



<p>Asked about what I had experienced during those three minutes, I explained that I was aware of a change of consciousness, despite the anesthesia, yet felt no fear. I experienced a unique sense of several things, including love, peace and safety. When my surgeon stopped by the next day, I asked him, "Did I die?" His response was classic, "Not on my watch!" He truly is my hero!</p>

<p>Within days, I began exercising my new heaven-sent lungs. Thanks to the prodding of my tough-loving post-transplant team, I was soon back to eating, drinking normally and up on my feet using a walker. What joy to finally be able to breathe again without supplemental oxygen! I was released from the hospital 18 days later on June 4, 2022.</p>



<p>Ever since, I have followed the doctor's strict orders regarding medications, diet and exercise to ensure that these precious new lungs last as long as possible. I wrote the donor family a thank-you letter expressing my gratefulness. And, of course, being impressed by the selfless gift, I recorded them a song, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y1j9OmfHXo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Can I Say Thanks?</a>"</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thanksgiving every day!</strong></h2>



<p>The road to recovery over the past 18 months has been long but amazing. I don’t know how I can ever express my thanks to everyone who helped me — all the doctors, nurses, technicians, assistants, as well as my family, friends and, most of all, my donor.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw1-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-377899" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/DBradshaw1.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></figure></div>


<p>Today I'm walking 2–4 miles a day, swimming laps again and biking. To celebrate my one-year anniversary, I had a custom T-shirt made as a visible expression of my gratitude.</p>



<p>As a retired writer, I wrote my own autobiography and now feel called to teach a writing class at a local Sarasota college. I also serve as a hospice volunteer and prison minister.</p>



<p>In between all my <em>activities</em>, I love spending time with my family, which includes four daughters, 10 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren — all born in the last year!</p>



<p>Following my transplant, I also began volunteering as a <a href="https://unos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing</a> ambassador to speak about the ever-growing need for new organ donors. Did you know that you can be a living organ donor? Many people do not realize this is an option.</p>



<p>During this season of Thanksgiving, my enthusiasm for life overflows. I am so thankful to Mayo Clinic that I've been given a "second wind!" Because Mayo serves, it leads. Serving is my way of giving thanks.</p>
