<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Don't worry about your hips or knees as you age. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350772?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arthritis</a> in those joints isn't inevitable. Keep doing the activities you enjoy. Those hopeful words come from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sierra-rafael-j-m-d/bio-20054877?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rafael Sierra, M.D.</a>, an orthopedic surgeon at Mayo Clinic specializing in hip and knee reconstruction. Dr. Sierra says there is no need to curtail your activities out of fear that you'll wear out those joints as you age and need joint replacement.</p>



<p>However, certain conditions, such as birth defects and anatomical issues, may predispose a person to have hip or knee problems. Untreated, hip dysplasia and hip impingement are leading causes of hip replacement in people under 50. Having bowlegs, knock knees — or other structural issues­ — can hasten the need for knee replacement.</p>



<p>"But it's not like the rest of us have to be worried and say, 'OK, at age 50, maybe I should have my hips or knees examined by a doctor,'" Dr. Sierra says. "In general, your body — your musculoskeletal system — will let you know when you have issues."</p>



<p>There are no preventive screenings for hips or knees, so pain is a major tip-off that trouble may be brewing. Some people don't even realize they have hip or knee issues until they experience pain doing new activities or movements.</p>



<p>Over the years, innovations in hip and knee implants and surgical techniques have made the operations even more technically precise, Dr. Sierra says. New plastics used in hip and knee replacements are extremely durable.</p>



<p>Changes in anesthesia and pain control techniques have improved the care given to patients before, during and after surgery. More people are having outpatient hip and knee replacement surgery. If you do get a knee or hip replacement, your doctor will likely recommend being conservative with your activities.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Dr. Sierra says avascular necrosis, or the death of bone tissue, remains one of the unsolved issues in hip surgery, with much research still ahead. Also, research continues into abductor tears or tears of the muscles around the hip. Women are especially prone to this condition.</p>

<p>From strikes and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscle-strains/symptoms-causes/syc-20450507?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strains</a> to footwork and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stress-fractures/symptoms-causes/syc-20354057?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fractures</a>, injuries can happen to any young athlete.</p>



<p>Reducing the risk of injury starts with an annual physical to make sure children can participate. When it's time to play, warm up muscles by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/stretching-and-flexibility/hlv-20049447?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stretching</a>, and use protective equipment, when appropriate.</p>



<p>"It's important to try out your equipment before you get into game-time situations to make sure it works properly, so that it's actually protecting you when you're going out there to perform the sport," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>Try to avoid <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/overuse-injury/art-20045875?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overusing</a> certain muscles over others. Repeated motions can happen around <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/growth-plate-fractures/symptoms-causes/syc-20351979?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growth plates</a> and may require young athletes to pause certain activities.</p>



<p>"They need time to rest because they've put too much stress on the area. And without that, they just don't heal," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>If children are injured playing a sport, keep them out of competition until they can be evaluated.</p>



<p>"The worst thing that you can do is get up and try to play through these things and make the injury worse," says Dr. Troyer.</p>

<p>Summer is winding down, and soon kids will be heading onto the field to play their favorite fall sports. But before they can check into the game, they have to head into the doctor's office for sports screenings.</p>



<p>It's generally required that young athletes get a preparticipation exam before participating in organized activities.&nbsp;The exams aren't just a formality. It's to ensure your child's safety and check to see if they are physically able to play.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/anastasi-matthew-b-m-d/bio-20448240">Dr. Matthew Anastasi</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/">sports medicine</a> physician, explains what parents should look for when it comes to sports exams.</p>

<p>"It's very important to identify any potential risk that they may be exposed to before their participation in the respective sport," says Dr. Anastasi.</p>



<p>A typical sports screening includes assessing vision, heart and lungs. Sports medicine specialists also will look at the joints.</p>



<p>"Really focusing on all the joints, ranging from neck, shoulders, elbows, and then moving down to lower extremity hips, knees, ankles," says Dr. Anastasi.</p>



<p>A thorough exam also includes going over medical and family history. This will help identify underlying conditions that might put a child at risk during physical activity.</p>



<p>Dr. Anastasi says sports screenings are not substitutes for health maintenance exams. He also recommends young athletes get a yearly sports physical. </p>



<p>"It's a great opportunity to really identify if something is normal or abnormal, and also to help that athlete succeed at the highest level of his or her ability," says Dr. Anastasi.</p>

<p>There are the obvious physical benefits when kids play sports. It improves cardiovascular health and prevents obesity. But that's not all.</p>



<p>"There can be social benefits where you make friends. You have an opportunity to connect with other people," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/soma-david-b-m-d/bio-20135572?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Dr. David Soma</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric sports medicine specialist.</p>



<p>He says there also are emotional benefits.</p>



<p>"So you learn ... that teamwork piece or that perseverance — learning how to win, learning how to lose."</p>



<p>He says a way to get your kids involved in sports is to start young by just getting them active and outdoors.</p>



<p>"We live in a society where people want to stay inside and stare at screens," says Dr. Soma. "But get outside. Go for a bike ride as a family. Go for a run. Kick the ball around the yard. Just get them moving and seeing what they like to do."</p>



<p>And don't focus on just one individual sport, especially at a younger age.</p>



<p>"There's really good evidence that you should not do that," says Dr. Soma. "It's best to have a kid in the elementary school-aged years really do multiple sports. Expose them to as many different things that they're interested in as possible."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;My 10-year-old daughter was just diagnosed with scoliosis. The curve is 19 degrees, and I have read that it could worsen with time. Will she need to wear a brace? Or is surgery indicated?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;It sounds like your daughter’s case of scoliosis is mild and may not need treatment. But you are correct that scoliosis can progress over time. If it does, your daughter may need to wear a brace to prevent the curve from worsening.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scoliosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350716?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scoliosis</a> is an abnormal sideways curvature of the spine. Most people have a spine that is relatively straight. Generally, a spine with a 10-degree curve or less is considered normal. A curve greater than 10 degrees is defined as scoliosis.</p>



<p>The goal of scoliosis treatment is to keep the curve from getting worse. Treatment options depend in large part on the curve’s severity. Curves between 10 and 25 degrees — where your daughter’s case fits — are in the mild range. The moderate range is between 25 and 50 degrees, and greater than 50 degrees is severe.</p>



<p>Other factors to consider when deciding on scoliosis treatment include a child’s gender — girls have a much higher risk than boys of the curve getting worse, as well as the location and pattern of the spinal curve.</p>



<p>For children who have early detection of scoliosis, treatment with bracing is always the first choice. Typically, braces can be prescribed to treat mild or moderate curves by holding the spine in a corrected position while the spine grows.</p>



<p>A scoliosis brace is made of plastic and contoured to conform to the body. It is a close-fitting brace and goes unnoticed under most clothing, as it fits under the arms and around the rib cage, lower back and hips.</p>



<p>Braces work by pushing on the muscles and bones attached to the spine. This holds the spine in place, preventing it from curving more and typically straightening the alignment of a curved spine.&nbsp; Physical therapy can help with pain control and improved posture.</p>



<p>Because a brace’s effectiveness increases with the number of hours it is worn, most children wear their braces day and night. But one caveat about braces: they only work to treat scoliosis in children who are still growing. For most kids, brace treatment typically is no longer an option after age 16. But once a child stops growing, it also is unlikely that a spinal curve will progress any further.</p>



<p>There are now several motion-sparing surgical treatment options for patients with moderate to severe scoliosis to help preserve spinal flexibility and growth. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vertebral body tethering.</strong><br>The spine is accessed through small incisions in the side, and a special camera is used during surgery. Metal screws are placed in the vertebrae where the spine is curved, and a plastic cord connects these screws. The cord is tensioned to shorten the long side of the scoliosis curve, acting as an internal brace. As children continue to grow, the curve may correct over time. The cord is flexible so the spine still can move, and the spine can continue to grow.&nbsp; Patients can return to all sports in six weeks.</li>



<li><strong>Posterior dynamic distraction.</strong><br>An incision is made over the back. Three screws are placed and connected with a single rod with two ball-bearing joints to allow motion and growth.</li>
</ul>



<p>Severe scoliosis almost always can benefit from surgical treatment. The most common type of scoliosis surgery is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/spinal-fusion/about/pac-20384523?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spinal fusion</a>, which involves connecting two or more of the bones in the spine together so they can’t move independently. After fusion, the spine no longer grows over the area where the spine is fused, and the spine does not move over the fused area. In most cases, the unfused spine area can compensate, and children can perform most daily activities and return to most sports in three to six months.</p>



<p>Talk to your daughter’s healthcare team about her diagnosis and the risk of the spinal curve worsening. Many children with mild curves, such as your daughter, do not need a brace or surgery. Instead, focus on correct posture and regular follow-up appointments with her healthcare professional about every six months to check for any evidence that the curve may be worsening.</p>



<p>If, at some point, her curve grows and crosses the line from mild to moderate severity at about 25 degrees, then treatment, such as a brace, may be necessary. It may be worthwhile to consult with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/orthopedic-surgery/home/orc-20126749?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pediatric orthopedic surgeon</a> to understand what may be necessary in the future.</p>



<p>Also, talk to your daughter about how she’s feeling. Coping with scoliosis can be difficult for pre-teens and teens. Support and encouragement from family and friends can help. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/larson-a-noelle-m-d/bio-20055469?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Dr. A.

<p>Jennifer Budd's biggest accomplishment is also her biggest heartbreak.</p>



<p>Jen, an MRI scanning technician at Mayo Clinic in Florida, started running in 2009 to get into shape and to reduce stress.</p>



<p>Soon, running progressed into a passion, not just for her but also for her family. By 2013, she had completed eight half-marathons. But she'd also had two knee surgeries — an ACL surgery and a meniscus repair.</p>



<p>The surgeries didn't slow her down — at least not initially. She actually was thinking bigger. &nbsp;</p>



<p>She had watched her husband complete a marathon and wanted to try it herself. In 2014, she accomplished that goal.</p>



<p>"There is something cathartic about running. The simplicity helps to clear my mind," Jen says. "I also like the commitment it takes to run a marathon — following the training schedule, putting in the time, and then meeting up with thousands of other runners and crossing the finish line together."</p>



<p>Eventually, knee pain caught up to her, however, and she couldn't continue running.</p>



<p>"My knee pain steadily increased until 2020, when I had to wave the white flag," Jen says. "My activity level was greatly reduced due to the pain in my knee, and I knew it was time."</p>



<p>That's when she met with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ortiguera-cedric-j-m-d/bio-20053864?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cedric Ortiguera, M.D</a>., an orthopedic surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reclaiming her passion for running</h3>



<p>Jen was no stranger to Mayo Clinic. She calls herself fully "Mayo-nized." She was born at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and next year will celebrate 25 years of working at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>During Jen's appointment, Dr. Ortiguera recommended that she undergo surgery to replace her patella-femoral joint, also known as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/knee-replacement/doctors-departments/pdc-20385277?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partial knee replacement</a>.</p>



<p>Jen agreed to the surgery after talking through her goals.</p>



<p>"Dr. Ortiguera is amazing. He is incredibly kind and patient. He listened to me and knew what I wanted to achieve after surgery," Jen says. "I knew that without the surgery, I would have never been able to continue being active, and my quality of life would not have been the same."</p>



<p>&nbsp;There was work to do after the surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"The recovery process was humbling," Jen recalls.</p>



<p>She treated recovery like a full-time job and began physical therapy right away.</p>



<p>"I got to know my physical therapy team well. They were so knowledgeable and gave me the right tools to help me regain muscle strength," Jen says. "It was fun celebrating milestones with them —– making a complete revolution on the bike, walking up stairs, bending my knee past 90 degrees."</p>



<p>Her commitment to physical therapy paid off when Dr. Ortiguera gave her the green light to start running again. She laced up her shoes and started training for her first post-surgery race — the New York City Marathon.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Not slowing down</h3>



<p>About a year later, Jen returned to see Dr. Ortiguera for a follow-up appointment.</p>



<p>"My favorite moment was when he asked what activities I had been doing," she says. "I told him I had been using my Peloton bike, doing strength training, and I ran the New York City Marathon.</p>



<p>"He was genuinely happy for me," Jen says. "I felt like I had crossed the finish line again."</p>



<p>Since that visit, Jen has completed three more marathons, and she doesn't plan to slow down anytime soon.</p>



<p>"My goal is to run the six major world marathons — New York City, Berlin, London, Chicago, Tokyo and Boston," she says.</p>



<p>With New York City, London and Berlin crossed off her list, that leaves only three.</p>



<p>"I am running the Chicago Marathon in October and have already applied to run the Tokyo Marathon. I am still chasing the Boston Marathon qualifying time," Jen says. "Running with my husband and sons has been such an amazing experience. I have never crossed a finish line without crying tears of pride."</p>



<p>And she says she can't thank Mayo Clinic and Dr. Ortiguera enough for fixing her up and getting her back on track to pursue her passion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;My grandmother lives with me, and she is always nagging me to "stand up straight" and "put your shoulders back." She says good posture will keep me healthy as I age. But I'm only 17. Does it really matter if I'm slouching a bit?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Though it may seem annoying, your grandmother is correct in that good posture supports good health. And starting good habits now, though it requires conscious effort, can help you throughout your life.</p>



<p>Proper body alignment can help prevent excess strain on your joints, muscles and spine <em>—</em> alleviating pain and reducing the likelihood of injury. As a bonus, correct posture can boost your productivity and mood, as well as help you use your muscles more efficiently. And starting good habits now can last a lifetime when they are needed most.</p>



<p>You may wonder what does proper posture look like? Use the "wall test" to find out:</p>



<ul>
<li>Stand so that the back of your head, your shoulder blades and your buttocks touch the wall, and your heels are 2 to 4 inches from the wall.</li>



<li>Put a flat hand behind the small of your back. You should be able to just barely slide your hand between your lower back and the wall for a correct lower back curve.</li>



<li>If there's too much space behind your lower back, draw your belly button toward your spine. This flattens the curve in your back and gently brings your lower back closer to the wall.</li>



<li>If there's too little space behind your lower back, arch your back just enough so that your hand can slide behind you.</li>



<li>Walk away from the wall while holding a proper posture. Then return to the wall to check whether you kept a correct posture.</li>
</ul>



<p>Unfortunately, ideal posture often is the exception rather than the rule. Poor posture can affect you from head to toe, contributing to several problems no matter your age.</p>



<p>These are among the most common problems resulting from poor posture:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Headache.</strong><br>Poor posture can strain the muscles at the back of your head, neck, upper back and jaw. This can put pressure on nearby nerves and trigger what are known as tension-type or muscle-spasm headaches.</li>



<li><strong>Back and neck pain.</strong><br>Pain and tightness or stiffness in the back and neck can be due to injury and other conditions, such as arthritis, herniated disks and osteoporosis, but poor posture is a common contributor. Though rarely life-threatening, back and neck pain can be chronic and reduce your quality of life.</li>



<li><strong>Knee, hip and foot pain.</strong><br>Muscle weakness; tightness or imbalances; lack of flexibility; and poor alignment of your hips, knees and feet may prevent your kneecap, or patella, from sliding smoothly over your femur. The ensuing friction can cause irritation and pain in the front of the knee, a condition known as patellofemoral pain. Poor foot and ankle alignment also can contribute to plantar fasciitis, a condition in which the thick band of tissue connecting your heel to the ball of your foot becomes inflamed and causes heel pain.</li>



<li><strong>Shoulder pain and impingement.</strong><br>Your rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that connect your upper arm to your shoulder. Muscle tightness, weakness or imbalances associated with poor posture can cause the tendons in your rotator cuff to become irritated and cause pain and weakness. A forward, hunched posture also can cause these tendons to become pinched, or impinged. Eventually, this can lead to a tear in the rotator cuff tissue, a more serious injury that can cause significant pain and weakness, and limit your ability to carry out daily activities.</li>



<li><strong>Jaw pain.</strong><br>A forward head posture may strain the muscles under your chin and cause your temporomandibular, or TMJ, joint to become overworked. This may result in pain, fatigue and popping in your jaw, as well as difficulty opening your mouth, headaches and neck pain.</li>



<li><strong>Fatigue and breathing problems.</strong><br>Poor postural habits may restrict your rib cage and compress your diaphragm. This can reduce lung capacity, leading to shallow or labored breathing, fatigue and lack of energy, which can affect your overall productivity.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Tips to improve your posture</strong></h2>



<p>Here are three ways to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/multimedia/back-pain/sls-20076817?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve your posture</a> while standing, sitting and lying in bed:</p>



<ol type="1">
<li>While walking, stand tall. Inhale, roll your shoulders up and back, then exhale and roll your shoulders down, as if you are gently tucking your shoulder blades into your back pockets.</li>



<li>Try seated pelvic tilts. Sit on the edge of a chair, place your hands on your thighs and rest your feet on the floor. Inhale and rock your pelvis and ribs forward while you open your chest and look upward. Exhale, rock your pelvis and spine back and look down toward the floor.</li>



<li>Do a wake-up or bedtime bridge pose. Lie on your back in bed with your knees bent and your feet resting on the mattress. Inhale, then slowly exhale and curl your tailbone to lift your buttocks and spine, one vertebra at a time, until your shoulder blades bear your weight. Pause and inhale, then slowly exhale as you roll your spine back down.</li>
</ol>



<p>Improving your posture can help prevent or reverse many conditions. You'll be amazed to see how your quality of life can improve <em>—</em> simply by standing a little taller. <em><em>—</em> </em><strong><em>Compiled by </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-this-site/welcome?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Mayo Clinic staff</em></strong></a></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I'm a homebuilder and have begun experiencing numbness and tingling in my hands. Sometimes I drop things because I can't get a good grip. A friend suggested I might have carpal tunnel syndrome. But doesn't that mostly affect people who use computers all day? Can you explain more about the condition?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Working with your hands day after day can take a toll on them, causing pain, numbness and weakness. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one condition that can affect many types of occupations, including farmers, truck drivers, factory and construction workers, and others.</p>



<p>Carpal tunnel is a condition caused by compression of the median nerve located in the wrist. This nerve provides feeling to the thumb and the index, middle and part of the ring fingers, and also sends signals to the muscles around the base of the thumb.</p>



<p>Some causes of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355608?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carpal tunnel syndrome</a> include medical conditions such as arthritis, gout, diabetes, amyloidosis, infections, masses and severe wrist injuries. Other causes are environmental or workplace conditions that involve forceful and repetitive gripping, and using heavy machinery and vibrating manual tools.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355603?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms of carpal tunnel</a> syndrome include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Numbness and tingling in the fingers</li>



<li>Swelling and discomfort of the hands and fingers</li>



<li>Weakness, especially when pinching and gripping</li>



<li>Dropping things</li>



<li>Waking up at night to shake out the hands</li>



<li>Numbness of the fingers first thing in the morning</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome</strong></h2>



<p>To determine if you have carpal tunnel syndrome, an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/orthopedic-surgery/home/orc-20126749?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">orthopedic specialist</a> will discuss the history of your symptoms and perform a physical examination of your hands and wrists.</p>



<p>Other tests may be performed or requested, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Two-point discrimination test on your fingertips to identify which fingers have decreased sensation</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Tinel's test, which is conducted by tapping the nerve in the carpal tunnel at the wrist to see if it causes tingling in your fingers</li>



<li>Durkan's test, which involves pressing a thumb over the nerve in the carpal tunnel at the wrist to see if the numbness or tingling gets worse</li>



<li>X-rays of your affected hand</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treating the condition</strong></h2>



<p>Treatment strategies are divided into nonsurgical and surgical measures.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/multimedia/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-treatments/vid-20084643?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nonsurgical treatments</a> include wearing a wrist brace during the night and undergoing cortisone injections.</p>



<p>Surgical intervention for carpal tunnel syndrome is a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/multimedia/carpal-tunnel-release/img-20008129?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carpal tunnel release</a>. The roof of the carpal tunnel is divided, which relieves pressure on the median nerve. Surgery may be open or endoscopic.</p>



<p>Both open and endoscopic surgery are outpatient procedures. Endoscopic surgery is minimally invasive. It's performed in an operating room with or without light sedation. After medication is injected to numb the palm and wrist, a small incision is made near the wrist. A tiny camera is inserted through the incision into the carpal tunnel. The surgeon inspects the tunnel and then uses a blade attached to the camera to cut the transverse carpal ligament <em>—</em> the roof of the tunnel <em>—</em> to relieve nerve compression.</p>



<p>For the best results after surgery, be sure to consult an orthopedic hand surgeon while numbness and tingling are still intermittent rather than constant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Preventing carpal tunnel syndrome</strong></h2>



<p>There are no proven strategies to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, but you can minimize stress on the hands and wrists by:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Reducing your force and relaxing your grip.</strong><br>If your work involves a cash register or keyboard, for instance, hit the keys softly.</li>



<li><strong>Taking short, frequent breaks.</strong><br>Gently stretch and bend hands and wrists periodically. Alternate tasks when possible. This is especially important if you use equipment that vibrates or requires you to exert a great amount of force. Even a few minutes each hour can make a difference.</li>



<li><strong>Watching your form.</strong><br>Avoid bending your wrist all the way up or down. A relaxed middle position is best.</li>



<li><strong>Improving your posture.</strong><br>Incorrect posture rolls shoulders forward, shortening the neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in the neck. This can affect the wrists, fingers and hands, and can cause neck pain.</li>



<li><strong>Keeping your hands warm.</strong><br>You're more likely to develop hand pain and stiffness if you work in a cold environment. If you can't control the temperature at work, put on fingerless gloves that keep the hands and wrists warm.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you're experiencing symptoms, consult with an orthopedic specialist to determine the best treatment to keep you on the job or get you back to work. <a><em><em>—</em></em></a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/kristin-karim-md?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Dr. Kristin Karim</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/albert-lea?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Albert Lea</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/austin?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Austin</strong></em></a><strong><em>, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I am trying to get into shape for summer, and one area that has always been challenging has been my upper arms. Recently, though, I began a workout routine, but a friend warned me about the risk of injuries. Do you have any advice to avoid problems?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Having well-defined, muscular upper arms often is the goal of anyone seeking a fit and toned appearance. But there's more to these hardworking muscles than good looks.</p>



<p>The primary arm muscles include the biceps, the muscle in front of your arm, and the triceps, the one at the back. They do the heavy lifting when flexing or extending your arm and making twisting motions.</p>



<p>Despite their strength, these muscles can be damaged through overuse or forceful injury, such as lifting a heavy object from a truck bed or incorrectly using weights at the gym. Overuse can irritate the tendons, which connect muscles to bones, causing pain and inflammation. A forceful injury can tear or rupture the <a href="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/condition/biceps-triceps-tendon-injuries/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bicep or tricep tendons</a>.</p>



<p>Injuries to the upper arm muscles and tendons are most common in men 30-50, but women also may experience them.</p>



<p>While bruising and swelling are obvious signs of an injury, many people may simply experience severe <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/arm-pain/basics/causes/sym-20050870?p=1?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arm pain</a> as well as shoulder and arm weakness. Depending upon the situation, there also may be a bulge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Tendon ruptures are most common</strong></h2>



<p>Among the most common injuries is a tendon rupture. If you have a ruptured tendon, you likely may feel a tearing sensation and actually hear a pop. This typically occurs around the elbow but sometimes at the shoulder. The muscle tends to ball up, forming a "Popeye" bulge that doesn't improve. It usually is accompanied by swelling, bruising, cramping and extreme pain, as well as loss of function.</p>



<p>The sooner a rupture is treated, the better the recovery, since scar tissue can form and the arm muscles can begin to weaken or atrophy. Consult with an orthopedic surgeon to learn about both nonsurgical and surgical options.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treating upper arm injuries</strong></h2>



<p>Some patients choose to forego surgery. However, pain, arm function and appearance won't improve over time.</p>



<p>If a tendon ruptures, the first line of treatment is to reattach it to the bone using sutures and anchors. This surgery is typically an outpatient procedure, with patients going home the same day.</p>



<p>Recovery may take three months or more. After surgery, the arm is immobilized by a splint with a 90-degree bend at the elbow and a sling for several weeks, giving the repair time to heal.</p>



<p>Passive therapy, where someone moves your arm for you, is designed to help you regain range of motion and prevent the elbow from stiffening. You may want to continue using the sling for protection and comfort.</p>



<p>At four to five weeks after surgery, active motion helps you regain strength. At that point, you'll be able to do light activities, such as getting dressed, personal care and working at a computer. By three months, you'll be gradually rebuilding strength through increased activity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Preventing injury</strong></h2>



<p>To prevent injury to your upper arm muscles and tendons, maintain overall strength, avoid overloading your arm muscles and be sure you're using proper technique when working with weights at home or the gym. If you are not sure what proper technique means, consider reaching out to a sports medicine specialist or a physical medicine expert.</p>



<p>If you are concerned about an injury, don’t delay in seeking out care. It's important to speak to a medical professional as soon as you have concerns so that your healing and recovery can begin. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/doug-bartels-md?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Dr. Douglas Bartels</strong></em></a><strong><em>, Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Eau Claire, Wisconsin</em></strong></a></p>
