<p>Many people promise to exercise more in the new year, but jump-starting your workout routine can be challenging if you've been sitting on the couch for a while. It can seem like a daunting task.</p>

<p>Starting a workout program or being physically active takes motivation and commitment. The key is to start slowly and do something you take pleasure in.</p>



<p>"If you hate swimming, don't try to start to become a swimmer. But (if) you enjoy dancing or other activities (such as) gardening, those are forms of activity that once you engage in, you increase your consistency and compliance that will have the most health benefits," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>

<p>Being active can build muscle strength and improve cognitive and cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>"Three percent or 30 minutes a day of our waking hours, if we commit that to physical activity, will have huge benefits," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>And for those young at heart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.</p>



<p>"As we get older, dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips to get started and stick with a workout plan:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Research workout routines.</li>



<li>Schedule your workouts.</li>



<li>Find an exercise buddy.</li>



<li>Be consistent.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's officially 2024. A new year offers new beginnings and an opportunity to reset your eating habits after the holidays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is your refrigerator holding onto holiday leftovers? It's OK to let them go.</p>



<p>"What we want to do is, if we have any remaining food items or beverages that lingered after the holidays, we want to get rid of them," she says.</p>

<p>Either throw leftovers away or slowly eat them in smaller <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1">por</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tions</a>.</p>



<p>"We also want to slowly regress back to our old habits. Start introducing vegetables and fruits with most meals," says Delgado.</p>



<p>And pay attention to your food portion sizes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We don't necessarily have to go on a diet. We don't necessarily have to eliminate all of our foods. We just want to look at the portion sizes and the frequency that we have these foods," she says.</p>



<p>Opt for lean protein, whole grains and fresh produce in your diet, still allowing for an occasional treat.</p>



<p>"With nutrition, there is no all or nothing. We can still enjoy those nice treats, those good desserts, those savory beverages. It's all in how much and how often we are having them," says Delgado.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reset your eating habits with portion control</h3>



<p>Simplify your portion control by dividing your plate into three sections. This can assist you in making healthier food choices and managing your portions more effectively.</p>



<ul>
<li>One-half: fruit and nonstarchy vegetables</li>



<li>One-quarter: whole grains</li>



<li>One-quarter: protein-rich foods, such as legumes, fish or lean meats</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether it's the annual <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/in-depth/flu-shots/art-20048000?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flu shot</a>, latest <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/questions-answered-about-the-covid-19-bivalent-booster-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 booster</a>, or milestone shots that cover pneumonia, shingles or tetanus, staying up to date on immunizations is just one way to protect your health.</p>



<p>"It's worthwhile having that conversation with your primary care team because we might change depending on conditions that you have and potentially even the age at which you would receive that vaccine," says Dr. Presutti.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adult vaccinations to update</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pneumonia</a> can be life-threatening when fluid fills the lungs' air sacs. In general, a vaccination is recommended for all adults 65 and older.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shingles/symptoms-causes/syc-20353054?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shingles</a>, a reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox, can cause a painful, blistering rash. Vaccination is recommended in adults over 50.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetanus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351625?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tetanus</a> is caused by a bacterial infection, often from a cut or wound. The Tdap vaccine is recommended every 10 years and also protects against diphtheria and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/whooping-cough-pertussis-is-a-highly-contagious-respiratory-tract-infection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pertussis</a> – the latter known as whooping cough.</p>



<p>"If you're a new parent or a new grandparent, then you should be getting the pertussis update vaccine to decrease the risk of you actually communicating, or giving, pertussis to the newborn baby," says Dr. Presutti.</p>

Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/12/MCM-Be-realistic-with-your-New-Years-resolution.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Most people have done it at least once. They make a New Year's resolution to get in better shape, but give up after a few days or weeks.</p>



<p>Johnson says there are a few things you can do to increase your odds of making good on that resolution.</p>



<p>"Making sure that you start with a really realistic goal," Johnson says, is the first step, "then really thinking about what do you enjoy."</p>



<p>Johnson says one of the first hurdles that trips a lot of people up is forcing themselves to do exercises they hate.</p>



<p>"[Start] looking at some new goals that you can be excited about," she says. "Exercise should not be drudgery. Exercise should be fun."</p>



<p>Johnson says it's also important to be realistic about your time commitment.</p>



<p>"Maybe you only have 20, 30 minutes three days a week," she says. "Start from a place where we can build success. You can always add more."</p>



<p>But above all else, she says, be honest with yourself about what you can stick to. If it's not a feasible goal, your chances of achieving it drop drastically.</p>



<p>"So having realistic, healthy expectations can be a really good way to move forward in a very successful physical activity plan."</p>

<p>During the holiday season, it may seem like opportunities to celebrate are everywhere, and alcohol is often part of the festivities. When it comes to alcohol, though, the key is moderation. Besides the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/alcohol/art-20044551?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-term risks of alcohol use</a>, an immediate consequence is often a hangover.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>What is a hangover?</strong></p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hangovers/symptoms-causes/syc-20373012?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hangover</a>&nbsp;is a group of unpleasant signs and symptoms that can develop after drinking too much alcohol. Generally, the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to have a hangover the next day. But no magic formula can tell you how much you can drink and still avoid a hangover.</p>



<p>Hangover signs and symptoms typically begin when your blood alcohol content drops significantly and is at or near zero. They're usually in full effect the morning after a night of heavy drinking and can include fatigue, excessive thirst, dry mouth, headache and nausea.</p>



<p>However unpleasant, most hangovers go away on their own. In the meantime, you can ease the discomfort by taking these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hangovers/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373015?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">measures</a>.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>When is a hangover an emergency?</strong></p>



<p>Severe signs and symptoms that accompany heavy drinking may indicate alcohol poisoning, which is a life-threatening emergency.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms that may indicate alcohol poisoning include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Confusion</li>



<li>Vomiting</li>



<li>Seizures</li>



<li>Slow breathing (less than eight breaths per minute)</li>



<li>Irregular breathing (a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths)</li>



<li>Blue-tinged or pale skin</li>



<li>Low body temperature</li>



<li>Difficulty remaining conscious</li>



<li>Passing out and can't be awakened</li>
</ul>



<p>If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning — even if you don't see the classic signs and symptoms — call 911 or your local emergency number.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Are you concerned about your alcohol use?</strong></p>

This disorder also involves having to drink more to get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking called alcoholism.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369250?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment</a>&nbsp;for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. The goal of treatment is to stop alcohol use to improve quality of life.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I worry about my neighbors this time of year who live alone. Are there health risks to loneliness? What can be done to help?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Up to 40% of older adults feel lonely. Loneliness can occur in all age groups, but people over the age of 60 have been shown to have higher incidences of both loneliness and social isolation. Loneliness is a feeling, while social isolation is something that can be measured. For example, how often do you talk to someone? How often do you leave the house? Do you attend religious services or other community events? Some people can be surrounded by a crowd but still feel lonely because they're not experiencing good connections. Social isolation measures how often you interact with other people and genuinely connect.</p>



<p>Health risks associated with loneliness can include depression, anxiety, increased risks of suicide, premature death, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dementia</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strokes</a>, heart attacks and other chronic health risks. The health risks of a lack of social connection can be just as high as the health risks of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>, smoking, physical inactivity or excessive alcohol consumption. If we pay attention to those other areas of our health, we should pay attention to social connectedness. High blood pressure, stroke and heart attack risk increase as we age. If you combine that risk with someone who is also lonely, that can increase the health risk.  </p>



<p>If someone falls who is socially isolated, the risk of complications from a potential hip fracture increases because no one may be checking in on them. If patients are admitted to the hospital for a heart attack and score high on loneliness, they are more likely to get readmitted to the hospital. If you need a colonoscopy but don't have someone to drive you, you might not get your needed procedure done. Health systems recognize these healthcare impacts and now routinely ask patients about their social connections. The U.K. and Japanese governments have recognized the public health impacts and have established ministerial leads addressing loneliness, including a "Campaign to End Loneliness" in the U.K.</p>



<p>There are many things that you can do to address loneliness and social isolation. One of the best is addressing sensory deprivation, specifically hearing and vision. When someone has hearing loss, it becomes challenging (even with hearing aids) to go to a party or a crowded restaurant. The person withdraws because they can't understand what's happening around them. Things that can help this are getting your hearing checked, ensuring you have a suitable hearing aid and learning how to use it properly. These little "computers for your ears" can make interacting with people in a social setting easier.</p>



<p>Taking the first steps may be intimidating, but someone else's assistance could help get you there. Social workers can be a great resource for connecting people to social resources. People may find support from a faith community or hobby groups. You find like-minded people when you do things you are passionate about or interested in. Many people benefit from intergenerational activities such as volunteering in schools and reading to children at the library. Social media and online resources can be another way to discover these opportunities.</p>



<p>While social media is a tool that can be used to connect to people of similar interests, there is still a need for direct human interaction. Physical touch, such as a handshake or a hug, is vital from infancy onward. The holidays can be an intensified time for people to be aware of their loneliness. Maybe you saw someone throwing a holiday party, but you were home alone. Loneliness may spike during the holidays because of what is seen in the media, through our own expectations or loss of family connection.</p>



<p>When we feel lonely, we may feel like people should come to us and fill our cups, but sometimes it's up to us to put ourselves out there. Even if you take a moment to make a small interaction at the grocery store, it may make your world seem a little less lonely. If we can start giving some energy to the universe, the universe will give it back to us and help us all feel more connected to each other. <em>— <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shah-amit-a-m-d/bio-20113894?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Amit Shah</a></strong></em><strong><em>, Geriatrician, Internist, Palliative Care Specialist, Mayo Clinic in Arizona</em></strong></p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. – The holidays have come and gone once again, and many of us are starting to think about just how much we indulged this season.</p>



<p>"When it came to eating, how did this past holiday season treat you? Which healthy habits did you maintain and which ones did you neglect?" asks <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/-/media/shared-files/images/medical-professionals/full/mankato/lisa-hardesty-phdlp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Hardesty,</a> Ph.D., a clinical health psychologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato</a>. "It is easy to feel like a failure in relationship to maintaining our healthy focus, but consistency and allowing yourself grace are important concepts to remember over the holiday time."</p>



<p>Shame, guilt and disappointment are several feelings that can lead people to kick-start strict diets beginning Jan. 1. But drastic overnight changes to habits are rarely sustainable. That's why Hardesty recommends mindful eating throughout the year.</p>



<p>"With so much of our family and social time structured around food and the act of eating during the holidays, it's no wonder that we feel like we need a reset to our eating habits this time of year when the celebrations are over," says Hardesty. "But there are healthier, more sustainable ways to approach eating habits."</p>



<p>Here are Hardesty's recommendations to lessen your responsiveness to food triggers.</p>



<p><strong>Identify your "why."</strong> Adopting a healthy eating mindset starts with identifying the reasons you want to eat healthier. What compelling reasons come up when you consider this question?</p>



<p><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> Having a plan is one of the most important things you can do. Anticipate when you may have more difficulty making healthy choices and create a solid plan for those times.</p>



<p><strong>Slow down.</strong> Instead of moving from dish to dish, first survey the options in front of you and decide which ones you want and how much you want before adding food to your plate. Then, when you sit down to eat, savor your food and focus mindfully to help you make better choices compared to eating without conscious thought.</p>



<p><strong>Allow for indulgences.</strong> It's also important to allow yourself a few unhealthy food options but decide when and where you will make those choices. When you eat those lower quality foods, be aware of your negative emotions and don’t allow shame to perpetuate overindulgences.</p>



<p><strong>Additional techniques to help modify your eating behavior include:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Bringing fruit and vegetables to holiday gatherings to create more options for yourself and others.</li>



<li>Eating a light snack before attending holiday events to lessen the likelihood of overeating.</li>



<li>Measuring and portioning your food over the holidays.</li>



<li>Increasing your level of activity and exercise.</li>



<li>Committing to making changes with someone close to you.</li>



<li>Banking your calories if you know you'll attend an event with more food options available.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Don't despair if you temporarily lose control of your food choices," says Hardesty. "Remember, consistency is key – not perfection."</p>

<p>Hormone changes are a natural part of aging, but the experience is different for men and women. Unlike the more dramatic plunge that occurs in women during menopause, sex hormone changes in men occur gradually. This is sometimes called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/mens-health/in-depth/male-menopause/art-20048056?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">male menopause</a>.</p>



<p>For women, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a> marks the end of their menstrual cycles, whether by naturally declining reproductive hormones, surgical removal of the ovaries, changes caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or a conditional called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-ovarian-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20354683?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary ovarian insufficiency</a>. Ovulation ends and hormone production plummets during a relatively short period of time.</p>



<p>In men, production of testosterone and other hormones declines over a period of many years and the consequences aren't necessarily clear. This gradual decline of testosterone levels is called late-onset hypogonadism or age-related low testosterone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Recognizing low testosterone levels</strong></h2>



<p>A man's testosterone levels decline on average about 1% a year after 40. But most older men still have testosterone levels within the normal range, with only an estimated 10% to 25% having levels considered to be low.</p>



<p>Low testosterone levels in older men often goes unnoticed. Testosterone levels can be checked by a blood test, but tests aren't done routinely. And many men who have low testosterone levels experience no symptoms. In addition, the signs and symptoms associated with low testosterone aren't specific to low testosterone. They also can be caused by a person's age, medication use, or other conditions, such as having a body mass index of 30 or higher.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms suggestive of low testosterone include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced sexual desire and activity.</li>



<li>Decreased spontaneous erections or erectile dysfunction.</li>



<li>Breast discomfort or swelling.</li>



<li>Infertility.</li>



<li>Height loss, low trauma fracture or low bone mineral density.</li>



<li>Hot flushes or sweats.</li>
</ul>



<p>Other possible symptoms include decreased energy, motivation and confidence; depressed mood; and poor concentration. It's also possible to experience increased sleepiness; sleep disturbances; mild, unexplained anemia; reduced muscle bulk and strength; and increased body fat.</p>



<p>Experts recommend only testing older men for low testosterone if they have signs or symptoms. If an initial test shows low testosterone, the test should be repeated to confirm the results. If low testosterone is confirmed, further testing of the pituitary gland is recommended to determine the cause and rule out other hormone deficiencies. The pituitary gland is a kidney-bean-sized gland situated at the base of your brain. It is part of your body's endocrine system, which consists of all the glands that produce and regulate hormones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Recommendations on <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/sexual-health/in-depth/testosterone-therapy/art-20045728?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testosterone therapy</a> for men with age-related low testosterone vary. In 2020, the American College of Physicians recommended that healthcare professionals consider starting testosterone treatment in men with sexual dysfunction who want to improve their sexual function, after explaining the risks and benefits. In 2018, the Endocrine Society recommended testosterone therapy for men with age-related low testosterone who have signs and symptoms associated with low testosterone.</p>



<p>Some experts also recommend offering testosterone treatment to men with age-related low testosterone without the presence of signs or symptoms.</p>



<p>If you choose to start testosterone therapy, your healthcare professional will explain the different ways testosterone can be administered, target levels and follow-up testing.</p>



<p>For some men, testosterone therapy relieves bothersome signs and symptoms of testosterone deficiency. For others, the benefits aren't clear, and there are possible risks.</p>



<p>Though further research is needed, testosterone therapy might stimulate growth of metastatic prostate and breast cancer. Testosterone therapy also may increase the risk of heart attack and stroke and contribute to the formation of blood clots in the veins.</p>



<p>Your healthcare team likely will recommend against starting testosterone therapy if your fertility is important in the near future or if you have conditions such as breast or prostate cancer, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, uncontrolled heart failure, or thrombophilia, or if you've recently had a heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>If you think you might have low testosterone, talk to your healthcare team about your signs and symptoms, testing, and possible treatment options. They can help you weigh the pros and cons of treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (:56) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Script-MCM-Salmonella.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Salmonella is a bacterial infection that affects the intestinal tract.</p>



<p>"Salmonella is contracted through poorly cooked foods — such as meat, poultry, eggs, milk — poor water conditions or poor sanitation," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>The infection also can be spread through human and animal feces.</p>



<p>"Salmonella may cause an intestinal infection, such as having diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, and, in some cases, fever," he says.</p>



<p>The good news is that, generally, cases will resolve on their own within a few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"In some cases, with severe illness, where it's unrelenting beyond a few days, seeking prompt medical attention is very important," says Dr. Bracamonte.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how can you protect yourself?</p>



<p>Be careful when preparing food, especially raw meat and poultry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevent cross-contamination of foods, and most importantly, wash your hands.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Causes of salmonella infection</h3>



<p>People can become ill from infection from a variety of sources. Commonly infected foods include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Raw meat, poultry and seafood</strong><br>Feces may get onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process. Seafood may be contaminated if harvested from contaminated water.</li>



<li><strong>Raw eggs</strong><br>While an egg's shell may seem to be a perfect barrier to contamination, some infected chickens produce eggs that contain salmonella before the shell is even formed. Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.</li>



<li><strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong><br>Some fresh produce, particularly imported varieties, may be hydrated in the field or washed during processing with water contaminated with salmonella. Contamination also can occur in the kitchen when juices from raw meat and poultry come into contact with uncooked foods, such as salads.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some pet foods, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/kiambu-11-23/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dry dog food</a>, may be contaminated with salmonella and can infect animals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Bracamonte says salmonella also is harbored in some animals,&nbsp;such as reptileacs and birds. So if you have those pets, it's important that you wash your hands appropriately after handling them.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve heard "a calorie is a calorie" when it comes to weight loss, but can that really be true? With the number of diets out there (keto, intermittent fasting, Mediterranean), I'm completely overwhelmed with what I'm meant to be doing.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Yes and no. (Isn't that always the answer to nutrition inquiries?) While a calorie <em>may</em> be a calorie when it comes to the mathematical equation of weight loss, there's more to it. Calories are a unit of energy. The total calories a food or beverage provides depend on the number of grams of carbohydrates, protein, fat and/or alcohol contained. The number of calories, though, does not predict how we'll feel afterward.</p>



<p>For example, a 200-calorie snack of an apple with peanut butter is going to help you feel fuller and more satisfied than a 200-calorie snack of chips. The difference is in not only the food composition but food volume as well. The apple and peanut butter snack will provide fiber, fat, water and some protein. The majority of these attributes are lacking when it comes to the chips.</p>



<p>Think volume too — the apple snack will stretch the stomach more due to its larger size, sending that fullness signal to the brain. The 200 calories worth of chips also are going to be digested and leave the stomach faster than the apple because there's not much breakdown that needs to happen.</p>



<p>We also can't talk about this topic without referencing health outcomes. It is well known that the composition of one's diet, or dietary pattern, is significant. A plant-based diet containing whole grains, fruits, vegetables, unsaturated fats and lean proteins provides the body with balanced nutrition that can decrease the risk of chronic conditions.</p>



<p>There are multiple ways to do this healthfully. Diet styles such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mediterranean</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">DASH</a> and the <a href="https://diet.mayoclinic.org/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Diet</a> are examples of eating patterns that focus on high nutrient density and have been shown to promote positive health outcomes. This also can be done through a well-planned <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegetarian diet</a>. It's important to take both your food preferences and health concerns or goals into account.</p>



<p>So what about weight loss? Here's where calories are crucial. For example, even a Mediterranean diet does not guarantee weight loss if a calorie deficit is not present. Olive oil and nuts are excellent sources of healthy fat, but when eaten without one's total calorie intake in mind, it could, technically, cause weight gain. Using the style of eating that is best for you, consider working toward a 250-750 calorie per day deficit. This may be swapping your mid-afternoon snack for a piece of fruit or skipping your usual sweetened coffee or alcoholic beverage.</p>



<p>The body needs to burn more than it's consuming to produce weight loss. While exercise is always going to be recommended, it's important to remember that exercise alone is not likely to get most people into that roughly 500-calorie deficit. The majority of us will be most successful with weight loss through dietary changes.</p>



<p>Most diets work because adapting your baseline eating habits to fit a specific diet's protocol will likely cause you to eat fewer calories. Good news, right? Possibly. This is only going to benefit someone who can stay on said diet long term. Diets that endorse or require drastic and unrealistic changes (such as the cabbage soup diet) aren't sustainable. And when a diet is not sustainable, the weight loss won't be either.</p>



<p>So, start here:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose a healthful diet that fits your personal eating and health preferences.</li>



<li>Work toward a gradual calorie deficit, ideally limiting excess (more than you need) and empty (non-nutrition-providing) calories.</li>



<li>Remember that a slow, steady and sustainable approach is most likely to help you achieve a healthy weight. <span style="color: #000000"><em>—</em></span> <em><strong>Tara Schmidt, Registered Dietitian, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</strong></em></li>
