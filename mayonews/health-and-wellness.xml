<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I've never had my blood drawn before, but I have to go in for testing soon. Honestly, I'm pretty nervous about it. What can I expect?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> It can be a little nerve-wracking at first, but having blood drawn is a quick procedure that can be painless — sometimes, people don't even know that the collection has started!</p>



<p>It's important that you first ask your healthcare team what your lab tests are and why they're being collected. This can help you prepare and know what time of day to schedule your appointment. For example, if you need to be fasting prior to your blood draw, it may be preferable to schedule it first thing in the morning before you have eaten.</p>



<p>When it comes to the day of the blood collection, stay hydrated, stay warm and try to stay as calm as possible (try taking some deep breaths). The phlebotomist assigned to perform your blood draw you will ask you several questions before they get started, such as your date of birth and full name. There are often patients with similar-sounding names, so we try to ask for as many identifiers as we can to make sure we can confirm who you are. It's critical that our phlebotomists get the right blood from the right patient and get the results into the right medical record. Without the right specimens, we can't do our work.</p>



<p>The phlebotomist will ask you to make a fist and tap on your veins to identify a vein they can collect blood from. It's key for them to be able to not only see but feel a vein, make sure it's big enough and that it's not going to roll away from the needle during the collection. This is a skill that they get during their training and certification, and they become experts after many years of experience with patients. Clenching your fist increases the amount of blood that's in your vein, which then makes it more prominent and easier to see and feel.</p>



<p>Veins in your hands often have very thin walls, so it's difficult to get into the vein and not damage it. This is why you are more likely to get bruising on your hand. The veins that are in your elbow joint are very thick and easy to access, and they usually heal without much bruising, depending on the patient. Sometimes the veins in your hand are the only veins that the phlebotomist can identify, so then they'll have to use those.</p>



<p>All in all, it only takes one or two minutes for them to identify the vein, collect the specimens and make sure that you're healthy enough to leave. There's no need to eat right after a blood draw unless you've been fasting or you feel a bit woozy. Most people don't feel any different after a blood collection, but some do report being dizzy. This is unrelated to the amount of blood that's collected, though. You have plenty of blood in your body (approximately 5,000 milliliters) compared to what's being taken. Dizziness is usually the result of the patient being anxious or worried about the blood draw.</p>



<p>Your blood tells us a vast number of things, and blood testing can be very complex. Phlebotomists are incredibly important individuals whose work often goes unnoticed. All our testing relies on having your blood collected in the right way, which makes phlebotomists the foundation of our clinical practice. We couldn't run a hospital without them. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/craig-fiona-e-m-d/bio-20156652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fiona Craig, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix</em></strong></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="660" height="370" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/kids-crafting-outdoors-16x9-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-386449" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/kids-crafting-outdoors-16x9-1.jpg 660w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/kids-crafting-outdoors-16x9-1-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>Diagnosing a person with autism spectrum disorder can be challenging. It's a medical condition that no blood test, brain scan or objective test can pinpoint. And because of each person's distinctive pattern of symptoms, it can be hard to determine its severity.</p>



<p>As people gain familiarity with autism, however, they are becoming more open to discussing the diagnosis and seeking treatment. Society is also becoming more motivated to learn about neurodivergent conditions, including autism.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is autism spectrum disorder?</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352928" target="_blank">Autism spectrum disorder</a>&nbsp;is a condition related to brain development that affects how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. It includes conditions that previously were considered separate, including autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of pervasive developmental disorder.</p>



<p>Autism affects children and adults in three areas: communication, social interaction and behaviors. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/could-my-child-have-autism-spectrum-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Children with autism spectrum disorder</a> may struggle with recognizing their emotions and may feel them more intensely. Regulating their anger and frustration can be difficult and lead to intense bursts of emotions. Children with autism also have higher rates of anxiety and depression.</p>



<p>Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a distinctive pattern of behavior and level of severity. A healthcare professional will generally describe the severity of the condition based on the person's level of impairments and how those affect their ability to function.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Can't start a conversation, keep one going or can only start one to make requests or label items.</li>



<li>Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions.</li>



<li>Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings.</li>



<li>Doesn't speak or has delayed speech.</li>



<li>Fails to respond to their name or appears not to hear you sometimes.</li>



<li>Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice.</li>



<li>Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression.</li>



<li>Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive.</li>



<li>Prefers playing alone.</li>



<li>Repeats words or phrases verbatim but doesn't understand how to use them.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Awareness of autism behaviors</h2>



<p>According to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/23904/CDC-Autism-rate-rises-to-1-in-36-children" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, the latest research from 2023 shows that 1 in 36 children was diagnosed with autism. This is an increase from 1 in 44 children just&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/ss/ss7202a1.htm?s_cid=ss7202a1_e&amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM101985&amp;ACSTrackingLabel=This%20Week%20in%20MMWR%20-%20Vol.%2072%2C%20March%2024%2C%202023&amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM101985" target="_blank">two years ago</a>.</p>



<p>Children tend to become more aware of their diagnosis around puberty. Kids recognize their differences from their peers and notice their struggle to fit in. They might notice they're not being invited to participate in certain activities or being accepted in the same way as many of their peers. Social interactions become more crucial for young people in middle and high school, which can be stressful for someone on the autism spectrum.</p>



<p>Parents may notice symptoms early on when they see how their child's behaviors, communication and social interactions differ from their peer group. It can be challenging for parents to accept that their child is different from other children. Parents may feel guilty and responsible, even though this developmental condition has no known cause.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Living with autism spectrum disorder</h2>



<p>As the number of people living with autism spectrum disorder increases, it's critical to seek out educational opportunities that can help with understanding autism spectrum disorder. What are the strengths and disadvantages of the child? How can that knowledge be used to strengthen the skills of a child with autism? Answering these questions can help identify specific interventions to teach skills relevant to the child.</p>



<p>For example, if a child struggles with regulating emotions, this can be addressed through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/autism-treatments-and-therapies">treatment</a>&nbsp;to help them gain more control over their emotions and behaviors.</p>



<p>No cure exists for autism spectrum disorder, and there's no one-size-fits-all treatment. The goal of treatment is to maximize your child's ability to function by reducing their autism spectrum disorder symptoms and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/helping-your-childs-education-through-an-iep-or-504-plan">supporting their development and learning</a>. Early intervention during the preschool years is key.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment options may include:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Behavior and communication therapies</li>



<li>Educational therapies</li>



<li>Family therapies</li>



<li>Medications</li>
</ul>



<p>When you have a child or loved one with autism, the chance of them having anxiety or depression is increased. Evaluating and treating these symptoms can improve their level of functioning and their overall mental health.</p>



<p>One of the most critical things parents, friends or classmates of someone diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder can do is educate yourself about it while recognizing their strengths.</p>



<p>You can develop increased compassion for your loved ones, classmates, friends and colleagues by recognizing and understanding more about the condition. While you can't eliminate a child's autism or wait for them to outgrow it, you can minimize some of its symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>

Food also can be a distraction. If you're worried about an upcoming event or stewing over a conflict, for instance, you may focus on eating comfort food instead of dealing with the painful situation. </p>



<p>Emotional eating often leads to eating too much, especially overeating foods that are sweet, fatty and high in calories. And this can sabotage your weight-loss efforts. </p>



<p>When negative emotions threaten to trigger emotional eating, try these nine tips to stay on track:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Keep a food diary.<br></strong>Write down what you eat, how much you eat, when you eat, how you're feeling when you eat and how hungry you are. Over time, you might see patterns that reveal the connection between mood and food.</li><li><strong>Tame your stress.<br></strong>If stress contributes to your emotional eating, try a stress management technique, such as yoga, meditation or deep breathing.</li><li><strong>Have a hunger reality check.<br></strong>Is your hunger physical or emotional? If you ate just a few hours ago and don't have a rumbling stomach, you're probably not hungry. Give the craving time to pass.</li><li><strong>Get support.<br></strong>You're more likely to give in to emotional eating if you lack a good support network. Lean on family and friends, or consider joining a support group.</li><li><strong>Fight boredom.<br></strong>Instead of snacking when you're not hungry, distract yourself and substitute a healthier behavior. Take a walk, watch a movie, play with your pet, listen to music, read, surf the internet or call a friend.</li><li><strong>Remove temptation.<br></strong>Don't keep hard-to-resist comfort foods in your home. And if you feel angry or blue, postpone your trip to the grocery store until your emotions are in check.</li><li><strong>Don't deprive yourself.<br></strong>When trying to lose weight, you might limit calories too much, eat the same foods repeatedly and banish treats. This may just increase your food cravings, especially in response to emotions. Eat satisfying amounts of healthier foods, enjoy an occasional treat and get plenty of variety to curb cravings.</li><li><strong>Snack healthy.<br></strong>If you feel the urge to eat between meals, choose a healthy snack, such as fresh fruit, vegetables with low-fat dip, nuts or unbuttered popcorn. Or try lower-calorie versions of your favorite foods to see if they satisfy your craving.</li><li><strong>Learn from setbacks.<br></strong>If you have an episode of emotional eating, forgive yourself and start fresh the next day. Try to learn from the experience and plan for how you can prevent it in the future. Focus on the positive changes you're making in your eating habits and give yourself credit for making changes that will lead to better health.</li></ul>

<p>Bell's palsy causes sudden weakness in your facial muscles. This makes half of your face appear to droop. Your smile is one-sided, and your eye on that side resists closing.</p>
<p>Bell's palsy, also known as facial palsy, can occur at any age. The exact cause is unknown, but it's believed to be the result of swelling and inflammation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of your face. It may be a reaction that occurs after a viral infection.</p>
<p>For most people, Bell's palsy is temporary. Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. A small number of people continue to have some Bell's palsy symptoms for life. Rarely, Bell's palsy can recur.</p>
<h3>Signs and symptoms of Bell's palsy come on suddenly and may include:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rapid onset of mild weakness to total paralysis on one side of your face — occurring within hours to days</li>
<li>Facial droop and difficulty making facial expressions, such as closing your eye or smiling</li>
<li>Drooling</li>
<li>Pain around the jaw or in or behind your ear on the affected side</li>
<li>Increased sensitivity to sound on the affected side</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>A decrease in your ability to taste</li>
<li>Changes in the amount of tears and saliva you produce</li>
</ul>
<div id="adsmobileBottom">In rare cases, Bell's palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of your face.</div>
<h3><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-168062" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/07/Bells-palsy-facial-paralysis-3398230-052-0.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of an African American woman with Bell's palsy facial paralysis " width="548" height="685" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/07/Bells-palsy-facial-paralysis-3398230-052-0.jpg 632w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/07/Bells-palsy-facial-paralysis-3398230-052-0-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" />Causes</h3>
<div class="auto">
<div>Facial nerve</div>
</div>
<p>Although the exact reason Bell's palsy occurs isn't clear, it's often linked to exposure to a viral infection. Viruses that have been linked to Bell's palsy include the virus that causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cold sores and genital herpes (herpes simplex)</li>
<li>Chickenpox and shingles (herpes zoster)</li>
<li>Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr)</li>
<li>Cytomegalovirus infections</li>
<li>Respiratory illnesses (adenovirus)</li>
<li>German measles (rubella)</li>
<li>Mumps (mumps virus)</li>
<li>Flu (influenza B)</li>
<li>Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (coxsackievirus)</li>
</ul>
<div id="adsmobileBottom">With Bell's palsy, the nerve that controls your facial muscles, which passes through a narrow corridor of bone on its way to your face, becomes inflamed and swollen — usually related to a viral infection. Besides facial muscles, the nerve affects tears, saliva, taste and a small bone in the middle of your ear.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-168063" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/07/facial-paralysis-3091484-002-0.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of a man with facial paralysis " width="566" height="711" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/07/facial-paralysis-3091484-002-0.jpg 632w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/07/facial-paralysis-3091484-002-0-239x300.jpg 239w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<h3>Risk factors</h3>
<p>Bell's palsy occurs more often in people who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are pregnant, especially during the third trimester, or who are in the first week after giving birth</li>
<li>Have an upper respiratory infection, such as the flu or a cold</li>
<li>Have diabetes</li>
</ul>
<div id="adsmobileBottom"> Also, some people who have recurrent attacks of Bell's palsy, which are rare, have a family history of recurrent attacks. In those cases, there may be a genetic predisposition to Bell's palsy.</div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>When to see a doctor</h3>
<p>Seek immediate medical help if you experience any type of paralysis because you may be having a stroke. Bell's palsy is not caused by a stroke. See your doctor if you experience facial weakness or drooping to determine the underlying cause and severity of the illness.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-prescribing-nature-for-mental-physical-health/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Prescribing nature for mental, physical health</a></h2>



<p>Eating well and staying active are key to maintaining both mental and physical health. Rather than hitting the treadmill, try heading outside to enjoy the health benefits of nature. You might even find that your next doctor's visit includes a prescription for parks instead of pills.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/4-27-ready-mayo-clinic-minute-how-to-cope-with-irritable-bowel-syndrome/">Mayo Clinic Minute: How to cope with irritable bowel syndrome</a></h2>



<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can greatly interfere with a person's daily life. Some people endure silently due to painful stomach cramps, diarrhea, and constipation, all of which can substantially affect their quality of life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-using-lasers-on-the-brain-to-treat-seizures/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Using lasers on the brain to treat seizures</a></h2>



<p>About one-third of people with epilepsy do not achieve seizure control with medication. In cases where seizures originate in specific brain regions, laser therapy can be a viable option for both adults and children. It's treatment for epileptic seizures that uses a laser on the brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-treatment-and-research-of-glioblastoma/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Treatment and research of glioblastoma</a></h2>



<p>Glioblastoma, often regarded as the most aggressive form of brain cancer, grows rapidly, causing damage to healthy tissue. Despite notable progress in surgical techniques, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation technology, the prognosis for glioblastoma patients remains poor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/teamwork-and-a-new-nickname-inspire-patient-through-pancreatic-cancer-treatment/">Teamwork and a new nickname inspire patient through pancreatic cancer treatment</a></h2>



<p>In July 2021, Walter "Dick" Whetstone was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Doctors estimated he had four to six months to live. Dick decided, "If I'm going down, I'm going down fighting." He called Mayo Clinic. </p>



<p>"Within 10 days of me calling the number, I had connected with the care team at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic in Florida&nbsp;and was in Jacksonville for tests and appointments," Dick says. "Within the month, I was preparing for surgery."</p>

<p>The popularity of pickleball has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-study-identifies-increased-fracture-risk-for-older-pickleball-players-302058911.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploded</a>&nbsp;in the last few years, and according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-study-identifies-increased-fracture-risk-for-older-pickleball-players-302058911.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent report</a>, so have injuries attributed to the relatively new sport.</p>

<p>A common pickleball injury is a traumatic one — like a broken wrist.</p>



<p>"Sometimes the patients are a little bit older, they may have undiagnosed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">osteoporosis</a>, they fall over, they break their wrist, and we see actually a lot of those injuries," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>He says players can also face problems from overuse.</p>



<p>"For example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tendinitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378243?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tendinitis&nbsp;</a>type of injuries that when somebody plays, they're not conditioned to it," he says.</p>

<p>The goal is to prevent those type of problems in the first place. Dr. Kakar says to think of these three P's when heading to the court.</p>



<p>"Properly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/stretching/art-20546848?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warming</a>&nbsp;up, having proper equipment and also proper form," he explains.</p>



<p>Warm up by doing stretches before taking your first swing.</p>



<p>"It's not tennis, it's not squash, it's its own sport. So having proper equipment is important such as having a proper paddle, which is thicker so you are not gripping as hard," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>And when it comes to proper form, consider taking a lesson.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Mayo Clinic in Rochester was ranked No. 8 in the nation by&nbsp;Newsweek&nbsp;in its 2024 list of "<a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Frankings%2Famericas-best-fertility-clinics-2024&amp;data=05%7C02%7CSchauer.Ann%40mayo.edu%7C8e954d0a2ec049afe4da08dc5f0bde8d%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638489751788371402%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=WjJ4lMPlxgRTQnK46ysD40bxhwKbWMnP%2BSmUu9QkTrI%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">America's Best Fertility Clinics</a>." Mayo is one of 125 top fertility clinics in the U.S. to receive the honor.</p>



<p>The recently released rankings are based on survey results from physicians and other fertility medicine professionals, and key performance indicators and accreditation data to produce a listing of the top 125 fertility clinics in the country.</p>



<p>"As we proudly recognize the distinction of being ranked No. 8 among America's best fertility clinics by Newsweek, it's timely also to acknowledge that&nbsp;April 21–27 marks National Infertility Awareness Week," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/babayev-samir-m-d/bio-20466633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Samir Babayev</a>, clinical director of in vitro fertilization in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility.</p>



<p>"This recognition underscores our team's relentless commitment to advancing fertility care," Dr. Babyev says. "At Mayo Clinic, we are not just celebrating a ranking. We are reaffirming our dedication to helping families overcome their challenges with fertility, bolstered by pioneering research and compassionate care. It's an honor to support our patients' dreams of parenthood, inspired by both our team's expertise and the stories of those we serve."</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/reproductive-endocrinology-and-infertility-in-minnesota/overview/ovc-20424328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility team</a>&nbsp;understands the challenges of infertility and has been committed to advancing fertility care since 1989. The team is made up of dedicated nurses, clinicians and embryologists who can relate to the struggles of families both locally and worldwide.</p>

<cite>Dr. Samir Babayev</cite></blockquote>



<p>"I've witnessed firsthand the passion and commitment of our team," says&nbsp;Nicole Callahan, a nurse practitioner on the team. "We're not just providing top-notch care but also helping and advocating for those struggling with infertility. It's more than just a job; it's a mission to make a difference in people's lives."</p>



<p>The team has extensive experience and a commitment to fertility care, and has the advantage of having a specialized reproductive surgery and leading-edge in vitro fertilization laboratory equipped with advanced technologies.</p>



<p>"Our state-of-the-art in vitro fertilization and fertility testing laboratories provide a broad range of services for patients seeking infertility treatment and family building,"&nbsp;says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zhao-yulian-m-d-ph-d/bio-20441150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Yulian Zhao</a>, director of the In Vitro Fertilization Laboratory.</p>



<p>"In addition to performing the core procedures of IVF with the most advanced technologies, our fertility preservation program goes above and beyond to preserve fertility for all ages and gender groups on all reproductive cells and tissues," Dr. Zhao says. "Our dedicated staff and team effort truly make Mayo's model of putting the patient first a reality. Recognition of excellence is well merited."&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/khan-zaraq-m-b-b-s/bio-20206072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Zaraq Khan,</a> division chair of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, also expresses pride in the recognition.</p>



<p>"We are thrilled to be in the top 10 of America's Best Fertility Clinics," Dr. Khan says. "This recognition is a testament to the hard work of all our division members, with our mission of providing unparalleled excellence through innovative and compassionate fertility care. We remain committed to helping our patients in their family-building journey, from basic infertility treatment to medically complex IVF and advanced reproductive surgery."</p>

<p>Saturday, April 27, is the next Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) <a href="https://www.dea.gov/takebackday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Prescription Drug Take Back Day</a>. Staff, patients and community members are encouraged to <a href="https://apps.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/NTBI/NTBI-PUB.pub;jsessionid=RyLFklmQmPl-JqUPlD2kwr3n9DjIVQnRg5CfCgnw.web1?_flowExecutionKey=_c723AA589-5B2E-9516-C23A-30CEDE9B16A7_kF9EA3DB9-56DF-B483-D5B8-4EBEE8ACD443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attend a local event</a> and drop off unused and expired drugs.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic in Florida is hosting a drop-off site in cooperation with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> April 27</li>



<li><strong>Time:</strong> 10 a.m.–2 p.m.</li>



<li><strong>Drop-Off Site:</strong> Mayo Clinic, Davis Building, drive-thru entrance off Mayo Blvd.</li>
</ul>



<p>There will be pharmacists and other healthcare professionals on-site, able to provide more information about drug misuse and abuse.</p>



<p>Medications accepted for safe disposal at take-back locations include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Prescription drugs</li>



<li>Over-the-counter medications</li>



<li>Ointments, patches, creams, inhalers and vials</li>



<li>Pet medications</li>



<li>Nonaerosol medications</li>
</ul>



<p>Liquid medications must be in the original container. Vape pens and other e-cigarette devices are accepted with the batteries removed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This is an easy but really important way to keep ourselves, our families and our community healthier and safer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ardon-tina-m-d/bio-20055713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Tina Ardon</a>, a family medicine physician and chair of the Controlled Substances and Pain Oversight Team at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "Regularly cleaning out your medicine cabinet reduces the likelihood of misuse or poisoning. Properly disposing of unused or expired drugs also lessens the likelihood of environmental harm."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Every Day is Take Back Day</strong></h2>



<p>Drop-off events are held around the U.S. every April and October. However, in an extension of their long-running theme, the DEA now shares that "<a href="https://www.dea.gov/everyday-takeback-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Every Day is Take Back Day</a>," and Mayo is embracing that idea.</p>



<p>"We want to move awareness to the next level," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lai-benjamin-m-b-b-ch-b-a-o/bio-20502247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Benjamin Lai</a>, a family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and chair of Mayo Clinic's Opioid Stewardship Program. "Keeping leftover opioids, expired cold medicine and other unused drugs around the house can be dangerous. Why not lessen the chance of harm by safely disposing of these the next time you visit your pharmacy or drive by your local police station?"</p>



<p>There are permanent drop boxes co-located with many Mayo Clinic pharmacies:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Florida</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Davis Building, Main Level</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rochester pharmacies with a co-located drop box</strong></h3>

<p><em><strong>Editors note</strong>: <a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-malaria-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Malaria Day</a> will be observed Thursday, April 25.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/malaria/symptoms-causes/syc-20351184?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malaria</a>&nbsp;is caused by a single-celled parasite of the genus&nbsp;<em>Plasmodium</em>.

The malaria parasites enter the bloodstream and travel to the liver. When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect red blood cells. This is when people typically develop malaria symptoms. Because the parasites that cause malaria affect red blood cells, people also can be infected by exposure to infected blood, including from mother to unborn child, through blood transfusions and by sharing needles used to inject drugs.</p>



<p>Each year, nearly 290 million people are infected with malaria, and more than 400,000 people die of the disease. The greatest risk factor for developing malaria is to live in or visit areas where the disease is common. These areas include tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, Central America, and northern South America. The degree of risk depends on local malaria control, seasonal changes in malaria rates and the precautions you take to prevent mosquito bites.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms of malaria</strong></h2>



<p>Signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin within a few weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito. However, some types of malaria parasites can lie dormant in your body for up to a year. Some people who have malaria experience cycles of malaria "attacks." An attack usually starts with shivering and chills, followed by a high fever, then sweating, and finally a return to normal temperature.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of malaria can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fever</li>



<li>Chills</li>



<li>General feeling of discomfort</li>



<li>Headache</li>



<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>



<li>Diarrhea</li>



<li>Abdominal pain</li>



<li>Muscle or joint pain</li>



<li>Fatigue</li>



<li>Rapid breathing</li>



<li>Rapid heart rate</li>



<li>Cough</li>
</ul>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment and prevention</strong></p>

The types of drugs and the length of treatment will depend on the type of malaria parasite you have, the severity of your symptoms, your age and whether you're pregnant. </p>



<p>To reduce malaria infections, world health programs distribute preventive drugs and insecticide-treated bed nets to protect people from mosquito bites. Protective clothing, bed nets and insecticides can protect you while traveling. You also can take preventive medicine before, during and after a trip to a high-risk area.</p>



<p>In 2021, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/06-10-2021-who-recommends-groundbreaking-malaria-vaccine-for-children-at-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;(WHO) recommended widespread use of a new malaria vaccine for children. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the long-awaited vaccine a "breakthrough for science, child health and malaria control," and said that when combined with existing tools to prevent malaria, tens of thousands of children could be saved each year.</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note:</strong> Earth Day is Monday, April 22</em></p>



<p>Eating right and exercising are important ways to stay mentally and physically healthy. And instead of getting off the couch and hopping on a treadmill, you might want to consider going outdoors and reaping the health benefits of being in nature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And don't be surprised at your next doctor's visit when you get a prescription for parks instead of pills.</p>

<p>Being outdoors in nature is an important factor in staying healthy. It's a concept called biophilia.</p>



<p>"Biophilia means that we are wired to be connected to nature — that there's something healthy about having nature either in our presence or us being present in nature," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bauer-brent-a-m-d/bio-20053095?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Brent Bauer</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/general-internal-medicine/sections/overview/ovc-20461602?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general internal medicine</a> physician at Mayo Clinic. "There's actually a lot of research on this topic. So it's no longer just, 'Nature sounds good.' We know it's actually really good. Those studies range from evaluating people who are in a city and then taken into a forest. What happens to blood pressure? What happens to heart rate? And in many, many studies, we do much better in the natural environment."</p>



<p>Which is why some healthcare professionals are writing "park prescriptions."</p>



<p>"It's kind of, I think, heightening the importance of getting out into nature. More than just saying we should. Now we actually have a prescription," says Dr. Bauer.</p>



<p>Studies suggest the best dose of nature is at least two hours a week. And if you can't get outside, bring the nature indoors.</p>



<p>"There's still plenty of benefits to listening to bird songs, listening to nature sounds, having a water fountain — just having elements around you that are made of stone and wood," says Dr. Bauer.</p>
