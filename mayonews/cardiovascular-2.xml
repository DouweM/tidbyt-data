<p>Women experience menopause at different ages — and different ways — which can, among other things, affect their heart health.</p>



<p>The average age of natural menopause in the U.S is 52. There's early menopause, under age 45, and premature menopause, under age 40, which may affect a very small group of women. There is also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-ovarian-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20354683?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">premature ovarian insufficiency</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"There are different ages that women can go into menopause. And that impacts heart health as well," says Dr. Shufelt.</p>



<p>Different ages because there are different ways you can go into menopause.</p>



<p>"Menopause can be natural, or it can be surgical removal of the ovaries. It doesn't necessarily mean removal of the uterus. It just means removal of the ovaries," she says.</p>



<p>Medication or therapies, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy,</a>&nbsp;can induce menopause as well.</p>



<p>"The earlier a woman goes into menopause, whether it's natural or whether it's surgically induced, or whether it's chemotherapy or medication induced, the higher the risk for future heart attacks are," says Dr. Shufelt.</p>



<p>And that's an ideal time to get your heart health assessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It emphasizes plant-based foods, olive oil as the main fat source, moderate intake of fresh fish, seafood, dairy and poultry, and limited consumption of red meat and sweets.</p>



<p>Follow these tips to get started:</p>



<ul>
<li>Build meals around vegetables, beans and whole grains.</li>



<li>Eat fish at least twice a week.</li>



<li>Use olive oil instead of butter in preparing food.</li>



<li>Serve fresh fruit for dessert.</li>

<p><strong>Rich Bugay had an appointment with the </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology</strong></a><strong> at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on a Monday, where he had hoped to get answers and relief for what he thought was refractory <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-healthcare-expert-explains-why-reflux-disease-isnt-just-heartburn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acid reflux </a>— until his doctor discovered a heart murmur. The next morning, Rich was told he had congenital heart disease and a severely dilated aorta that could rupture. Just two days later, Rich underwent lifesaving heart surgery. After a whirlwind four days, Rich was on the road to recovery.<br>___________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>



<p>Rich Bugay, an HVAC business owner, husband, and father to two children, hadn't been feeling well for over a year. What started out as sinus issues gradually turned into severe acid reflux and exhaustion, making it hard for Rich to get through the workday.</p>



<p>"I wasn't feeling well — I had a lot of acid reflux and stomach discomfort. I had been going to a lot of different doctor visits, like my family practitioner, and I wasn't getting any answers," says Rich. "And so, at some point, I decided I wanted to go to the best place I could go."</p>

<p>Rich and his wife, Lori, left their house in Escanaba, Michigan, and drove more than six hours to Mayo Clinic in Rochester for an appointment with Dr. Houssam Halawi, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist.</p>



<p>During the appointment, Dr. Halawi listened to Rich's history, concerns and symptoms.</p>



<p>"And what caught my attention was, he had a lot of different symptoms that didn't really belong in the GI (gastrointestinal) world," says Dr. Halawi. "And at that point, in my mind, I was thinking this is not an acid reflux problem."</p>

<p>When Dr. Halawi listened to Rich's heart, he heard a suspicious murmur. He knew something — potentially big — was going on, and he recommended that Rich receive an urgent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856#:~:text=An%20echocardiogram%20uses%20sound%20waves%20to%20create%20pictures%20of%20the,disease%20and%20other%20heart%20conditions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>. An echocardiogram is a common test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart to find heart disease and other heart conditions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich was hesitant to have the echocardiogram since he just wanted some relief from his presumed acid reflux and didn't think he had a life-threatening issue.</p>



<p>Knowing that Rich would most likely go home if the echocardiogram couldn't be scheduled quickly, Dr. Halawi asked the scheduling team if there was any way they could arrange the echocardiogram for the next day. When the scheduler asked, "Would tomorrow morning work for you?" Dr. Halawi didn't expect it to be that quick.</p>



<p>Rich and Lori decided to stay at Mayo Clinic for the echocardiogram the next morning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-388596" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Jain meeting with Rich</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Confirming suspicions</h2>



<p>Kylie Marvin, the sonographer who performed the echocardiogram, immediately noticed something was seriously wrong. She walked out into the hallway and informed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jain-c-charles-m-d/bio-20543120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Charles Jain</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, about her findings.</p>



<p>"His aorta was severely dilated, well over what we would traditionally consider as the surgical cutoff for elective intervention," says Dr. Jain.</p>



<p>A severely enlarged aorta — the pipe that delivers blood out of the heart — could have acute complications, such as a rupture, which can be life-threatening.</p>



<p>The echocardiogram also showed that Rich had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bicuspid-aortic-valve/cdc-20385577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bicuspid aortic valve</a>.</p>



<p>The aortic valve usually has three cusps. A bicuspid valve has only two cusps. Rich's bicuspid valve wasn't closing tightly, which was causing blood to flow backward.</p>



<p>Dr. Jain called a radiologist and arranged an urgent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> for Rich that same day. The results of the CT scan confirmed the findings, and Dr. Jain called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bagameri-gabor-m-d/bio-20384030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gabor Bagameri,</a> a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular surgeon, who was willing to make room in his schedule to quickly see Rich and arrange for surgery.</p>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic, the needs of the patient always come first, and even in the middle of the night, 24/7, you can always reach for help," says Dr. Bagameri.</p>



<p>He encouraged Rich that his heart problems were fixable and advised him not to wait to undergo surgery.</p>



<p>"He let me think about it and came back into the room about five minutes later and he says, 'OK, so we're going to do this Thursday, right?' I say, 'You know it.' And he says, 'I knew you were going to say that!' So, we were ready," says Rich.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"Like a well-oiled machine<strong>"</strong></h2>



<p>On the day of the surgery, Rich said everything was very structured and organized. The surgery itself was a success, as was his hospital stay.</p>



<p>"Like a well-oiled machine, everything just went so well, so smoothly," says Lori. "I've never experienced anything like that before, and that's how healthcare should be everywhere. Everyone deserves to be treated like they do here."</p>



<p>Now, nearly six months after his procedure, Rich feels almost 100% better.</p>



<p>"They saved my life," says Rich. "I'm a completely different person — I feel like a million bucks. I can do what I want to do, and my energy levels are much better."</p>



<p>Looking back on the experience, Dr. Halawi recognizes that Rich wouldn't have had such a positive outcome without every single person involved at Mayo Clinic. Dr. Jain echoes that sentiment, "When there are patients who are having a significant abnormality, particularly with urgency, such as Rich's, everything is already set up for teamwork to be natural, and fortunately, this makes it all relatively seamless."</p>



<p>Reflecting on his healthcare journey, Rich says that you need to advocate for yourself.</p>



<p>"If you haven’t been feeling right for a long time and feel like you're not getting answers, come to Mayo Clinic because they'll get to the bottom of it," says Rich.</p>

Understanding and managing these risks can help prevent both conditions.</p>



<p>“We target things like high blood pressure, hypertension, high cholesterol or hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, obstructive sleep apnea. We think about things like physical inactivity and obesity," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/english-stephen-w-jr-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20491968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stephen English</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/neurology/home/orc-20117057?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurologist</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. English says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a>, a type of heart disease causing an abnormal heart rhythm, contributes to nearly 20% of stroke cases.</p>



<p>"Atrial fibrillation is something we can modify with medications based on the burden of your atrial fibrillation," he says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Not all risks for heart disease and stroke can be modified — for example, getting older.</p>



<p>"Even perfectly healthy people, as we age, develop changes, so our blood vessels become stiffer over time. And we're more at risk of developing things like atrial fibrillation as we age," says Dr. English.</p>

<p>Damian Di Florio, Ph.D., remembers the lightning-bolt moment five years ago when he began thinking differently about the questions scientists ask. He was a summer undergraduate student working in the lab of cardiovascular researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fairweather-delisa-ph-d/bio-20320752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeLisa Fairweather, Ph.D.</a>, when she and another scientist gave a lecture about vitamin D. The lab's studies had found stark differences between how vitamin D affects the heart function of male and female models of disease.</p>



<p>"That was the first alarm bell for me," says Dr. Di Florio, who recently completed his Ph.D. in Clinical and Translational Science at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> under Dr. Fairweather's mentorship. "It made sense that sex differences would be an important feature of biology to consider in any type of research, and especially in cardiovascular disorders, which women and men experience differently."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A disease more deadly in men</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/DeLisaFairweatherPhD.jpg" alt="Image of DeLisa Fairweather, Ph.D." class="wp-image-388696" style="width:205px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/DeLisaFairweatherPhD.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/DeLisaFairweatherPhD-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">DeLisa Fairweather, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Fairweather has long studied myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that's set off by a viral infection and can result in heart failure. The disease is rare, but it predominantly affects men under age 40. It can reduce the heart's ability to pump and can even be instantly fatal. Several viruses, including SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are known to set off the inflammatory process, but no disease-specific tools exist to detect myocarditis in its early stages.</p>



<p>For Dr. Fairweather, who serves as director for translational research for the Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, a key research goal is using the preclinical model of myocarditis that she developed to depict the disease process and provide new information relevant to human disease. She closely examines data for differences between males and females, including immune signaling which is affected by hormonal differences.</p>



<p>Translational research studies the mechanisms of disease with the goal of finding cures. Dr. Fairweather's lab aims to develop diagnostic tools and treatments that are tailored appropriately to men and women. "The mechanism of what's causing disease differs by sex," she says. "We should be looking for treatments according to that framework."</p>



<p>The perspective helped shape Dr. Di Florio's graduate work and it also yielded important results. "If we had not analyzed a certain data set by sex, we would have missed some of the most important and interesting features of that data," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Differences in genes that affect the heart</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/DamianDiFlorioPhD.jpg" alt="Image of Damian Di Florio, Ph.D." class="wp-image-388697" style="width:198px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/DamianDiFlorioPhD.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/DamianDiFlorioPhD-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Damian Di Florio, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>During his Ph.D. research, Dr. Di Florio found differences in the male and female responses to viral infection, including genes activated during acute stages of myocarditis. He looked at genes affecting the energy-producing structures in cells — organelles known as mitochondria — that are especially essential in a pumping heart. He found female mice with myocarditis have genes engaged that help mitochondria function; males have the same genes turned off. The lab is characterizing the genes, aiming to identify a target they can manipulate with the goal of making the genes more active in males during the disease process.</p>



<p>Dr. Di Florio also explored whether there might be sex-based variations in how myocarditis affects the pumping of the heart. Using three-dimensional echocardiography, he <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223025701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> that both male and female mice showed a reduction in blood squeezed out of the heart, a measurement known as ejection fraction. But when it came to the motion that pushes blood from the heart and to the rest of the body, a force known as global latitudinal strain, males showed worse function than females. Further, that pumping difference correlated with the presence of immune cells in the heart — a sign of inflammation. The findings suggest that measuring global longitudinal strain could be the basis to develop a much-needed clinical test to detect myocarditis at an early stage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A step toward treatment</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="434" height="533" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/DanielleBeetlerPhD.jpg" alt="Image of Danielle Beetler, Ph.D." class="wp-image-388698" style="width:213px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/DanielleBeetlerPhD.jpg 434w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/DanielleBeetlerPhD-244x300.jpg 244w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Danielle Beetler, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>During her graduate studies in Clinical and Translational Science, Danielle Beetler, Ph.D., looked at a potential treatment for myocarditis using particles that exist in the body. Her work in Dr. Fairweather's lab also took sex differences into account, focusing on the fact that the symptoms in women with myocarditis tend to be less severe than those in men.</p>



<p>"The idea was that maybe women who are most protected from these cardiovascular conditions have some kind of messaging in their body that can be applied in the context of male-driven disease," says Dr. Beetler, who also graduated this year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Her experiments looked at extracellular vesicles, or EVs — tiny "envelopes" that are shed by cells and contain molecular messages, including mRNA. The studies <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.202303317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> EVs from healthy donors not only shut down the replication of the virus and reduced damage caused by the immune system, but also protected cardiac function. The research also found that the effect of the EVs differed by age and sex of the donor. The researchers speculate that some donors may have had an undetected infection, suggesting that specialized screening would be necessary in the development of a therapy. "The studies overall are a step toward a novel, biocompatible treatment for myocarditis and maybe other cellular messaging-related diseases," says Dr. Beetler.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An outlook that could change medicine</strong></h2>



<p>The National Institutes of Health granting system has a <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sites/orwh/files/docs/NOT-OD-15-102_Guidance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">policy</a> for researchers to include consideration of sex as a biological variable in clinical and preclinical studies. Dr. Fairweather and her mentees are committed to this approach for the benefit of patients. She believes a close examination of sex differences will lead to better biomarkers for diseases that predominantly affect men, such as heart disease, and those that predominantly affect women, such as autoimmune diseases, which she also studies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research in her lab looks at sex differences in other cardiovascular conditions, particularly disease pathways that overlap with myocarditis. The lab has recently developed a new model of cardiovascular injury that can occur during cancer treatment. During chest radiation, a patient may incur damage to the heart and later develop cardiomyopathy, a disorder that interferes with the heart's ability to pump. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/EmilyWhelan.jpg" alt="Image of Emily Whelan" class="wp-image-388699" style="width:199px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/EmilyWhelan.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/EmilyWhelan-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Emily Whelan</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Emily Whelan, a second-year student in the Clinical and Translational Science graduate track, is looking for genes that may differ by sex and may affect inflammatory and functional responses to injury. The goal is to identify early indicators of cardiomyopathy and possible therapeutic targets, and to improve guidelines for diagnosis and surveillance.</p>



<p>For Dr. Di Florio, who is continuing his research as a postdoctoral fellow at Mayo Clinic, sex differences are now part of his thinking as a researcher and are how he'll evaluate data in future studies. </p>



<p>"The approach has the benefit of more precisely describing mechanisms of disease," he says. "It also has far-reaching sociological implications for how to more justly study and treat disease. It's information we absolutely need to address the biological differences that affect how frequently disease occurs, how severe the damage is and how well the body handles injury."</p>

<p>"Sitting for eight hours or more a day is almost as bad as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day in terms of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353124?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovasc</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353124?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">ular health</a> or risk," expresses Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>He says not everyone can break for exercise. Having an active workstation can be a solution.</p>

<p>"An active workstation could be a desk where you can just stand or stand and move around, or stand and walk, or biking or pedaling, or using a stepper," he says.</p>



<p>You can do this intermittently, alternating with sitting. Whether answering emails, video calls or working on projects, keep moving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It allows the user to work to be productive, and, at the same time, burn some calories," Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says.</p>



<p>And you don't have to be active all day to see the benefits.</p>



<p>"As long as you don't sit for more than three or four hours throughout the day, I think that will be a good goal," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>There are several ways to do intermittent fasting. The 16:8 method is popular. This involves eating during an eight-hour window daily. Many dieters do this by skipping breakfast.</p>



<p>"It actually became popular because studies on fruit flies show that when you restrict the calories, the flies will actually live longer. But we are not flies," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>Time-restrictive dieting can promote weight loss, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation. However, some research shows this practice could possibly increase cardiovascular risks.</p>



<p>"This recent study actually showed that those people practicing intermittent fasting are twice as likely of dying from heart disease or dying in general than those who don't practice this," explains Dr. Lopez-Jimenez. The reasons behind the risk factors are unclear. Before trying intermittent fasting, it's a good idea to check with your healthcare team.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The three most popular intermittent fasting methods are:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Alternate day fasting.</li>



<li>5-2 fasting. Eat normal for five days and restrict calories for two days.</li>



<li>Daily time-restricted fasting.</li>

<p>"It's usually recommended for you to sleep at least seven hours per night in order to allow your body to recover to be ready for the following day," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical steps to help you get better sleep</strong></h2>



<p>"Try to sleep at the same time. Try to get a schedule in which you're going to sleep at the same time and you're waking up also at the same time, that's very important," Dr. Cardenas Rosales says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Create good sleep habits</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Keep the time you go to bed and the time you wake up the same every day, including weekends.</li>



<li>Stay active. Regular activity can lead to a good night's sleep.</li>



<li>Limit naps or do not nap at all.</li>



<li>Limit or do not use caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.</li>



<li>Do not eat large meals or drink a lot of fluids before bed.</li>



<li>Make your bedroom comfortable.</li>



<li>Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading or listening to soft music.</li>
</ul>



<p>"You want to set up the environment to make it easier for your body to fall asleep," he says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I'm in the first trimester of my pregnancy, and I know that heart disease runs in my family. What are the warning signs of heart failure during pregnancy? How can I safely manage or prevent this?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>First of all, congratulations on being proactive and voicing your concern for yourself and your baby. There are some specific <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular</a> conditions, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>, which occur during pregnancy. Symptoms from this can overlap with normal pregnancy symptoms such as swelling of the legs, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/expert-answers/swelling-during-pregnancy/faq-20058467#:~:text=Although%20mild%20foot%20and%20ankle,pressure%20is%20higher%20than%20normal." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ankles</a> and feet, and shortness of breath while lying in bed at night on your back and while walking short distances. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to tell if the symptoms are from normal pregnancy or signs of heart failure. If you are concerned about any of these symptoms, especially if they worsen, please discuss them with your healthcare team early on, and they can determine if any testing might be needed.</p>



<p>During pregnancy, we recommend the same things that we would if a woman were not pregnant, which is following all the guidelines to ensure ideal or optimal cardiovascular health. Don't smoke, eat a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-nutrition/art-20045082#:~:text=During%20pregnancy%2C%20the%20basic%20principles,lean%20protein%20and%20healthy%20fats." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy diet</a> and maintain a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-weight-gain/art-20044360">healthy weight</a> (which is somewhat different for pregnancy because there is a normal amount of weight gain expected). Getting enough <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/womens-wellness-sleep-tips-during-pregnancy/">sleep</a> is also important. Seven to eight hours of sleep at night is recommended for ideal heart health. You'll want to make sure that you're getting specific things checked by your healthcare team during pregnancy, including your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy/art-20046098#:~:text=High%20blood%20pressure%20during%20pregnancy%20poses%20the%20following%20risks%3A,birth%20weight%20or%20premature%20birth." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/glucose-tolerance-test/about/pac-20394296#:~:text=Gestational%20diabetes,-If%20you're&amp;text=At%20Mayo%20Clinic%2C%20if%20your,be%20diagnosed%20with%20gestational%20diabetes." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood glucose</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cholesterol-test/about/pac-20384601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood lipids</a>. If treatment is needed, act on it as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>We also get questions about <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-exercises/art-20546799#:~:text=Staying%20active%20during%20pregnancy%20can,a%20well%2Drounded%20exercise%20program." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise for pregnant women</a>. If you were exercising before getting pregnant, it is usually safe to continue the same level of activity that you had before pregnancy. If you were not exercising before pregnancy and want to start an exercise program, it's important to check in with your healthcare team first. Start small and slow — don't push yourself too quickly.</p>



<p>Heart failure can be challenging to diagnose during pregnancy. We also know that a delay in the diagnosis of heart failure during this time also contributes significantly to the risk of dying from heart failure. Currently, there is no recommended single test to identify heart failure during pregnancy. The diagnosis often requires your healthcare team to assess your symptoms in addition to other clinical signs and consider testing which may include an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)</a>, blood test, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chest-x-rays/about/pac-20393494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest X-ray</a> and a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart ultrasound</a>. This is why we are working on a research study that utilizes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ai-cardiology/overview/ovc-20486648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artificial intelligence</a> to analyze data from an ECG to predict the likelihood of cardiac dysfunction or heart failure. This test is simple, readily available in most clinics, rapid (can be done within 10-30 seconds) and, most importantly, safe for you and your baby. The test provides a prediction that can tell you if a woman is at high risk for heart failure or not.</p>



<p>Based on our preliminary studies, we have evidence showing this test is very effective. If we can demonstrate its usefulness in larger research studies, we believe that this test can lead to a major shift in how we care for pregnant and postpartum women. <em><strong>— </strong></em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20502753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Demilade Adedinsewo, M.B., Ch.B.</strong></a><strong><em>, Cardiovascular Medicine, </em></strong><em><strong>Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I recently had a CAT scan of my chest as an evaluation for pneumonia. I didn’t have pneumonia, but I got an unexpected high calcium score in my coronary arteries. Does the calcium I eat affect this? I thought calcium was related to bone health? Now I'm being evaluated for my risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>. Should others in my family get their calcium score?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-scan/about/pac-20384686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary calcium scan</a> is a risk assessment tool that helps your healthcare team recommend if measures are needed to lower your risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>. The scan may show the presence of disease even before someone has symptoms, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/definition/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a> and fatigue.</p>



<p>Calcium from the foods we eat or calcium supplements do not have a significant impact on coronary artery calcification.</p>



<p>A coronary calcium scan predicts your amount of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atherosclerosis</a>, which is cholesterol and other substances that build up and narrow your arteries and can potentially cause a blood clot. Calcium is present in this buildup, called coronary plaque. The more calcium you have in your coronary arteries, the more plaque you have. The more plaque, the higher your risk for coronary artery disease.</p>



<p>The coronary calcium scan starts with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> of your chest that measures calcification in the arteries that feed your heart. It's typically a one-time test that combines a series of X-ray images of your body. If calcification is found, we usually don't repeat the test. If zero calcification is found, we would repeat the scan a few years later to see if the score changes.</p>



<p>Scores must be interpreted in the context of a person's age and other individual risk factors. For the most part, when calcium gets in your arteries, it stays there; it doesn't get removed. But by lowering your cholesterol level through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/cholesterol/art-20045192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diet</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/statins/art-20045772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medications</a>, the cholesterol gets removed and the plaque stabilizes.</p>



<p>Nowadays a calcium score can be derived from any chest CT scan, if no contrast dye is used. In your case, a chest CT scan for pneumonia also showed a high calcium score, even though that was not the initial intent of the test. I commend your healthcare team for using your calcium result to offer you follow-up assessment and possible treatment based on your risk of a heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>Certain people do not need to get their calcium score. For example, for people who already take a cholesterol medication or who have had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angioplasty/about/pac-20384761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stent</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-bypass-surgery/about/pac-20384589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery bypass surgery</a>, a calcium score is not needed. In those situations, they already are taking steps to reduce their risk.</p>



<p>People with a family history of heart disease may want to discuss a coronary calcium scan with their healthcare specialist. For example, if you have first-degree relatives who have had <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attacks</a>, but your cholesterol is not high, a superficial risk assessment may say you're at low risk. A calcium score is going to be able to evaluate risk more precisely and indicate if additional testing should be done. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/fernandes-regis-i-m-d/bio-20305254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Regis Fernandes, M.D.</strong></em></a><em>,<strong> Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix</strong></em></p>

<p>Preventing a stroke is a crucial aspect of healthcare, as about 80% of all strokes are preventable. The focus is on managing risk factors to reduce the long-term risk of stroke.</p>



<p>A stroke results from a blocked or torn blood vessel that decreases blood flow to the brain. In the U.S., stroke is a leading cause of death and disability.</p>



<p>“Because about 80% of all strokes are preventable, we really focus on prevention,” says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/english-stephen-w-jr-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20491968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stephen English</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/neurology/home/orc-20117057?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurologist</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing stroke risks</h2>



<p>Tips for lowering stroke risk include maintaining blood pressure under 130/80 and keeping cholesterol and blood glucose at appropriate levels.</p>



<p>"(Other modifiable risks include) things like smoking cessation, treatment of sleep apnea with a CPAP device, and some other potential treatments," he says. "We want to make sure that the risk factors are mitigated to help reduce the long-term risk of stroke."</p>



<p>There are risk factors for stroke that cannot be changed. These include age, sex, race and family history. “There are four nonmodifiable risk factors we typically think about. The first is age, so age greater than 55; males; people that have a family history of prior stroke; and then people that are of African American descent,” says Dr. English.</p>
