<p><br>Damage to these nerves needs to be cared for in a timely manner to avoid problems. Dr. Noland says if too much time has passed, then the options become more limited for repair and reconstruction.<br></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment options</h3>



<p>The most common&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brachial-plexus-injury/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350241?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surgical options</a>&nbsp;are nerve reconstruction, nerve repair, nerve grafting and nerve transfers.<br></p>



<p>"We treat brachial plexus injuries primarily through the use of what's called a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brachial-plexus-injury/multimedia/nerve-transfer/img-20008552?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerve transfer</a>. And a nerve transfer can be thought of as rewiring the injured nerves with good nerves that are nearby and functioning, but also expendable," says Dr. Noland.<br><br>Postoperative rehabilitation or physical therapy are crucial to healing.<br><br>"That includes what I like to think of as rewiring the brain and training the brain for the new function. So essentially training one nerve to perform the function of another nerve," she says.</p>

<p>When a simple hand movement, such as making a fist or moving the thumb, becomes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wrist-pain/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20366215">painful,</a> it could be from daily overuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"One of the most common is something called de Quervain's tenosynovitis," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>He says it's primarily a tendon problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If you think of the wrist, basically what we have here is that we have the tendons, which move your thumb. And they are covered by this band, and this is natural. We all have this, but in certain patients, they can have inflammation in this area," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>When the tendons underneath this band become inflamed, they can cause intense pain.</p>



<p>"Now, luckily, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/de-quervains-tenosynovitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371337">treatment</a> for this is relatively straightforward."</p>



<p>Hand therapy and wearing a splint may help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Sometimes we need to do a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cortisone-shots/about/pac-20384794?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">corticosteroid injection</a> to decrease inflammation, and most of the times, it gets better. But sometimes we need to do surgery," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>It's an outpatient procedure that involves opening the sheath surrounding the tendon to release pressure, and allow the tendons to glide more freely and pain-free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Bernard Morrey, M.D., professor, emeritus chair of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Mayo Clinic and former member of the Mayo Clinic Board of Governors, was recently named a 2023 "Pillar of the Orthopaedic Profession" by the American Orthopaedic Association (AOA).</p>



<p>Dr. Morrey is recognized for his leadership, mentoring and lifelong contributions to the orthopedic&nbsp;community. He practiced at Mayo Clinic from 1978 to 2009, specializing in elbow, hip and knee surgery.</p>



<p>"[At Mayo] we became interested in an 'unknown joint,' which was the elbow, and that kind of set me in my career academically, along with hip and knee surgery," Dr. Morrey says in AOA's tribute video. "The career is reflected in the opportunity to help individuals from all walks of life regain their function, which is what orthopedics is all about."</p>



<p>Dr. Morrey attended medical school at the University of Texas Medical Branch and completed his residency at Mayo Clinic. He was named a distinguished alumnus of Mayo Clinic and emeritus John and Posy Krehbiel Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at Mayo. He holds nine patents and has authored 15 major textbooks under four different titles, translated into six languages. He has written over 450 peer-reviewed publications.</p>



<p>Dr. Morrey is the third orthopedic surgeon from Mayo Clinic to receive this national pillar of profession recognition. The others are the late Mark Coventry, M.D., and the late Patrick Kelly, M.D.</p>



<p>More information about Dr. Morrey's recognition is available in the AOA <a href="https://www.aoassn.org/aoa-pillars-of-the-orthopaedic-profession/">news release</a>.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Don't worry about your hips or knees as you age. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350772?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arthritis</a> in those joints isn't inevitable. Keep doing the activities you enjoy. Those hopeful words come from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sierra-rafael-j-m-d/bio-20054877?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rafael Sierra, M.D.</a>, an orthopedic surgeon at Mayo Clinic specializing in hip and knee reconstruction. Dr. Sierra says there is no need to curtail your activities out of fear that you'll wear out those joints as you age and need joint replacement.</p>



<p>However, certain conditions, such as birth defects and anatomical issues, may predispose a person to have hip or knee problems. Untreated, hip dysplasia and hip impingement are leading causes of hip replacement in people under 50. Having bowlegs, knock knees — or other structural issues­ — can hasten the need for knee replacement.</p>



<p>"But it's not like the rest of us have to be worried and say, 'OK, at age 50, maybe I should have my hips or knees examined by a doctor,'" Dr. Sierra says. "In general, your body — your musculoskeletal system — will let you know when you have issues."</p>



<p>There are no preventive screenings for hips or knees, so pain is a major tip-off that trouble may be brewing. Some people don't even realize they have hip or knee issues until they experience pain doing new activities or movements.</p>



<p>Over the years, innovations in hip and knee implants and surgical techniques have made the operations even more technically precise, Dr. Sierra says. New plastics used in hip and knee replacements are extremely durable.</p>



<p>Changes in anesthesia and pain control techniques have improved the care given to patients before, during and after surgery. More people are having outpatient hip and knee replacement surgery. If you do get a knee or hip replacement, your doctor will likely recommend being conservative with your activities.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Dr. Sierra says avascular necrosis, or the death of bone tissue, remains one of the unsolved issues in hip surgery, with much research still ahead. Also, research continues into abductor tears or tears of the muscles around the hip. Women are especially prone to this condition.</p>

<p>From strikes and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscle-strains/symptoms-causes/syc-20450507?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strains</a> to footwork and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stress-fractures/symptoms-causes/syc-20354057?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fractures</a>, injuries can happen to any young athlete.</p>



<p>Reducing the risk of injury starts with an annual physical to make sure children can participate. When it's time to play, warm up muscles by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/stretching-and-flexibility/hlv-20049447?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stretching</a>, and use protective equipment, when appropriate.</p>



<p>"It's important to try out your equipment before you get into game-time situations to make sure it works properly, so that it's actually protecting you when you're going out there to perform the sport," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>Try to avoid <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/overuse-injury/art-20045875?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overusing</a> certain muscles over others. Repeated motions can happen around <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/growth-plate-fractures/symptoms-causes/syc-20351979?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growth plates</a> and may require young athletes to pause certain activities.</p>



<p>"They need time to rest because they've put too much stress on the area. And without that, they just don't heal," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>If children are injured playing a sport, keep them out of competition until they can be evaluated.</p>



<p>"The worst thing that you can do is get up and try to play through these things and make the injury worse," says Dr. Troyer.</p>

<p>Summer is winding down, and soon kids will be heading onto the field to play their favorite fall sports. But before they can check into the game, they have to head into the doctor's office for sports screenings.</p>



<p>It's generally required that young athletes get a preparticipation exam before participating in organized activities.&nbsp;The exams aren't just a formality. It's to ensure your child's safety and check to see if they are physically able to play.</p>

<p>"It's very important to identify any potential risk that they may be exposed to before their participation in the respective sport," says Dr. Anastasi.</p>



<p>A typical sports screening includes assessing vision, heart and lungs. Sports medicine specialists also will look at the joints.</p>



<p>"Really focusing on all the joints, ranging from neck, shoulders, elbows, and then moving down to lower extremity hips, knees, ankles," says Dr. Anastasi.</p>



<p>A thorough exam also includes going over medical and family history. This will help identify underlying conditions that might put a child at risk during physical activity.</p>



<p>Dr. Anastasi says sports screenings are not substitutes for health maintenance exams. He also recommends young athletes get a yearly sports physical. </p>



<p>"It's a great opportunity to really identify if something is normal or abnormal, and also to help that athlete succeed at the highest level of his or her ability," says Dr. Anastasi.</p>

You have an opportunity to connect with other people," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/soma-david-b-m-d/bio-20135572?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Dr. David Soma</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric sports medicine specialist.</p>



<p>He says there also are emotional benefits.</p>



<p>"So you learn ... that teamwork piece or that perseverance — learning how to win, learning how to lose."</p>



<p>He says a way to get your kids involved in sports is to start young by just getting them active and outdoors.</p>



<p>"We live in a society where people want to stay inside and stare at screens," says Dr. Soma. "But get outside. Go for a bike ride as a family. Go for a run. Kick the ball around the yard. Just get them moving and seeing what they like to do."</p>



<p>And don't focus on just one individual sport, especially at a younger age.</p>



<p>"There's really good evidence that you should not do that," says Dr. Soma. "It's best to have a kid in the elementary school-aged years really do multiple sports. Expose them to as many different things that they're interested in as possible."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;My 10-year-old daughter was just diagnosed with scoliosis. The curve is 19 degrees, and I have read that it could worsen with time. Will she need to wear a brace? Or is surgery indicated?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;It sounds like your daughter’s case of scoliosis is mild and may not need treatment. But you are correct that scoliosis can progress over time. If it does, your daughter may need to wear a brace to prevent the curve from worsening.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scoliosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350716?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scoliosis</a> is an abnormal sideways curvature of the spine. Most people have a spine that is relatively straight. Generally, a spine with a 10-degree curve or less is considered normal. A curve greater than 10 degrees is defined as scoliosis.</p>



<p>The goal of scoliosis treatment is to keep the curve from getting worse. Treatment options depend in large part on the curve’s severity. Curves between 10 and 25 degrees — where your daughter’s case fits — are in the mild range. The moderate range is between 25 and 50 degrees, and greater than 50 degrees is severe.</p>



<p>Other factors to consider when deciding on scoliosis treatment include a child’s gender — girls have a much higher risk than boys of the curve getting worse, as well as the location and pattern of the spinal curve.</p>



<p>For children who have early detection of scoliosis, treatment with bracing is always the first choice. Typically, braces can be prescribed to treat mild or moderate curves by holding the spine in a corrected position while the spine grows.</p>



<p>A scoliosis brace is made of plastic and contoured to conform to the body. It is a close-fitting brace and goes unnoticed under most clothing, as it fits under the arms and around the rib cage, lower back and hips.</p>



<p>Braces work by pushing on the muscles and bones attached to the spine. This holds the spine in place, preventing it from curving more and typically straightening the alignment of a curved spine.&nbsp; Physical therapy can help with pain control and improved posture.</p>



<p>Because a brace’s effectiveness increases with the number of hours it is worn, most children wear their braces day and night. But one caveat about braces: they only work to treat scoliosis in children who are still growing. For most kids, brace treatment typically is no longer an option after age 16. But once a child stops growing, it also is unlikely that a spinal curve will progress any further.</p>



<p>There are now several motion-sparing surgical treatment options for patients with moderate to severe scoliosis to help preserve spinal flexibility and growth. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vertebral body tethering.</strong><br>The spine is accessed through small incisions in the side, and a special camera is used during surgery. Metal screws are placed in the vertebrae where the spine is curved, and a plastic cord connects these screws. The cord is tensioned to shorten the long side of the scoliosis curve, acting as an internal brace. As children continue to grow, the curve may correct over time. The cord is flexible so the spine still can move, and the spine can continue to grow.&nbsp; Patients can return to all sports in six weeks.</li>



<li><strong>Posterior dynamic distraction.</strong><br>An incision is made over the back. Three screws are placed and connected with a single rod with two ball-bearing joints to allow motion and growth.</li>
</ul>



<p>Severe scoliosis almost always can benefit from surgical treatment. The most common type of scoliosis surgery is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/spinal-fusion/about/pac-20384523?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spinal fusion</a>, which involves connecting two or more of the bones in the spine together so they can’t move independently. After fusion, the spine no longer grows over the area where the spine is fused, and the spine does not move over the fused area. In most cases, the unfused spine area can compensate, and children can perform most daily activities and return to most sports in three to six months.</p>



<p>Talk to your daughter’s healthcare team about her diagnosis and the risk of the spinal curve worsening. Many children with mild curves, such as your daughter, do not need a brace or surgery. Instead, focus on correct posture and regular follow-up appointments with her healthcare professional about every six months to check for any evidence that the curve may be worsening.</p>



<p>If, at some point, her curve grows and crosses the line from mild to moderate severity at about 25 degrees, then treatment, such as a brace, may be necessary. It may be worthwhile to consult with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/orthopedic-surgery/home/orc-20126749?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pediatric orthopedic surgeon</a> to understand what may be necessary in the future.</p>



<p>Also, talk to your daughter about how she’s feeling. Coping with scoliosis can be difficult for pre-teens and teens. Support and encouragement from family and friends can help. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/larson-a-noelle-m-d/bio-20055469?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Dr. A.

<p>Jennifer Budd's biggest accomplishment is also her biggest heartbreak.</p>



<p>Jen, an MRI scanning technician at Mayo Clinic in Florida, started running in 2009 to get into shape and to reduce stress.</p>



<p>Soon, running progressed into a passion, not just for her but also for her family. By 2013, she had completed eight half-marathons. But she'd also had two knee surgeries — an ACL surgery and a meniscus repair.</p>



<p>The surgeries didn't slow her down — at least not initially. She actually was thinking bigger. &nbsp;</p>



<p>She had watched her husband complete a marathon and wanted to try it herself. In 2014, she accomplished that goal.</p>



<p>"There is something cathartic about running. The simplicity helps to clear my mind," Jen says. "I also like the commitment it takes to run a marathon — following the training schedule, putting in the time, and then meeting up with thousands of other runners and crossing the finish line together."</p>



<p>Eventually, knee pain caught up to her, however, and she couldn't continue running.</p>



<p>"My knee pain steadily increased until 2020, when I had to wave the white flag," Jen says. "My activity level was greatly reduced due to the pain in my knee, and I knew it was time."</p>



<p>That's when she met with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ortiguera-cedric-j-m-d/bio-20053864?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cedric Ortiguera, M.D</a>., an orthopedic surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reclaiming her passion for running</h3>



<p>Jen was no stranger to Mayo Clinic. She calls herself fully "Mayo-nized." She was born at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and next year will celebrate 25 years of working at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>During Jen's appointment, Dr. Ortiguera recommended that she undergo surgery to replace her patella-femoral joint, also known as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/knee-replacement/doctors-departments/pdc-20385277?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partial knee replacement</a>.</p>



<p>Jen agreed to the surgery after talking through her goals.</p>



<p>"Dr. Ortiguera is amazing. He is incredibly kind and patient. He listened to me and knew what I wanted to achieve after surgery," Jen says. "I knew that without the surgery, I would have never been able to continue being active, and my quality of life would not have been the same."</p>



<p>&nbsp;There was work to do after the surgery. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"The recovery process was humbling," Jen recalls.</p>



<p>She treated recovery like a full-time job and began physical therapy right away.</p>



<p>"I got to know my physical therapy team well. They were so knowledgeable and gave me the right tools to help me regain muscle strength," Jen says. "It was fun celebrating milestones with them —– making a complete revolution on the bike, walking up stairs, bending my knee past 90 degrees."</p>



<p>Her commitment to physical therapy paid off when Dr. Ortiguera gave her the green light to start running again. She laced up her shoes and started training for her first post-surgery race — the New York City Marathon.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Not slowing down</h3>



<p>About a year later, Jen returned to see Dr. Ortiguera for a follow-up appointment.</p>



<p>"My favorite moment was when he asked what activities I had been doing," she says. "I told him I had been using my Peloton bike, doing strength training, and I ran the New York City Marathon.</p>



<p>"He was genuinely happy for me," Jen says. "I felt like I had crossed the finish line again."</p>



<p>Since that visit, Jen has completed three more marathons, and she doesn't plan to slow down anytime soon.</p>



<p>"My goal is to run the six major world marathons — New York City, Berlin, London, Chicago, Tokyo and Boston," she says.</p>



<p>With New York City, London and Berlin crossed off her list, that leaves only three.</p>



<p>"I am running the Chicago Marathon in October and have already applied to run the Tokyo Marathon. I am still chasing the Boston Marathon qualifying time," Jen says. "Running with my husband and sons has been such an amazing experience. I have never crossed a finish line without crying tears of pride."</p>



<p>And she says she can't thank Mayo Clinic and Dr. Ortiguera enough for fixing her up and getting her back on track to pursue her passion.&nbsp;</p>
