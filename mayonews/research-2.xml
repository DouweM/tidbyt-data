<p>Most lumps or&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-understanding-thyroid-nodules/">nodules</a>&nbsp;in the thyroid, which is a gland in your neck, are not harmful and don't need treatment. But sometimes, they can grow bigger and cause problems like trouble swallowing. In those cases, doctors might need to do surgery to remove them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There's also a treatment called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/radiofrequency-ablation-therapy-for-large-benign-thyroid-nodules/mac-20439239">radiofrequency ablation</a>&nbsp;(RFA), which uses heat to make the nodules smaller.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/stan-marius-n-m-d/bio-20055065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Marius Stan</a>, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist, says this nonsurgical treatment for shrinking thyroid nodules offers patients a safe and highly successful procedure. He says Mayo Clinic also is researching how RFA may be used to treat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid cancer</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Radiofrequency ablation, which many people might simply call an RFA, is a way of targeting a specific part of the thyroid, an abnormal part, by delivering high energy into that specific area of the thyroid and destroying it," says Dr. Stan.</p>



<p>He says patients with enlarged, benign thyroid nodules are good candidates for RFA.</p>



<p>"Patients will have an inch and a half to two inches thyroid nodules in diameter that we think are reaching the point where a problem is present or is likely going to be present," Dr. Stan says.</p>

<p>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) works by works by using heat to shrink or destroy benign thyroid nodules.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Along with retaining thyroid function, there are other advantages.</p>



<p>"The benefit is that we can do it in the outpatient setting, without the scar on the neck," he says.</p>



<p>Treating thyroid nodules is one application for RFA. Mayo Clinic is one of the leading U.S. institutions to research using RFA for thyroid cancer treatment.</p>



<p>"We hope that this will also be able to destroy a thyroid cancer very specifically, as opposed to a surgical approach that would eliminate part of the thyroid," says Dr. Stan.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Artificial intelligence (AI) from patient electrocardiograms (ECGs) may be an innovative solution to enhance heart disease risk assessment. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atherosclerotic</a> cardiovascular disease — arteries narrowed or blocked by the accumulation of fatty plaques — is the leading global cause of death and is often driven by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>. New <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00436-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study data published in eClinicalMedicine</a> suggest that ECG-AI can flag some risks years sooner than current risk calculator equations by identifying signs of coronary artery disease, such as calcification and blockages, as well as evidence of a prior heart attack.</p>



<p>Many people may have coronary artery disease and not be aware of it. Unfortunately, the first sign of the disease could be sudden death or a major heart attack. Clinician tools, such as the pooled cohort equation, help determine a patient's 10-year risk for heart attacks and strokes. The tools guide shared decisions about the timing of therapies, but these tools have limitations.</p>



<p>ECG is a widely available test that measures the heart's electrical activity, and AI can be trained to identify and detect hidden patterns of disease from those electrical signals.</p>



<p>The ECG-AI to predict coronary artery disease was developed at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> and <a href="https://anumana.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anumana</a> using the retrospective analysis of electronic health data of over 7 million patients across the U.S. Three separate ECG-AI models were trained, one each to detect coronary artery calcium, coronary artery blockage and segments of the heart's left ventricle not moving well — a sign of a prior heart attack.</p>



<p>"Used together, the three independent ECG-AI models predicted which patients had a high risk of hidden coronary artery disease, and therefore a high risk of having a heart attack. This is important information to guide our conversations with patients at the point of care, especially since the AI was useful in calculating these risks for as short as three years," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the paper. "Used alone, the pooled cohort equation estimates the 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The addition of ECG-AI to see hidden risks sooner has the potential to save more lives. This model may also help identify people who do not know they have coronary disease who may benefit from lifesaving therapies."</p>



<p>The study was funded by Anumana, a spinoff company of nference and Mayo Clinic. Mayo Clinic has licensed this technology to Anumana. Mayo Clinic and authors of this study may benefit financially in the future if this technology is commercialized.</p>

<p>A recent Mayo Clinic<a>&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.122.028734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;of residents living in a mostly rural, 11‐county region of southeast Minnesota found that patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a> and multiple social risk factors were more likely than other heart failure patients to experience adverse outcomes such as emergency department visits, hospitalization, delayed recovery and reduced quality of life.</p>



<p>Researchers investigated the effect of social factors, including education, isolation and "community deprivation" — a lack of community resources and opportunities measured at the community level.</p>

<p>"The findings suggest that it is possible to identify a small but meaningful subset of patients with heart failure who have multiple, co-occurring social risk factors and may be at greater risk for poor health outcomes," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/savitz-samuel-sam-t-ph-d/bio-20503199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Savitz, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic health services researcher and lead author of the study.</p>



<p>Researchers used a statistical method to categorize 3,142 patients with heart failure. They all were living in an 11‐county region of southeast Minnesota and were 18 years or older with a first‐ever diagnosis of heart failure. The average age was 73.4, with 45.2% of the patients being women.</p>



<p>Researchers divided them into four groups based on living environments and other social risk factors.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Group 1</strong>&nbsp;had 1,093 patients living in urban areas with moderate social risk factors.</li>



<li><strong>Group 2</strong>&nbsp;had 531 patients living in rural areas with similar risk factors.</li>



<li><strong>Group 3</strong>&nbsp;had 185 patients and was considered moderately rural with multiple social risk factors.</li>



<li><strong>Group 4</strong>, the reference group, had 1,333 patients and consisted of mostly urban areas with higher education levels and fewer social risk challenges.&nbsp;</li>

<p>According to the study, patients in Group 3 — living in a moderately rural area and facing the most social risk factors — used more healthcare services than those in Group 4, who had higher education levels and more access to community resources.</p>



<p>Patients in Group 1 — living in urban areas — had better outcomes than those in the "mostly urban" Group 4, despite having more social risk factors. The researchers suggest this was likely due to better access to care within their urban community.</p>



<p>The research also revealed that approximately 18.2% of patients within the study experienced moderate social isolation, while 5.7% experienced high social isolation, indicating a lack of social connections or support.</p>



<p>"This study provides further evidence that health systems and policymakers should devote resources and develop interventions to address the effects of social risk factors on patient outcomes," says&nbsp;Dr. Savitz.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking a Patient-Centered Approach</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Savitz said the study also shows that heart failure cannot be treated in isolation but should be viewed through a broader lens of the patient’s life circumstances. Future interventions, he says, could use a patient-centered approach to address social risk factors.</p>



<p>He notes that it is crucial to evaluate whether these findings extend to other regions of the country, particularly those with greater racial and ethnic diversity.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a distinctive pattern in a specific set of 17 genes that may be associated with remission after treatment for&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/in-depth/breast-cancer/art-20045654" target="_blank">triple-negative breast cancer</a>. The multi-omics study,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-023-01656-x" target="_blank">published in Breast Cancer Research</a>, highlights the potential for further investigating this signature as a target for individualized medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately 10-15% of breast cancers fall into the category of "triple-negative," indicating that their growth is not driven through the hormone receptors for estrogen or progesterone, nor by the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In contrast, other breast cancers have at least one of these receptors, allowing for treatments that can target or block them to inhibit the cancer's progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Triple-negative breast cancer is known for its resistance to targeted therapies, leaving chemotherapy as the primary treatment option. While most patients initially respond well to the standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, nearly 20% of patients will experience recurrence after treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's crucial that we create tools that assist clinicians in making informed treatment decisions," says&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kalari-krishna-r-ph-d/bio-00095546" target="_blank">Krishna Rani Kalari, Ph.D.</a>, a lead author of the study and an associate professor of biomedical informatics at the Center for Individualized Medicine. "This 17-gene signature is one of the candidate tools that shows potential. However, for this signature to have clinical utility, there will need to be studies evaluating whether alternative drugs/drug combinations may work in this group of patients."&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Decoding pattern in 17 genes</h3>



<p>In their study, the researchers investigated tumor samples before and after treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer who failed to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Using multi-omics analysis and machine learning technologies, they examined changes in gene expression to understand the molecular underpinnings driving tumor recurrence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multi-omics is an emerging multidisciplinary field of biological sciences that encompasses genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and more.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team identified 17 genes associated with relapse-free survival and found that many of the genes may play a role in triggering inflammation to initiate an immune system response. Dr. Kalari says failure to initiate immune response prevents the clearance of weakened tumor cells, thereby permitting the development of treatment resistance and disease re-occurrence.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quest for individualized medicine</h3>



<p>The study is an extension of Mayo Clinic's clinical prospective breast cancer study known as Breast Cancer Genome-Guided Therapy Study (<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/research/clinical-studies/beauty2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BEAUTY</a>). The goal of the study is to determine why some patient’s tumors respond to chemotherapy while others don't, and to use that knowledge as a catalyst to develop personalized medicine therapies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the team plans to further investigate the gene signature and test therapeutic strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-lead authors of the study are Mayo Clinic researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kalari-krishna-r-ph-d/bio-00095546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krishna Rani Kalari, Ph.D.</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/boughey-judy-c-m-d/bio-00027350">Judy Boughey, M.D</a>., and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-00027285">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>&nbsp;Additional authors include Xiaojia Tang, Ph.D. and Kevin Thompson, Ph.D. A comprehensive list of the authors, disclosures, and funding are available in the <a href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-023-01656-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forty-eight international experts on <a href="https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(23)00490-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">membranous nephropathy</a> have co-authored a <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00372-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consensus report</a> that calls for a new method of classifying diagnoses of the syndrome. They say the change would result in greater accuracy in diagnoses, which would open the door to improved patient care and targeted treatment. To call attention to the report, <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a> and <a href="https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(23)00490-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidney International</a> have published the report simultaneously.</p>



<p>Membranous nephropathy is a kidney disorder that involves immunologic attack on structures inside the kidney that help filter wastes and fluids, and it's a relatively common cause of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nephrotic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20375608">nephrotic syndrome</a> in adults. Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disorder that causes the body to leak relatively large amounts of protein into the urine. It causes swelling, particularly in the feet and ankles, and increases the risk of other health problems.</p>



<p>With current diagnostic processes, in approximately 70% of cases involving membranous nephropathy, it's classified as the primary cause of disease. In the remaining cases, it's classified as secondary to another recognized disease or cause. "Recent discoveries have rendered the primary-secondary classification of membranous nephropathy anachronistic," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/nath-karl-a-m-d/bio-00027413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Karl Nath, M.B., Ch.B</a>, a co-author of the report and editor-in-chief of Mayo Clinic Proceedings. "In its place, the Mayo Clinic Consensus Report on Membranous Nephropathy proposes a new two-step classification that incorporates recent discoveries, is clinically based and pragmatic."</p>



<p>The consensus report is the result of a Mayo Clinic-sponsored meeting in Rochester, Minnesota, on Oct. 29, 2022, and was made possible by discoveries at Mayo Clinic. The article in Mayo Clinic Proceedings and Kidney International<em>, </em>the journal of the <a href="https://www.theisn.org/">International Society of Nephrology</a>, outlines a diagnostic classification process that incorporates recent discoveries and emerging research. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fervenza-fernando-fernando-c-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027412">Fernando Fervenza, M.D., Ph.D.,</a> director of Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/mayo-nephrology-collaborative-group/about">Nephrology Collaborative Group</a>, is senior author.

<p>In <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00403-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a commentary</a> that accompanies the consensus statement in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, Dr. Nath and co-authors <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/erickson-lori-a-m-d/bio-00084505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lori A.

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a new high-resolution, analytical technique to identify the rare senescent bone cells that are known to drive <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">osteoporosis</a>. Senescent cells are malfunctioning cells that build up as people age or as the result of chronic diseases. Once these cells form, they can contribute to developing diseases and consequences of aging. This new method, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37524694/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed in a paper published in Nature Communications</a>, will enable scientists to better target experimental anti-aging drugs at the cellular level, advancing efforts to find treatments for osteoporosis and other aging-related diseases.</p>



<p></p>

<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Doolittle-Madison-L._21598983_202001200201-250x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-375685" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Madison Doolittle, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p class="has-text-align-left">"Senescent cells are notoriously challenging to identify. With this work, we are overcoming a barrier that has hindered past research," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/osteoporosis-and-bone-biology/faculty-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madison Doolittle, Ph.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic endocrinology researcher and first author of the paper. "We expect this technique will enhance our ability to study these cells in a precise manner, understand the mechanisms of diseases and develop more focused targets for treatment."</p>



<p>This research will inform clinical trials at Mayo Clinic and around the world that are testing experimental treatments for osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s disease, chronic kidney disease and other aging-related diseases. The new technique is already being used to map senescent cells through the National Institutes of Health's&nbsp;<a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/senescence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cellular Senescence Network</a>.</p>



<p>The new technique involves mass cytometry, a method scientists employ to analyze the differences among many types of cells and to identify specific cells by the types of proteins displayed on their surfaces or interiors. To pinpoint senescent cells, the researchers looked for the presence of p16, p21, BCL-2, and CD24 proteins, which control the development and survival of senescent cells.</p>

<p></p>



<p>"The novel, single-cell approach that Dr. Doolittle developed opens up new ways to identify these rare senescent cells not only in bone but also broadly across tissues," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/khosla-sundeep-m-d/bio-00078126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sundeep Khosla, M.D.,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist and senior author of the paper. "From a translational and clinical perspective, this would help in potentially quantifying the burden of senescent cells in patients and their response to interventions that kill or disable these harmful cells."</p>



<p>Dr. Khosla anticipates that future research will focus on applying this technique to identify strategies to improve bone healing and regeneration after skeletal injury.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ultrasound/about/pac-20395177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrasound</a>&nbsp;— a technology that uses sound waves to produce an image — is commonly used to monitor the development of a baby as it grows inside its mother. But ultrasound imaging also can be used to investigate suspicious masses of tissue and nodules that may be cancerous.</p>



<p>Tumors consist not only of cancer cells but also a matrix of small blood vessels, or microvessels, that cannot be seen in the images produced by conventional ultrasound machines. To solve this problem, physician-scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/alizad-azra-m-d/bio-00085586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azra Alizad, M.D.</a>, and biomedical engineering scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fatemi-mostafa-ph-d/bio-00086282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostafa Fatemi, Ph.D.</a>, teamed up at Mayo Clinic to design and study a tool that may improve the resolution of ultrasound imaging. As demonstrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, they developed high-resolution ultrasound imaging software, compatible with many ultrasound machines, that could exponentially improve both the detail and quality of images.</p>



<p>The investigational software, which they've named quantitative high-definition microvessel imaging (q-HDMI), has been evaluated to capture high-resolution 2D and 3D images of microvessels as small as 150 microns, roughly twice the width of a human hair.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 35%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>"If we can visualize and capture the microvessel in the earliest stages of cancer, we can better diagnose and treat it earlier, which improves the outcome for the patient," says Dr. Alizad, who specializes in ultrasound technology for cancer imaging.</p>

<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artificial intelligence helps detect what we cannot see</strong></h2>



<p>In addition, the researchers identified a series of biomarkers representing specific characteristics of tiny </p>



<p>vessels, such as shape, pattern, irregularity and complexity, and packaged them into an algorithm that can sort the image data into benign or malignant masses.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:37% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="481" height="532" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-375670 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical.jpg 481w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical-271x300.jpg 271w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">

<p>"This technology provides a quantitative value that shows the probability of malignancy," Dr. Fatemi says. "It's a tool to extract information in a way that can be useful to clinicians."</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applying it in practice</strong></h2>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-022-01583-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical study</a>, the researchers showed that their new q-HDMI tool combined with artificial intelligence (AI) was able to detect a very small, 3-millimeter-wide, malignant breast cancer mass comprised of miniscule vessels in a 40-year-old woman. Finding and treating cancer lesions when they are this size before they spread, or metastasize, can be lifesaving.</p>



<p>"The questions in radiology really are: benign or malignant? And if it's suspicious, how concerned should we be?" Dr. Fatemi says.</p>



<p>To help radiologists answer these questions, the researchers applied their software and algorithm to further analyze suspicious breast masses from 521 patients who already had received conventional ultrasound imaging. The results were astounding. The new technology yielded a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 100% rate of accuracy</a>&nbsp;in determining malignant versus benign masses, regardless of the tumor size.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>More recently, the researchers analyzed thyroid nodules from 92 patients. Thyroid nodules are common and it is often hard to differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous ones through imaging. Yet the prevalence of thyroid cancer has increased over the last few decades.</p>



<p>"With conventional ultrasound images, physicians can diagnose whether a thyroid nodule is benign or malignant with only about 35-75% accuracy," Dr. Alizad says. That's why physicians often opt to perform thyroid biopsies, which enable them to more definitively determine if a thyroid nodule is a cause for concern.</p>



<p>The researchers identified 12 biomarkers that can differentiate benign from malignant thyroid tissues. They programmed the AI-powered algorithm with these biomarkers, which sorted the images and had an 84% rate of accuracy. These results were published in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36980774/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancers</a>&nbsp;and highlighted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/news-events/newsroom/how-combination-advanced-ultrasound-and-ai-could-upgrade-cancer-diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>



<p>"If it is cancer, we definitely want to know that. But if we can determine if a thyroid nodule is benign without even having to do a biopsy, that is even better as it spares the patient from the financial and physical burdens associated with an unnecessary benign biopsy," Dr. Alizad says.</p>



<p>The researchers see that their quantitative tool could be particularly useful in parts of the world where there is limited expertise and resources, such as rural areas and developing countries.</p>



<p>They also are collaborating with oncologists to enable them to use the q-HDMI tool to better monitor the effectiveness of cancer treatments and help them adjust therapies for individual patients in real time.</p>

<p>In a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajh.27086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers examined telomere biology disorders, a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by short telomeres. Telomeres are long segments at the end of chromosomes that protect the DNA from unraveling, similar to the small plastic sheath at the end of a shoelace. Telomeres shorten naturally with age but become abnormally shorter in telomere biology disorders. People with these disorders often have bone marrow failure and, for unknown reasons, a high risk of developing blood cancer.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers explored the causes of this increased cancer risk by assessing clonal hematopoiesis in patients with telomere biology disorders. Clonal hematopoiesis is also an age-related event that occurs when blood stem cells acquire genetic mutations that make them divide more rapidly than normal. This creates a growing clone in the blood that can evolve into blood cancer. Approximately 10-20% of the population over 70 present an observable clonal hematopoiesis. However, how these clones evolve over time depends on the gene mutation acquired and the surrounding environment of the cells.</p>



<p>The study found that people with telomere biology disorders often have a high percentage of clonal hematopoiesis. Variants in the&nbsp;<em>U2AF1</em>&nbsp;gene are especially common. In contrast, clonal hematopoiesis that occurs because of aging is associated with other mutated genes. This difference suggests that the&nbsp;<em>U2AF1</em>&nbsp;gene may play a role in developing blood cancer, specifically in people with telomere biology disorders.</p>

<p>"<em>U2AF1</em>&nbsp;mutations can affect the expression of specific genes and contribute to the emergence of clonal hematopoiesis in a way that is unique to these patients," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ferrer-alejandro-ph-d/bio-20503546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic hematology researcher.

<p></p>



<p>The findings are especially relevant for people with telomere biology disorders who may be sensitive to standard cancer therapies due to a combination of factors, including preexisting genomic instability, shortened telomeres and the potential effect of these therapies on cancer and healthy cells.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future Research</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers need to better understand why the&nbsp;<em>U2AF1&nbsp;</em>gene is prominently mutated in people with telomere biology disorders compared to other genes.

<p>Mayo Clinic research has developed a new type of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</a> aimed at killing B-cell blood cancers that have returned and are no longer responding to treatment.

<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."</p>



<p>Dr Qin's team developed a cell therapy to target a protein known as B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) found in patients with B-cell cancers, particularly those with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a>. The BAFF-R protein is linked to tumor growth. The cell therapy under investigation allows the immune system to quash cancer and target tumors that have returned or have resisted available CAR-T cell therapies.</p>



<p>"Our team developed a method to isolate T cells and tumor cells from blood samples of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We generated BAFF-R targeting CAR-T cells from the individual samples and then demonstrated in the lab that these genetically modified cells could kill tumors using the patients' own cells," says Dr. Qin.</p>



<p>The results of this early research lay the foundation for an important milestone: Mayo Clinic will biomanufacture this experimental CAR-T cell therapy at its campus in Florida. The research team will advance the CAR-T cells to a phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and define the treatment dose in humans.</p>



<p>Depending on the results of the phase 1 clinical trial, it could take 5-7 years for this therapy to become available to patients in the clinic.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic in Florida <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hematology-oncology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, supports delivering new cell therapies to patients with complex medical conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transforming cancer care</strong></h2>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy is a regenerative immunotherapy that seeks to unlock the power of the body's immune system to attack cancer. Patients' T-cells are separated from their blood, genetically modified, mass produced and then returned to their bodies to kill cancer.</p>



<p>The experimental therapies have delivered transformative results — &nbsp;in some cases putting B-cell lymphomas and leukemias into remission. However, leukemia and lymphoma tumors can change over time and become resistant to therapies, resulting in a return or relapse of cancer. 40% of patients have had cancer return within two years of undergoing CAR-T cell therapy. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing on-site</strong></h2>



<p>This BAFF-R targeting technology is the first CAR-T cell therapy to both be developed at Mayo Clinic and biomanufactured on-site. The advantages to biomanufacturing in-house are the ability to adjust doses, individualize treatments and more quickly deliver the cells back to the patient.</p>

<p>"The cornerstone of Mayo's biomanufacturing strategy is accelerating promising new medicines from human sources such as cells to patient care. Biomanufacturing CAR-T cells is a high priority because of the potential to provide healing for patients with few or no other solutions," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, The Michael S. and Mary Sue Shannon Director of the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "We are very excited to reach this landmark of biomanufacturing the first CAR-T cell therapy developed by Mayo Clinic research." Dr. Allickson is also the Otto Bremer Trust Director, Biomanufacturing and Product Development, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is expanding its biomanufacturing facilities on all three campuses to quickly move cell therapies from the lab to early-stage clinical trials. From there, Mayo hopes to collaborate with industry to bring new regenerative immunotherapies to routine clinical care for the benefit of patients around the world.</p>
