<p><em><strong>Editors note:</strong> September is National Suicide Prevention Month</em></p>



<p>In 2021, suicide was the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S., claiming the lives of more than 48,000 people — nearly double the number of homicides. People of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds choose to end their own lives. That means that people of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds may be affected by suicide.</p>



<p>When learning that a loved one, friend, neighbor, work colleague or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/do-children-grieve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">child</a> has lost someone to suicide, you want to support them. Your first thought might be, "What do I say?"</p>



<p>Supporting someone <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/offering-support-to-the-grieving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grieving</a> a suicide loss can be uncomfortable and even a bit scary. The support you provide is crucial to helping them navigate this tragedy, and it's essential to their mental health. Be aware that those who have lost someone to suicide are at a higher risk of dying from suicide, as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to start the conversation about suicide</h2>



<p>People who have lost a loved one to suicide may consider themselves a survivor. They may be experiencing a complex range of feelings from grief to anger, shame and fear. Being present and showing you care — without judgment — plays a vital role in supporting them.</p>



<p>When talking with the survivor, show you still remember their loved one. Use the person's name, share memories and maybe even photos of time spent together. Talking openly about the person can help remove the stigma of their death. Sometimes, all you need to do is listen.</p>



<p>The survivor may ask unanswerable questions, such as, "I don’t understand how this happened," or "How could they do this to me?" Validate those thoughts and acknowledge that neither of you has the answers. Provide support with statements such as, "This is very hard for you, and I'm sorry that I don't have any answers."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Maintaining connection after loss</h2>



<p>Often, a survivor hears most from their circles of family and friends shortly after the death, but then the connections taper off. The survivor's emotions and feelings haven't tapered off. That's why keeping in touch is so important.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/grief-and-loss-throughout-the-holiday-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holidays</a>, anniversaries, birthdays and other milestone events can be particularly difficult for survivors because they conjure up intense memories and emotions about their loved ones. Check in with survivors around these times. A "thinking of you" card, email or text may be all they need to know you're there for them. They may also ask for space, and that's OK too.</p>



<p>Also, remember to include the survivor in activities. If you've frequently met for coffee, extend the invitation again. If they enjoy the theater, ask if they'd like to go to a show with you. If the answer is "no," accept it and don't push, but don't give up on them. The time will come when they say, "Yes."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be aware of suicide warning signs</h2>



<p>Because survivors are at greater risk of dying from suicide, pay attention to them. Listen to what they're saying and what they're not saying.&nbsp; And although it's uncomfortable for you — without judging them or minimizing their feelings — gently ask if they're having thoughts of suicide themselves.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some questions to consider:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you feel you have no hope for the future?</li>



<li>Do you feel you'd be better off dead?</li>



<li>Do you feel your loved ones would be better off without you?</li>



<li>Do you think you might try to hurt yourself today?</li>



<li>Have you had thoughts of suicide?</li>



<li>Have you been thinking of killing yourself?</li>



<li>Have you thought of ways you might hurt yourself?</li>



<li>What would you do to end your life?</li>
</ul>



<p>Setting aside your discomfort to ask a few questions can help the survivor feel supported and less alone, isolated and hopeless.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">If you're concerned for the survivor, here are some warning signs to watch for:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Acting anxious, agitated or behaving recklessly</li>



<li>Experiencing extreme mood swings</li>



<li>Increasing use of alcohol or drugs</li>



<li>Looking for a way to kill themselves like searching online or buying a gun</li>



<li>Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge</li>



<li>Sleeping too little or too much</li>



<li>Talking about being a burden to others</li>



<li>Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live</li>



<li>Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain</li>



<li>Talking about wanting to die or to kill themselves</li>



<li>Withdrawing or isolating themselves</li>
</ul>



<p>If you see these signs and are with the survivor, call 988, the national suicide and crisis line, a local crisis center or take them to the nearest emergency department.</p>



<p>Everyone plays a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/awareness-and-intervention-help-with-suicide-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">role in suicide prevention</a>. Stay connected with a survivor, listen to them, be aware of risks and warning signs, and don't hesitate to offer help when needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resources</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Note these crisis phone resources:</h3>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a> and was just diagnosed as having <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic kidney disease</a>. I am disheartened by this news, but I also am determined to do more to improve my health. I know I may not be able to reverse my condition, but I am hoping to avoid <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hemodialysis/about/pac-20384824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialysis</a> or a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777#:~:text=As%20a%20three%2Dsite%20institution,transplant%20before%20dialysis%20is%20needed." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> for as long as possible.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Your determination will help you manage your chronic kidney disease by following recommended treatments and making lifestyle changes.</p>



<p>As you know, kidneys remove waste and fluids from the body through urination. With chronic kidney disease, kidney function is gradually lost. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/end-stage-renal-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354532#:~:text=End%2Dstage%20renal%20disease%2C%20also,to%20meet%20your%20body's%20needs." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">End-stage renal failure</a> is when dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to stay alive.</p>



<p>Similar to how high blood pressure is called a silent killer, many people don't know they have chronic kidney disease until it is discovered during a lab test for another reason. Because kidney disease usually doesn't cause symptoms in earlier stages, it often is not discovered until later in the course of the disease process. In fact, one in nine people may not know they have chronic kidney disease, but it affects about 14% of the population. That's more than 30 million people in the U.S.</p>



<p>Your healthcare professional will discuss what's best to help slow progression of kidney disease in your situation, but some recommendations typically include:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Follow a kidney diet</strong></h2>



<p>One key dietary adjustment to prevent the development or progression of chronic kidney disease is <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-can-extra-salt-hurt-your-kidneys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sodium restriction</a>. Some people cook with a lot of salt and often add more salt at the table. Many processed foods also have added salt.</p>



<p>Reduce sodium intake by limiting convenience foods, salty snacks and processed meats and cheeses. Overall, try to eat fresher foods rather than foods that come out of a can or a bag. You can still <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/recipes/kidney-renal-diet-recipes/rcs-20522796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enjoy many foods</a>.</p>



<p>Increase fluid intake as well. Lack of fluid can lead to disease progression and affect how well medications work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Address underlying conditions</strong></h2>



<p>Treatments for chronic kidney disease usually involve tackling the underlying issue. One of the most common causes of chronic kidney disease is high blood pressure, also known as hypertension.</p>



<p>High blood pressure relates to the pressure inside of blood vessels when the heart is pumping and when it relaxes. That pressure can increase as we age. A number of medical problems are associated with increases in blood pressure over time, which can lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a> and chronic kidney disease. Controlling those disease processes is extremely important.</p>



<p>High blood pressure responds to our lifestyle choices, including getting regular exercise, avoiding processed foods, reducing sodium intake and eating more fruits and vegetables. All of these things reduce high blood pressure without medications.</p>



<p>Sometimes those lifestyle changes aren't enough. These are the patients who need medications to help with blood pressure control. The patient with chronic kidney disease typically has a goal blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg.</p>



<p>Some risk factors for kidney disease we can't control, such as our age and race. Being Black, Native American or Asian American, for example, increases the risk of kidney disease. But some risk factors can be controlled. Managing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking/in-depth/nicotine-craving/art-20045454" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quitting smoking or tobacco use</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintaining a healthy weight</a> are important steps to help control kidney disease. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-ivan-e-ii-m-d/bio-20113830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Ivan Porter II, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:10) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/06/MCM-Pregnancy-and-listeria-SCRIPT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Planning a picnic is no walk in the park for those who are pregnant. That's because many foods associated with summertime carry an increased risk of listeria.</p>



<p>"Listeria is a type of bacteria that is usually transmitted through food and food products. It is especially a concern if you're pregnant, if you're elderly or if you have a weakened immune system for some reason," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>



<p>Listeria is a concern for pregnant people because of the risk of transmitting the infection on to the unborn baby.</p>



<p>"It can have really severe outcomes for babies, including risks of stillbirth or death," she says.</p>



<p>Deli meats, hot dogs and soft serve ice cream are foods typically associated with listeria. However, even foods that might be considered healthy for expecting mothers can carry a listeria risk.</p>



<p>"I looked back at the last few years of listeria outbreaks, and some of the more recent ones were related to bagged salads or packaged salads," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>



<p>With such a wide variety of different foods that can become contaminated with listeria, how can you keep yourself and your baby safe?</p>



<p>When it comes to deli meats and hot dogs, make sure they are cooked to 165 degrees F. Fruits and vegetables should be washed well. And keep an eye out for reported outbreaks linked to certain foods.</p>



<p>The symptoms of listeria can be things like fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain. It can cause a flu-like illness in pregnant women, so aches and pains, joint aches and pains, and fatigue, as well.</p>



<p>If you suspect that you could have a foodborne illness, contact your healthcare professional right away.</p>

<p>As a summer surge of COVID-19 outbreaks is underway, new vaccines for the virus have been released.</p>

<p>New COVID-19 variants can evade immunity from earlier vaccination or prior infection, meaning vaccinated or previously infected people may still catch the virus. However, their immunity helps protect them from severe illness.  </p>



<p>"The recent vaccines have been designed against a variant that we saw early in 2024. The immune response that's generated by these new vaccines is much more specific to the strains that are currently in circulation," says Dr. Binnicker.&nbsp;"Studies have shown that the immune response is much more pronounced and specific against these variants and helps keep some from getting COVID-19 and, most importantly, keep them from developing severe disease."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who should get the updated COVID-19 vaccines?</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s-t0627-vaccine-recommendations.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>&nbsp;recommends that everyone 6 months and older get the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine for better protection this fall and winter. Whether you’ve previously had a COVID-19 vaccine or not, it’s important to stay protected, says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>It's recommended that everyone should get the updated COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is available. Those who recently had an infection should wait three months, or those who had a dose of the older COVID-19 vaccine should wait two months. It is especially important for those who are at higher risk of severe infection.</p>



<p>"Those who are immune compromised, those who are over the age of 75, those with certain preexisting health conditions and those who are pregnant fall into a higher risk category should get the updated COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible," explains Dr. Binnicker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaccine protection can wane over time, so staying updated with your COVID-19 vaccination is key to preventing severe illness, hospitalization and possibly death.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My friend was just diagnosed with Graves' disease, but I don’t know much about it. I want to be supportive and educate myself. What is Graves' disease, and how does it affect the body? How is it treated?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Graves' disease</a> is a condition of the immune system that leads to an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperthyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20373659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overactive thyroid</a>. It is caused by antibodies attacking the thyroid by mistake. The thyroid and the hormones it produces are the gas pedal for the body. When someone produces too much thyroid hormones, the body goes into overdrive. Your pulse increases, you overheat, you lose sleep — these symptoms make people feel so unwell that they seek medical attention. This is what leads to additional testing and the diagnosis of Graves' disease.</p>



<p>In overdrive, muscle strength is lost, and the heart beats faster, adding extra wear and tear. Much like a car running at a high RPM (revolutions per minute) for an extensive period of time, that's not good for the engine. The goal is to treat this overactive phase when treating Graves' disease.</p>



<p>The main complication of Graves' disease is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/thyroid-eye-disease-clinic-the-mayo-clinic-model/mac-20431277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid eye disease</a>. Inflammation and bulging of the eyes occur in a third of people diagnosed with Graves' disease. Managing thyroid eye disease requires an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/endocrinology/sections/overview/ovc-20392506#:~:text=Mayo%20Clinic's%20top%2Dranked%20team,of%20endocrine%20disorders%20and%20dysfunctions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endocrinologist</a> to address the thyroid and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ophthalmology/home/orc-20519115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ophthalmologists</a> who deal with eye changes. Ear, nose and throat (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20424084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ENT</a>) specialists are occasionally involved in surgeries related to the eye disease as well.</p>



<p>All these specialists operate together in a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/thyroid-eye-disease-clinic/overview/ovc-20503926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thyroid Eye Disease Clinic</a> at Mayo Clinic. The morning is dedicated to the patient moving between the different specialties and performing a set of specific tests. At noon, the specialists meet to discuss patient impressions, review the test results and create a care plan. The patient is seen again in the early afternoon, and the care plan is discussed. This includes suggestions on medication or surgery and clinical trials suited for that patient, dwelling in detail on the route the patient is interested in and contrasting it with the other choices. The benefit of this system is that a patient can get all this analysis done in one day, resulting in increased patient satisfaction. Also, the number of clinical trials is increasing, with more available choices forecasted for patients in the near future.</p>



<p>Research and innovation surrounding Graves' disease is another area of focus for the future. The ability to create molecules that hit a specific target has increased tremendously over the last few years. This is particularly effective when we know the mechanism of a disease and what the target should be. With thyroid eye disease, the main complication of Graves' disease, we know the receptor we aim to block. There have been a number of clinical trials&nbsp;that&nbsp;we are a part of that aim to block that receptor,&nbsp;improve the eye disease and,&nbsp;for some of these drugs, also treat the Graves' disease&nbsp;at the same time.</p>



<p>Targeting some of these areas has resulted in noticeable improvement in eye disease in the past several years. Furthermore, we are seeing that there are molecules in development that, in the next few years, will likely show ability to prevent the eye disease or reverse some of these changes that have already occurred. They'll do this by lowering, if not eliminating, the antibodies that are causing the problem in the first place. I am quite optimistic looking at some of the early results of our trials that there will be major benefits for patients in the coming years. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/stan-marius-n-m-d/bio-20055065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Marius Stan, M.D</strong></a><strong><em>., Endocrinology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I've just started going through menopause. The hot flashes and night sweats are so uncomfortable and keep me up at night. I've heard about hormone therapy — could that be an option for me? Are there any risks?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Navigating <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a> and its symptoms can be exhausting. To give you more information about hormone therapy, we must start with menopause. Menopause marks the end of your menstrual cycle and is diagnosed after 12 months without a menstrual period. The average age at which menopause begins in the U.S. is 51, but it can begin in your 40s. In the months or years leading up to menopause, women may experience:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hot-flashes/symptoms-causes/syc-20352790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hot flashes</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/night-sweats/basics/definition/sym-20050768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Night sweats</a></li>



<li>Trouble sleeping</li>



<li>Chills</li>



<li>Irritability or mood changes</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/menopause-weight-gain/art-20046058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weight gain</a></li>



<li>Irregular periods</li>



<li><a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/women-health/androgenic-alopecia-hair-loss-isnt-only-for-men/#:~:text=Known%20as%20androgenic%20alopecia%2C%20the,thinner%2C%20shorter%20and%20less%20dense." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hair thinning</a></li>



<li>Dry skin</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hormone therapy</a> can help manage a lot of these symptoms. Hormone therapy is medication containing hormones that your body stops producing during menopause. Hormone therapy is a safe option for the average healthy woman. Keep in mind, though, it is not for everybody.</p>



<p>There are many different options available for treatment. In general, transdermal therapies (therapies applied directly to the skin) are considered among the safest ways to administer hormone therapy. For example, there are patches that can be worn on the lower abdomen or buttock, gels can be applied to the inner thigh and sprays which go on the forearm. There are also oral routes you can take. Because of all the options we have nowadays, we usually are able to find an option that meets the average woman's specific needs.</p>



<p>After starting hormone therapy, many women experience complete or near complete resolution of hot flashes. If not, we aim to reduce them significantly enough to improve quality of life and help women regain a sense of normalcy. Hormone therapy may help many of the other symptoms women experience related to menopause such as mood changes, trouble sleeping, brain fog, skin changes and hair loss, to name a few. While these are common symptoms associated with menopause, we do not want to miss any more serious or underlying issues. So, it is best to talk to your doctor and ensure that any other potential contributing factors or underlying medical conditions are addressed. Hormone therapy has also been proven to prevent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone loss</a> and reduce fractures in women post-menopause.</p>



<p>If hormone therapy is not the right fit for you, there are several non-hormonal therapies that can be considered. Cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnosis have also been shown to ease menopausal symptoms.</p>



<p>It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle while undergoing hormone therapy. This includes staying <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/womens-wellness-fitness-tips-for-menopause/">physically active</a>, not smoking, managing stress, eating a nutritious diet and maintaining a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-combating-weight-gain-during-menopause/">healthy weight</a>. It is also important to keep up with all routine health screenings like mammograms, colonoscopies, bone density studies and routine physicals.</p>



<p>There are a lot of questions about the safety of hormone therapy — "Does it cause <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>? Will it increase my risk for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013">dementia</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>?" For the average healthy woman who is close to the menopause transition and younger than the age of 60, hormone therapy is typically a very safe option. Many of the risks associated with hormone therapy can be lessened by starting hormone therapy at the right time (within 10 years of menopause and before age 60), using transdermal therapy and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Talk to your healthcare team or a women’s health specialist i<em>f you are considering hormone therapy and aren’t sure if it’s right for you. — </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/smith-taryn-l-m-d/bio-20503248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Taryn Smith, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Women's Health, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.aap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommends infants be exclusively&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/breastfeeding-101-tips-for-new-moms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breastfed or given only breast milk</a>&nbsp;only for the first six months of life. The group also recommends that continuing breastfeeding as solid foods are introduced, up to and beyond the child's first year or as long as the mother and child desire. Many people desire to exclusively breastfeed their child for six months and plan to continue to breastfeed for one year or more.</p>



<p>Breast pain is the most frequently stated reason for early weaning. The longer a person experiences breast pain, the more likely they will wean the baby before they intend to. Immediate intervention and treatment of breast pain is crucial to preserving the breastfeeding relationship, and helping the person and their child continue breastfeeding.</p>



<p>Plugged ducts and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mastitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374829" target="_blank">mastitis</a>&nbsp;are common conditions that can affect up to 1 in 5 people who begin breastfeeding. Both conditions cause pain and discomfort in the breast, which can affect long-term breast milk feeding goals. A plugged duct obstructs milk flow in a portion of the breast, either at the nipple or further back in the ductal system. Mastitis is inflammation and infection of the breast. These conditions happen most often in the first six to eight weeks postpartum, but they can occur at any time during breastfeeding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risk factors for plugged ducts, mastitis</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/too-embarrassed-to-ask-i-just-had-a-baby-whats-wrong-with-my-moods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stress</a>, fatigue, anemia and a weakened immune system are risk factors for plugged ducts and mastitis.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Additional risk factors for plugged ducts include:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Inadequate breast emptying</strong><br>This could be caused by a poor latch or nipple pain, or a baby who is sleepy, tongue-tied or uncoordinated with suck and swallow.</li>



<li><strong>Limited time during feedings</strong><br>This could occur if feedings are rushed or if the person is breastfeeding multiple babies.</li>



<li><strong>Missed feedings</strong><br>Plugged ducts are possible when there is a longer interval between breast emptying when the baby starts sleeping for longer periods, an abrupt weaning or overuse of a pacifier.</li>



<li><strong>Pressure on the breast</strong><br>This could include pressure from fingers during feedings, tight clothing around or on the breast, underwire bras, or pressure from carrying purse or diaper bag, car seat or baby carrier.</li>
</ul>



<p>Mastitis can be caused by any of these risk factors, in addition to having sore cracked or bleeding nipples, which can serve as an entry point for an infection and possibly lead to a prolonged hospital stay. People with a history of plugged ducts or mastitis also are at an increased risk for a future infection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of plugged ducts, mastitis</h2>



<p>Plugged ducts and mastitis can be uncomfortable for people who are breastfeeding. Plugged duct symptoms progress gradually, and can include pain, a hard lump, a warm and painful localized spot or a wedge-shaped area of engorgement on the breast. Mastitis symptoms appear rapidly and include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue and body aches. The pain typically is more intense than a plugged duct, and the person also may notice red streaking on the breasts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention of plugged ducts, mastitis</h2>



<p>You may have heard the saying "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." That is true for breast pain caused by plugged ducts or mastitis.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To get your breastfeeding relationship with your infant off to its best start — and avoid complications such as mastitis — keep these tips in mind:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Breastfeed in different positions to allow for more thorough emptying of the breast.</li>



<li>Create a frequent feeding schedule and empty each breast completely. With a newborn, this could be eight to 12 feedings in 24 hours.</li>



<li>Establish a good latch at every feeding to empty the breast better and prevent damaging the nipple.</li>



<li>Use high-quality pure lanolin or lanolin ointment for sore, cracked or bleeding nipples.</li>



<li>Wear a well-fitting nursing bra, and avoid underwire bras or tight straps from clothing, bags, purses or infant carriers.</li>
</ul>



<p>It also may be helpful to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/breast-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meet with a lactation consultant</a>&nbsp;who can provide additional tips and advice on proper breastfeeding techniques.</p>



<p>People with frequent plugged ducts may see improvement by taking a supplement called lecithin, which can reduce the "stickiness" of the milk and prevent plugged ducts from occurring. In addition, new research has found that taking probiotics can prevent and decrease the incidence of mastitis and is safe during breastfeeding. Look for a probiotic that contains Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus salivarius.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment for plugged ducts, mastitis</h2>



<p>Treating a plugged duct immediately and aggressively is essential to prevent further progression, reduce pain and eliminate frustration.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment includes:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Eating a well-balanced, healthy diet.</li>



<li>Fully emptying the breast during each feeding through frequent feeding, hand expression, or pumping or feeding in different positions.</li>



<li>Heat can be applied to the breast before feeding to better empty the breast. To apply heat, fill a disposable diaper with warm water, squeeze out the excess water and place it on the breast.</li>



<li>Increasing fluid consumption.</li>



<li>Massage, emptying breasts often by hand expression, frequent feeding, and pumping and feeding in different positions to thoroughly empty breasts.</li>



<li>Rest.</li>



<li>Therapeutic breast massage taught by a certified lactation consultant.</li>
</ul>



<p>A healthcare professional may prescribe antibiotics if a person has mastitis, is acutely ill and the symptoms are persisting or worsening. Breastfeeding and expressed breast milk feeding are safe and recommended, even with antibiotic therapy.</p>



<p>It's safe to continue breastfeeding if you have mastitis or a plugged duct. Breastfeeding helps clear the infection or ductal system. Weaning your baby abruptly is likely to worsen your signs and symptoms.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric surgery</a> is more than just surgery. It's a lifestyle change that includes a lifelong <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/establishing-healthy-behaviors-that-stick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to eating healthy</a> with your dietitian's guidance and incorporating <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-5-elements-of-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regular exercise</a> into your routine.</p>



<p>After bariatric surgery, patients who regularly exercise for 60 minutes six days a week lose weight more quickly and dramatically improve their capacity for exercise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take advantage of peak weight-loss period</h2>



<p>The time to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/doctors-orders/need-to-exercise-start-slowly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">establish your exercise habits</a> is before you have the surgery. Then solidify that routine during the first year after surgery, which is when people typically find it easiest to lose weight.</p>



<p>After bariatric surgery, your body may try to hold onto its fat stores until its other energy sources are depleted. This can lead to the loss of muscle mass after surgery. To minimize or prevent the body from using muscle mass for energy, it's crucial to work your muscles regularly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some of the benefits of cardio, strength and endurance training are:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Improved heart condition, balance, stability and mood</li>



<li>Increased energy, lean muscle mass and bone density</li>



<li>Reduced body fat, risk of injury and stress</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Amp up, change your exercise routine</h2>



<p>When people lose weight, their energy expenditure — the number of calories the body burns — is reduced both at rest and during exercise. This means that when you lose weight, but continue the same exercise routine, you burn fewer calories than before you lost weight.</p>



<p>In addition, regular exercise increases your capacity and ability to work harder. As you become better conditioned, your workout will feel easier than when you first began. This is an indication that it's time to increase the exercise intensity.</p>



<p>You want to aim for a level of cardiorespiratory exercise that's somewhat difficult for you. One test of intensity is if you can talk in breathy sentences as you exercise. If you can't speak, scale back until you can.</p>



<p>Consider changing your exercise routine by <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/prevent-boredom-and-injury-during-physical-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying something new</a>. If you feel comfortable with your treadmill workout, try switching to another piece of equipment, such as an elliptical or cycle. Or take a class such as low-impact aerobics, spinning, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/aquatic-exercise-healthy-easy-on-the-body" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water fitness</a> or aerobic dance.</p>



<p>These tweaks to your routine can challenge your body in new ways and help maintain your interest in exercising. Workout variety also plays a significant role five to six months after bariatric surgery, when many patients experience a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/why-has-my-weight-plateaued-when-i-have-50-more-pounds-to-lose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss plateau</a>. Changing your exercise routine can minimize or even eliminate a plateau.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Increase exercise intensity, time, frequency</h2>



<p>As your fitness improves, you'll be able to increase the intensity, time or frequency of your exercise routine. One way to do that is through <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/interval-training-for-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-intensity interval training (HIIT)</a>. As with any new form of exercise, check with your healthcare team to make sure HIIT is a good fit for you.</p>



<p>A HIIT workout alternates between short intense bursts of exercise and active recovery, which is like a "breather" with less intense exercise. Research shows that HIIT workouts are more effective for heart health, fat loss and strength gain than traditional cardio and strength training. HIIT can be incorporated into nearly any exercise from running to water fitness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pay attention to strength training</h2>



<p>As you plan your routine, focus on <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/no-matter-your-age-or-skill-level-its-never-too-late-to-start-weight-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">muscle-strengthening exercises</a> at least three days a week, which will also improve your bone density and metabolism. Muscle burns calories even at rest, so if you increase your muscle mass, you will burn more calories throughout the day.</p>



<p>You can build muscle strength using weight machines, resistance bands, free weights and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/isometric-exercise-and-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your own body weight</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new lifestyle, not a chore</h2>



<p>You've undergone bariatric surgery not only to lose weight but also to improve your health. Reaching your goals requires changing your lifestyle, and exercise is essential to that success. Becoming a regular exerciser can be empowering, fun and open doors to meeting new people and broadening your interests.</p>



<p>To keep exercise from becoming a chore, find what you like to do, but switch it up to add variety and challenge your body in different ways. Cardio and strength training are both key to a successful exercise and weight-loss routine.</p>

<p>Added sugar in foods not only adds extra calories, it also can have direct toxic effects, such as tooth decay and even a risk for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>. Minimizing the amount of added sugar in your diet is important. However, you may not even realize how much added sugar you consume. That's because some unsuspecting foods you may think are healthy contain added sugar.</p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hensrud-donald-d-m-d-m-s/bio-20053543" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Donald Hensrud</a>, a Mayo Clinic physician specializing in nutrition and the editor of "<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/mayo-clinic-diet/art-20045460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mayo Clinic Diet</a>," explains what to look out for when trying to avoid added sugar.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (0:55) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/SCRIPT-MCM-Added-Sugar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"Anytime food is processed, there are certain things that are added. And it's often sugar or salt," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>When trying to identify how much added sugar is in packaged food, look at the nutrition food label. You might be surprised by what you find.</p>



<p>"Many things you wouldn't even suspect — some sauces, some dips, some spreads — there’s added sugars in almost every category of food products out there," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>Foods that can be surprising sources of added sugar:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Salad dressing</li>



<li>Condiments</li>



<li>Canned soup</li>



<li>Granola bars</li>



<li>Protein bars</li>
</ul>



<p>"It's been shown that, in many people, the amount of calories they get from added sugars is quite significant," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>Dr. Hensrud suggests paying close attention to food labels and trying to consume foods that contain natural sugars, like fruits, which are low in calories and contain vitamins and minerals.</p>
