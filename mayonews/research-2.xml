<p>Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center and Columbia University recently announced being named  the recipients of a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-columbia-university-receive-10-6-million-grant-from-nci-to-advance-glioblastoma-research-with-mathematical-oncology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$10.6 million grant from the National Cancer</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-columbia-university-receive-10-6-million-grant-from-nci-to-advance-glioblastoma-research-with-mathematical-oncology/"> Institute</a> to advance research in fighting glioblastoma - one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms of brain cancer. </p>



<p>Every year, thousands are diagnosed with the disease. Many are given little time to live. The prognosis is often poorer for older patients.</p>



<p>Researchers are searching for a cure. Meanwhile a team at Mayo Clinic is also looking for ways to help elderly patients diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-is-glioblastoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a> live longer and maintain quality of life. </p>



<p>Now, an investigational study at Mayo Clinic using an innovative approach to treatment has shown promise in improving health outcomes for people like Richard Casper.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Love at first sight</h2>



<p>Richard and Carol Casper were in their early 20s when they met. Carol was smitten, but not sure Richard would call her again.</p>



<p>"So, anyway, he did," recalls Carol with a twinkle in her eye. "That's where it all started in 1962, and we got married in 1964." </p>



<p>Children soon followed, and their family began traveling the world with Richard's career in the U.S. Air Force.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="802" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-802x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378587" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-802x1024.png 802w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-235x300.png 235w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-768x981.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM.png 844w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Richard and Carol on their wedding day in 1964</strong>                                                                                                                                                 Photo courtesy: Casper family</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The day their world changed&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After nearly 30 years of military service, the couple was looking forward to retirement. Then suddenly, in 2019, Richard suffered a seizure and their world came crashing down. Testing began to identify the cause of his seizures. </p>



<p>Ultimately surgery confirmed the family's worst fear - brain cancer.</p>



<p>"That's when we got the definite diagnosis that it was <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-is-glioblastoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma, stage 4,</a>" says Carol. Doctors told the family Richard had less than a year to live.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We were hit with a bomb."</p><cite>Carol Casper, Richard's wife</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Glioblastoma: The deadliest form of brain cancer&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Glioblastoma is one of the most complex and fast-growing forms of brain cancer. It is also the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, though it can strike at any age. It can form in the spinal cord or the brain.</p>



<p>"It carries the worst prognosis, and it has to do with the aggressiveness of the cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist with Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona. "Despite our best treatments, we see patients continue to recur, which requires additional treatments over time." &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://braintumor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Brain Tumor Society</a>, more than 14,490 Americans are expected to be diagnosed in 2023. They estimate approximately 10,000 will die from the disease.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research to improve patient outcomes</h2>



<p>Dr. Vora has been researching brain tumors and ways to improve patient outcomes for the past two decades. His team is now investigating an innovative treatment protocol for elderly patients, like Richard, who are often given less time than average to live. </p>



<p>"Most of these patients are in the six- to nine-month range," says Dr. Vora. "We're looking for ways of providing more effective and better treatments for patients in terms of both quality and quantity of life."</p>



<p>Richard sought treatment at Mayo Clinic in Arizona under the care of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-alyx-b-m-d/bio-20055164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alyx Porter, M.D</a>., a neuro-oncologist. "When people come in, it is one of the scariest times in their life," says Dr. Porter. "My job is to provide them with comfort, reassurance and direction as to what the next steps will be."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Let me do the worrying, and you all do the living."</p><cite>Neuro-oncologist Dr. Alyx Porter speaking to the Casper family</cite></blockquote></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic's multidisciplinary approach</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic's healthcare model is based on a team approach. Physicians from a variety of disciplines work together to explore the best treatment options for a patient and deliver the highest level of care.</p>



<p>Richard's family was aware there was likely no cure. What&nbsp;they wanted was more time than his prognosis.&nbsp;His healthcare team agreed Richard was an ideal candidate for the clinical trial. Richard told doctors he was ready to be a participant.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Sign me up. I just need to get my balance back, and I think I'll be able to roll with the punch."&nbsp;</p><cite>Richard Casper </cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Targeting cancer cells with advanced medical imaging</h2>



<p>Radiation and chemotherapy are often used to try and slow progression of the cancer. The study is investigating an innovative approach researchers hope will help elderly glioblastoma patients live longer with fewer symptoms of the cancer and side effects from treatment.</p>



<p>It incorporates the use of an advanced medical imaging technique, called 18F-DOPA PET and MRI to target specific areas of the brain for treatment and spare healthy tissue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="557" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1024x557.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378592" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1024x557.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-300x163.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-768x418.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1536x836.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-2048x1114.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Dr. Vora showing how 18F-DOPA PET/MRI is being studied as a way to help improve treatment of glioblastoma</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"18F-DOPA is more or less a special type of sugar that cancer cells take at a faster rate compared to healthy cells that is very specific for glioblastoma. So, with this PET scan, we can actually now identify areas in the brain that are felt to be at highest risk for tumor growth," says Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>The other critical part of this regimen is that it's much more convenient for patients. "Instead of the traditional three to six weeks' worth of radiation, we're able to complete their entire treatment in one to two weeks, which allows more time for patients to stay with their family," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p>The areas are then targeted with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-proton-beam-therapy-bolsters-cancer-treatment/">proton beam therapy</a> to destroy cancer cells. Proton beam therapy is innovative technology that can painlessly deliver higher doses of radiation, in a shorter amount of time, with fewer side effects. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="566" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1024x566.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378595" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1024x566.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-300x166.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-768x424.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1536x849.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-2048x1131.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Proton beam therapy delivers higher doses of radiation in shorter amounts of time often with fewer side effects</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I felt great," says Richard after completing his treatment. "I wouldn't even know I have a brain tumor right now if someone didn't tell me so." </p>



<p>Dr. Porter credits the study's treatment protocol. "With the shorter course of treatment, it saved him from many of the side effects that we know can be as devastating as the disease itself. He was able to finish the treatment, unscathed, walking and dancing into my office thrilled at how good he actually felt."&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Richard beats the odds&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Richard survived almost twice longer than his original prognosis while maintaining his quality of life. "My dad defied the odds and kept going," says Susan, Richard's daughter. "To be almost 2 ½ years in after being told you only have a few months left to live, is quite remarkable."</p>

<p>The Casper family says they're proud of Richard's courage to help in the fight against cancer. "What he went through, and even during the trial, made a big difference in helping other people," says Carol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Richard maintained his valiant battle till the end. He died on March 8, 2023.&nbsp;"All of us at Mayo feel very fortunate to have known Mr. Casper," says Dr. Vora. "He was a very special person."</p>



<p>Dr. Vora presented results of the trial at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology. </p>



<p>"The results are quite promising," says Dr. Vora. "We're hoping to see these results carried on in a larger-scale study. If we continue to see the same types of results, we feel it could be a good option moving forward for all cancer patients."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers make new discoveries, develop first-of-its-kind tools and technologies and constantly improve upon existing ones with the goal to provide the best in healthcare. The following 10 stories are a round-up of some of the most significant medical research advances at Mayo Clinic this year from harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to detect disease sooner to advancing treatments for rare and complex diseases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advancing ultrasound microvessel imaging and AI to improve cancer detection</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="158" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/High-resolution-3D-ultrasound-images-of-breast-cancer-300x158.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379562" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/High-resolution-3D-ultrasound-images-of-breast-cancer-300x158.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/High-resolution-3D-ultrasound-images-of-breast-cancer-768x403.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/High-resolution-3D-ultrasound-images-of-breast-cancer.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>


<p>Tumors consist not only of cancer cells but also a matrix of small blood vessels, or microvessels, that cannot be seen in the images produced by conventional ultrasound machines. To solve this problem, physician-scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/alizad-azra-m-d/bio-00085586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azra Alizad, M.D.</a>, and biomedical engineering scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fatemi-mostafa-ph-d/bio-00086282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostafa Fatemi, Ph.D.</a>, teamed up at Mayo Clinic to design and study a tool that may improve the resolution of ultrasound imaging. As demonstrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, they developed high-resolution ultrasound imaging software, compatible with many ultrasound machines, that could exponentially improve both the detail and quality of images.</p>



<p>"If we can visualize and capture the microvessel in the earliest stages of cancer, we can better diagnose and treat it earlier, which improves the outcome for the patient," says Dr. Alizad, who specializes in ultrasound technology for cancer imaging.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/10/11/advancing-ultrasound-microvessel-imaging-and-ai-to-improve-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Harnessing the immune system to fight ovarian cancer</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Female-reproductive-system-and-cancer-cells-GettyImages-1334433530-300x200-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379560" /></figure></div>


<p>Mayo Clinic research is biomanufacturing an experimental, cell-based ovarian cancer vaccine and combining it with immunotherapy to study a "one-two punch" approach to halting disease progression in ovarian cancer patients. This research begins with a blood draw from women with advanced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>&nbsp;whose tumors have returned after standard surgery and chemotherapy. White blood cells are extracted from the blood, biomanufactured to become dendritic cells and are returned to the patient. Dendritic cells act as crusaders that march through the body, triggering the immune system to recognize and fight cancer.</p>



<p>"We're building on an earlier phase 1 clinical trial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18962-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that showed promising results</a>&nbsp;in terms of survival after the dendritic cell-based vaccine," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, co-principal investigator and medical oncologist. "Of the 18 evaluable patients in the phase 1 study, 11 had cancer return, but seven of them — 40%&nbsp;— have been cancer-free for almost 10 years. We typically expect 90% of patients in this condition to have the cancer return."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/19/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-ovarian-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Mayo Clinic prepares to biomanufacture a new CAR-T cell therapy for B-cell blood cancers</strong></strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="225" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/CAR-T-shutterstock_686272324-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379556" /></figure></div>


<p>Mayo Clinic research has developed a new type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</a>&nbsp;aimed at killing B-cell blood cancers that have returned and are no longer responding to treatment. This pioneering technology, designed and developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, killed B-cell tumors grown in the laboratory and tumors implanted in mouse models. The preclinical findings are published in&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00262-023-03537-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy</a>.</p>



<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/11/mayo-clinic-prepares-to-biomanufacture-a-new-car-t-cell-therapy-for-b-cell-blood-cancers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artificial Intelligence is forging a new future for gastroenterology</strong></h2>

<p>Colonoscopy remains the gold standard in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer. But the procedure has limitations. Some studies suggest that&nbsp;more than half&nbsp;of post-colonoscopy colon cancer cases arise from lesions that were missed at patients’ previous colonoscopies.</p>



<p>"AI, particularly the subset of AI called computer vision, is naturally suited to what we do through the endoscope," says Michael B. Wallace, M.D., who describes himself as a bit of a technology geek.</p>



<p>In 2022, Dr. Wallace&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35304117/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published the results</a>&nbsp;of an international, multicenter study testing the impact of adding AI to routine colonoscopies. His team, which included James East, M.D., a gastroenterologist at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London</a>, as well as researchers from the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Germany and Ireland, found that incorporating AI into colonoscopies reduced the risk of missing polyps by 50%.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/02/03/artificial-intelligence-is-forging-a-new-future-for-gastroenterology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Just months after 9-year-old Mayo Clinic patient Maggie Carmichael started taking an experimental drug for her ultra-rare genetic disease that is part of a category of diseases known as<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/clinical-genomics/overview/specialty-groups/cdg-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;congenital disorders of glycosylation</a>, she was able to trade in her wheelchair for a walker. Maggie’s treating physician is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/morava-kozicz-eva-m-d-ph-d/bio-20431520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eva Morava-Kozicz, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a translational scientist at Mayo Clinic who&nbsp;is at the forefront of research on congenital disorders of glycosylation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34652821/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent discovery</a>, Dr. Morava-Kozicz and her collaborators found that one of the major culprits of congenital disorders of glycosylation is a buildup of a substance called sorbitol, which is a type of sugar alcohol that is produced in the body when glucose is metabolized. Dr. Morava-Kozicz says the sorbitol discovery opened the door to a diagnostic biomarker for the disease and for tracking disease severity. She says the biomarker advancement provided a strategy for implementing potential drug candidates.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/03/01/mayo-clinic-discovery-leads-to-life-changing-treatment-for-young-girl-with-ultra-rare-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Clinicians and researchers around the world are combining artificial intelligence, known as AI, with health care to help identify patients at greater risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ai-cardiology/overview/ovc-20486648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke and heart failure.</a>&nbsp;However, as use of these AI-enhanced tools grows, researchers at Mayo Clinic are asking, "Do these tools work reliably for people of color?" and "Are they accessible in community health care settings?"</p>



<p>"AI-based health interventions are frequently developed and deployed without race-specific data analysis or validation," says David Harmon, M.D., Mayo Clinic cardiology fellow. "It's important to make sure these tools are reliable and accessible to all, particularly people of color who are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/health-disparities-and-inequities">disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease</a>."&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/01/24/can-ai-enhanced-heart-screening-address-health-disparities/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a look back at 10 (of many) of Mayo Clinic’s influential precision medicine research studies of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Mayo Clinic organoid study reveals possible key link to autism spectrum disorder</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft is-resized"><a href="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/cerebral-organoids2-002.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/cerebral-organoids2-002-1024x580.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13093" style="width:308px;height:auto" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Using miniaturized human brain models known as organoids, Mayo Clinic and Yale University scientists have discovered that the roots of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352928">autism spectrum disorder</a>&nbsp;may be associated with an imbalance of specific neurons that play a critical role in how the brain communicates and functions. The specific cells are known as excitatory cortical neurons. Led by &nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/abyzov-alexej-ph-d/bio-20089449">Alexej Abyzov, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;the new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01399-0">study</a>, published in Nature Neuroscience, reveals an abnormal imbalance of excitatory neurons in the forebrain of people with the disorder, with variations depending on their head size.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/08/10/mayo-clinic-mini-brain-study-reveals-possible-key-link-to-autism-spectrum-disorder/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>In a new preclinical study, scientists at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/research/programs/precision-cancer-therapeutics">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a>&nbsp;have discovered insights into the root cause of diabetic gastroparesis. Published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508523048886">Gastroenterology</a>, the study, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ordog-tamas-m-d/bio-00095251">Tamas Ordog, M.D</a>., zeroed in on a gene-regulating protein in the gastrointestinal tract called hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A), which is known to help cells respond to low oxygen levels. The scientists found that HIF1A is also a key factor in regulating an enzyme called neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) within stomach nerve cells. As a result of this discovery, Dr. Ordog suggests that targeting H1F1A may be a useful therapeutic strategy.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/05/mayo-clinic-research-uncovers-epigenetic-roots-of-a-digestive-disorder-associated-with-diabetes/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>A specific colonization of microbes in the reproductive tract is commonly found in women with ovarian cancer, according to a new study from Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine">Center for Individualized Medicine</a>. Published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27555-x">Scientific Reports</a>&nbsp;and led by<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/walther-antonio-marina-r-ph-d/bio-20087609">&nbsp;Marina Walther-Antonio, Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;and Abigail Asangba, Ph.D., the discovery strengthens evidence that the bacterial component of the microbiome — a community of microorganisms that also consists of viruses, yeasts and fungi — is an important indicator for early detection, diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian cancer. The study also suggests that a higher accumulation of pathogenic microbes plays a role in treatment outcomes and could be a potential indicator for predicting a patient's prognosis and response to therapy.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/01/16/mayo-clinic-researchers-link-ovarian-cancer-to-bacteria-colonization-in-microbiome/">Read more</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Could antidepressants cause treatment-emergent mania?</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright is-resized"><a href="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/antidepressants2.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/antidepressants2-1024x490.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13096" style="width:359px;height:auto" /></a></figure></div>


<p>In a new Mayo Clinic study, researchers have pinpointed a potential risk linked to antidepressants that boost mitochondrial energetics — a process responsible for extracting energy from nutrients to sustain cellular life. The findings suggest that such antidepressants may elevate the risk of treatment-emergent mania. The heightened energy expenditure during mania is linked to impulsivity, poor judgment, psychosis, and a loss of insight, often leading to high-risk behaviors that can result in hospitalization or incarceration. Published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01888-x">Molecular Psychiatry</a>, the study, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/frye-mark-a-m-d/bio-00077016">Mark Frye, M.D.</a>, specifically investigated the risk of treatment-emergent mania in people with bipolar disorder undergoing antidepressant treatment. The data suggest categorizing antidepressants based on mitochondrial energetics may be of value.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/01/24/could-antidepressants-cause-treatment-emergent-mania/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>The Tapestry study, an extensive and decentralized genomic sequencing clinical research study, aims to complete exome sequencing for 100,000 Mayo Clinic patients. The results will be integrated into the patients’ Electronic Health Record for three hereditary conditions, and the amassed data will contribute to a distinctive research dataset stored within the Mayo Clinic Cloud on the Omics Data Platform. The overall hope of Tapestry is to accelerate discoveries in individualized medicine to tailor prevention, diagnosis and treatment to a patient's unique genetic makeup. It is poised to advance evidence that exome sequencing, when applied to a diverse and comprehensive general population, can proficiently identify carriers of genetic variants that put them at higher risk for a disease so that they can take preventative measures.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/03/21/a-big-step-forward-bringing-dna-sequencing-data-to-routine-patient-care/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Nine people around the world who have been living with unexplained, muscular dystrophy-like symptoms may now have an answer for what is causing the progressive muscle weakness in their body’s mid-section, arms and legs. In a new discovery, a collaborative team of scientists led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;has pinpointed alterations in a single gene deep inside these people's genetic blueprint as the root cause of their ultra-rare disorder, known as&nbsp;<a href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6907/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy">limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</a>. For some, the onset of debilitating muscle-wasting symptoms began in childhood, while others started having trouble walking, running, climbing stairs and breathing in adulthood. The new study describing their discovery is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929723001301">published</a>&nbsp;in the American Journal of Human Genetics.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/07/03/mayo-clinic-discovery-leads-to-diagnoses-of-9-people-with-rare-form-of-muscular-dystrophy/">Read more.</a></p>

<p>Scientists at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;have developed an artificial intelligence method, called Spatially Informed Artificial Intelligence (SPIN-AI). This new deep-learning technique can analyze the genetic information of individual cells to reconstruct the precise layout of the cells in a tissue, without preexisting knowledge of how the cells are organized.&nbsp; The scientists say their findings could potentially pave the way for individualized treatments that target the specific cellular traits of each person.

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/taneja-veena-ph-d/bio-00027247">Veena Taneja, Ph.D.</a>, have discovered a link between an abundance of specific gut bacteria and the triggering of an immune response against a person's tissue. The new study, published in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37656793/">Science Advances</a>, reveals an immune response occurs even before the clinical symptoms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648">rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;appear. Using a preclinical model, the researchers determined that the gut bacteria Eggerthella lenta causes an autoimmune response before the onset of the clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. In that response, the immune system produces autoantibodies that mistakenly target and attack the body's tissues and cells instead of foreign invaders, such as bacteria or viruses.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/18/mayo-clinic-researchers-identify-link-between-gut-bacteria-and-pre-clinical-autoimmunity-and-aging-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have identified a key gene, CDCP1, linked to improvement in heart function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a common cause of heart failure. The study, the first genome-wide association of its kind, reveals that a genetic variation in CDCP1 influences susceptibility to the condition and response to therapies. The gene's connection to cardiac fibrosis and the biomarker known as sST2 opens avenues for potential drug therapies targeting CDCP1 to mitigate adverse effects of heart failure. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37800334/">study</a>, led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pereira-naveen-l-m-d/bio-20178506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</a> is published in Circulation Research. <a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/11/27/mayo-clinic-study-explores-heart-failure-uncovers-genes-role-in-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.  </p>

<p>A team of researchers at Mayo Clinic has discovered that using fluorescent green dye combined with imaging during surgery for soft tissue sarcoma can help surgeons determine what tissue may be at risk of poor healing. This information allows surgeons to change the wound closure to reduce the risk of complications as the patient heals.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/soft-tissue-sarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20377725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soft tissue sarcoma</a>&nbsp;forms in tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures, including muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and the lining of joints. An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=The%20American%20Cancer%20Society's%20estimates,males%20and%206%2C000%20in%20females)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated 13,400 people</a>&nbsp;will be diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma in 2023.&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/fulltext/2021/08000/a_prospective_evaluation_of_intraoperative.7.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More than 30% of people</a>&nbsp;who receive radiation treatment before surgery to remove the cancer experience complications with their surgical wounds.</p>



<p>Patients receive the dye, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/indocyanine-green-interstitial-route-intradermal-route-intravenous-route/description/drg-20155722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indocyanine green</a>,  through an IV during surgery. When paired with imaging, the technology is called intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography. The technique allows surgeons to assess the amount of blood flowing in an area of tissue, called tissue perfusion. A lack of blood flow indicates a potential problem with tissue. Surgeons can then remove any tissue that lacks blood flow.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/monitor-632w-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379511" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/monitor-632w-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/monitor-632w.jpg 632w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Wound closure<br></strong>On the monitor, the surgeon views the incision during surgery. The white color indicates blood flowing to the tissue. If blood flow was insufficient, the monitor would show a dark spot.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"It basically changed our practice," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sherman-courtney-e-m-d/bio-20055611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Courtney Sherman, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic oncologist who led the research. "This technology gave us eyes beyond human eyes — a window into the blood supply to the patient's skin."</p>



<p>The team published its findings in the&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaos/fulltext/2021/05150/intraoperative_indocyanine_green_fluorescence.8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</a>&nbsp;(JAAOS) in May 2021 and in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/fulltext/2021/08000/a_prospective_evaluation_of_intraoperative.7.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Research and Reviews</a>&nbsp;in August 2021.</p>



<p>While the surgical technique isn’t yet in standard use for soft tissue sarcoma care across the U.S., surgeons caring for people with soft tissue sarcoma at Mayo Clinic now regularly use ICG fluorescence angiography.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How wound issues complicate healing for people with soft tissue sarcoma</h2>



<p>Soft tissue sarcoma often affects the arms and legs; surgery is a common treatment. The surgeon usually removes the cancer as well as some healthy tissue around it.</p>



<p>Patients typically receive radiation therapy to shrink the cancer before surgery, says Dr. Sherman. Orthopedic oncologists believe the combination of surgery and radiation&nbsp;<a href="https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7276567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increases the likelihood</a>&nbsp;that a surgeon can remove the cancer without needing to remove the entire limb.</p>



<p>Though modern radiation therapy is significantly more precise than in previous decades, it still may damage healthy cells along with cancer cells. This may lead to infection, or the radiation may destroy the genetic material in healthy cells and cut off blood supply. Over time, tissue that lacks blood supply dies, and the patient may require another surgery to remove this additional tissue.</p>



<p>Treatment for soft tissue sarcoma with radiation therapy followed by surgery has an infection risk of 38% for all patients. The risk of the surgical incision reopening in the same group is 42.3%, says Dr. Sherman.</p>



<p>"Wound healing issues disrupt the patient's treatment," says Dr. Sherman. "Due to wound complications, there has been a lot of 'back to the&nbsp;OR' for patients who have radiation therapy plus surgery for soft tissue sarcoma. It's a big deal if we can keep these patients out of the&nbsp;OR."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic’s research on ICG fluorescence</h2>



<p>In their&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaos/fulltext/2021/05150/intraoperative_indocyanine_green_fluorescence.8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 2021 JAAOS article</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers described their finding that&nbsp;ICG fluorescence&nbsp;angiography could not only predict wound complications for patients who had radiation therapy before surgery but also allow surgeons to make changes during the procedure to reduce the risk of complications. The 23-patient study found that intraoperative ICG fluorescence angiography could predict with a high degree of accuracy where complications with wound healing might occur, particularly for patients with soft tissue sarcoma in the lower extremities of the body (from the hip down).</p>



<p>For the&nbsp;AAOS&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/fulltext/2021/08000/a_prospective_evaluation_of_intraoperative.7.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Research and Reviews</a>&nbsp;article in August 2021, Dr. Sherman and the research team reported on a study conducted between October 2017 and September 2019 based on records for patients who received surgery for soft tissue sarcoma with ICG fluorescence angiography. The researchers compared these patients' experiences to those of patients who had received surgery without&nbsp;ICG&nbsp;fluorescence angiography. The study included 88 patients. Researchers found significantly lower rates of infection and surgical incisions reopening in patients who received ICG&nbsp;angiography compared with patients whose surgery did not include this technology.</p>



<p>"Using&nbsp;ICG&nbsp;green fluorescence is simple, straightforward and effective," says Dr. Sherman. “It’s making recovery less challenging for people with soft tissue sarcoma by reducing complications from surgery."</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;has advanced the development and biomanufacturing of novel therapeutics, called biologics, for cancer and inflammatory conditions into clinical trials.</p>



<p>"My dream has been to develop innovative technologies that go beyond treating symptoms to curing diseases. The ultimate aim is to ensure that these advancements are accessible to all patients in need," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, the Michael S. and Mary Sue Shannon Director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Dr. Allickson is also the Otto Bremer Trust Director, Biomanufacturing and Product Development, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Biomanufacturing uses living organisms to manufacture medicines known as biologics that are made from human sources such as blood and cells. Biologics have shown potential for targeted healing with few side effects.</p>



<p>The biomanufacturing process is like a bridge that moves biologics from the lab into first-in-human clinical trials. From there, Mayo Clinic aims to license these technologies to industry collaborators who can conduct clinical trials and commercialize them, thereby making them accessible to patients worldwide.</p>



<p>"To ensure broad access to new medicines, the most effective approach is to bring them to market," says Dr. Allickson. "We are evaluating the scientific rigor required to scale up the production of new drugs. Additionally, we are establishing a streamlined process for advanced biomanufacturing that incorporates automation. Our goal is to transfer production of the medicines to companies capable of replicating our manufacturing process. This will enable them to advance the technology toward obtaining regulatory approval."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Groundbreaking treatments for cancer</strong></h3>



<p>The Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics has reached several milestones in forwarding cutting edge cell therapies to early-stage clinical trials at Mayo Clinic, including:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing a Mayo Clinic-developed chimeric antigen therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</strong></h3>



<p>Chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/gnc-20405215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(CAR-T cell therapy)</a> is a regenerative immunotherapy in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to recognize and stop cancer. A new CAR-T cell therapy developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is aimed at B cell blood cancers that have returned and no longer respond to treatment. Mayo Clinic in Florida is preparing to biomanufacture this new cancer drug, known as BAFF-R, for a phase 1 clinical trial in early 2024. Dr. Qin is working on additional new CAR-T technologies for treating cancer.</p>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic we firmly believe that biomanufacturing CAR-T cell therapy on-site will expedite this lifesaving treatment to patients," says Dr. Allickson. "Backlogs can occur when cells are sent to an external manufacturer, causing delays that cancer patients can’t afford."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing an experimental cell-based ovarian cancer vaccine.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In this pioneering research led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/knutson-keith-l-ph-d/bio-00026672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keith Knutson, Ph.D.</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, white blood cells are extracted from blood, biomanufactured to become dendritic cells and returned to the patient. Dendritic cells act as crusaders that march through the body, triggering the immune system to halt disease progression. Manufacturing the cells at Mayo Clinic is critical so adjustments can be made for each patient's individual cancer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New biomanufacturing facilities open</strong></h3>



<p>Mayo Clinic is expanding the number of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) facilities needed to manufacture biologic therapies for clinical trials. CGMP facilities are clean rooms where therapeutic agents are manufactured in environments free of contamination and meet Food and Drug Administration specifications for safety, identity, strength, purity and quality.</p>



<p>Three new clean rooms opened recently in Florida. A new CGMP facility in One Discovery Square in Rochester, Minn., is ready to begin operations. Mayo Clinic in Arizona is taking an innovative approach of setting up CGMP clean rooms for 3D printing and 3D bioprinting. Mayo Clinic is among the first academic medical centers to 3D bioprint living cells, bones, or organs.</p>



<p>"What differentiates Mayo Clinic is its ability to 3D bioprint cells with CGMP bioprinters in a CGMP-compliant clean room," says Dr. Allickson. "This unique ability distinguishes us as a leader in this field for which we are gaining increasing recognition for our expertise."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A look ahead to 2024</strong></h2>



<p>The Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics has advanced several cell-based therapies to the process and analytical development stage in preparation for biomanufacturing in 2024. Process development establishes standard operating procedures for manufacturing to ensure an experimental therapy is safe and of consistent quality for testing on humans in clinical trials.</p>



<p>Technologies in process development include:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oncolytic virus for a two-pronged attack on cancer</strong></h3>



<p>The team of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vile-richard-g-ph-d/bio-00027663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Vile, Ph.D</a>., is developing genetically engineered viruses with potential to not only destroy cancer, but also trigger an immune response for a second wave of cancer destruction. This technology, known as oncolytic virus, will be combined with CAR-T cell therapy&nbsp;to target solid tumors in patients with liver cancer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Immune cells to address inflammatory conditions</strong></h3>



<p>Supported by a grant from the Skoll Foundation, researchers are studying immune cells to address inflammatory conditions. They are investigating whether these cells and their secretomes could be possible treatments for inflammatory conditions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lupus/symptoms-causes/syc-20365789" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lupus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. Immune cells defend the body against infection. Secretomes are the healing properties released by cells.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CAR-T cell therapy targeting thyroid cancer, graft-versus-host disease and inflammatory bowel disease</strong></h3>



<p>Groundbreaking technology developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, would expand CAR-T cell therapy beyond blood cancers to solid tumors. This discovery targets thyroid hormone stimulating receptor (TSHR) found on the surface of thyroid cancer tumors. Also in process development is a unique CAR-T cell therapy from Dr. Kenderian' s lab developed from mesenchymal stem cells. It will initially treat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/videos/graft-vs-host-disease-gvhd-mayo-clinic/vid-20433405#:~:text=Marrow%20Transplant%20Division.-,Graft%20vs.,and%20they%20reject%20your%20body." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graft-versus-host disease</a>, a rare complication from a bone marrow transplant, and inflammatory bowel disease.</p>



<p>Dr. Allickson sees an exciting year ahead that will include research and development of Regulatory T-cells, often called "Tregs."&nbsp; Tregs play a critical role in regulating the immune system. They show potential for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colitis</a>&nbsp;in which the body mistakenly attacks healthy cells.</p>



<p>"It's a privilege and an honor to be at Mayo Clinic where we can research and develop promising long-term or permanent solutions for patients with rare and complex disease," says Dr. Allickson.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic researchers make new discoveries, develop first-of-its-kind tools and technologies and constantly improve upon existing ones with the goal to provide the best in healthcare. The following five stories are a round-up of some of the most significant medical research advances at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> over the past year. Discoveries range from harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to detect disease sooner to advancing treatments for rare and complex diseases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/10/11/advancing-ultrasound-microvessel-imaging-and-ai-to-improve-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advancing ultrasound microvessel imaging and AI to improve cancer detection</a></h2>



<p>Tumors consist not only of cancer cells but also a matrix of small blood vessels, or microvessels, that cannot be seen in the images produced by conventional ultrasound machines. To solve this problem, physician-scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/alizad-azra-m-d/bio-00085586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azra Alizad, M.D.</a>, and biomedical engineering scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fatemi-mostafa-ph-d/bio-00086282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostafa Fatemi, Ph.D.</a>, teamed up at Mayo Clinic to design and study a tool that may improve the resolution of ultrasound imaging. As demonstrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, they developed high-resolution ultrasound imaging software, compatible with many ultrasound machines, that could exponentially improve both the detail and quality of images. See the animation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCtLfFbWcEo&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>"If we can visualize and capture the microvessel in the earliest stages of cancer, we can better diagnose and treat it earlier, which improves the outcome for the patient," says Dr. Alizad, who specializes in ultrasound technology for cancer imaging.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/10/11/advancing-ultrasound-microvessel-imaging-and-ai-to-improve-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic research is biomanufacturing an experimental, cell-based ovarian cancer vaccine and combining it with immunotherapy to study a "one-two punch" approach to halting disease progression in ovarian cancer patients. This research begins with a blood draw from women with advanced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>&nbsp;whose tumors have returned after standard surgery and chemotherapy. White blood cells are extracted from the blood, biomanufactured to become dendritic cells and are returned to the patient. Dendritic cells act as crusaders that march through the body, triggering the immune system to recognize and fight cancer.</p>



<p>"We're building on an earlier phase 1 clinical trial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18962-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that showed promising results</a>&nbsp;in terms of survival after the dendritic cell-based vaccine," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, co-principal investigator and medical oncologist. "Of the 18 evaluable patients in the phase 1 study, 11 had cancer return, but seven of them — 40%&nbsp;— have been cancer-free for almost 10 years. We typically expect 90% of patients in this condition to have the cancer return."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/19/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-ovarian-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic research has developed a new type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</a>&nbsp;aimed at killing B-cell blood cancers that have returned and are no longer responding to treatment. This pioneering technology, designed and developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, killed B-cell tumors grown in the laboratory and tumors implanted in mouse models.

<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/11/mayo-clinic-prepares-to-biomanufacture-a-new-car-t-cell-therapy-for-b-cell-blood-cancers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Colonoscopy remains the gold standard in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer. But the procedure has limitations. Some studies suggest that&nbsp;more than half&nbsp;of post-colonoscopy colon cancer cases arise from lesions that were missed at patients’ previous colonoscopies.</p>



<p>"AI, particularly the subset of AI called computer vision, is naturally suited to what we do through the endoscope," says Michael B. Wallace, M.D., who describes himself as a bit of a technology geek.</p>



<p>In 2022, Dr. Wallace&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35304117/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published the results</a>&nbsp;of an international, multicenter study testing the impact of adding AI to routine colonoscopies.

<p>"The study provides the first prospective data supporting the use of shorter-course proton PMRT, including in patients with immediate breast reconstruction, and the first mature results of a randomized trial in the field of breast particle therapy," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mutter-robert-w-m-d/bio-20343551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Mutter, M.D.</a>, a radiation oncologist and physician-scientist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic researchers mapped how the measles virus mutated and spread in the brain of a person who succumbed to a rare, lethal brain disease. New cases of this disease, which is a complication of the measles virus, may occur as measles reemerges among the unvaccinated, say researchers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="236" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Portrait_R_Cattaneo-236x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379378" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Portrait_R_Cattaneo-236x300.jpg 236w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Portrait_R_Cattaneo-806x1024.jpg 806w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Portrait_R_Cattaneo-768x976.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Portrait_R_Cattaneo.jpg 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Roberto Cattaneo, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Using the latest tools in genetic sequencing, researchers at Mayo Clinic reconstructed how a collective of viral genomes colonized a human brain. The virus acquired distinct mutations that drove the spread of the virus from the frontal cortex outward.</p>



<p>"Our study provides compelling data that shows how viral RNA mutated and spread throughout a human organ — the brain, in this case," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/cattaneo-roberto-ph-d/bio-00027692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Cattaneo, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic virologist who is a co-lead author on a new <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1011817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PLOS Pathogens study</a>. "Our discoveries will help studying and understanding how other viruses persist and adapt to the human brain, causing disease. This knowledge may facilitate the generation of effective antiviral drugs."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is measles?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Measles</a> is one of the most contagious diseases. The measles virus infects the upper respiratory tract where it uses the trachea, or windpipe, as a trampoline to launch and spread through droplets dispersed when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</p>



<p>Dr. Cattaneo pioneered <a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2019/08/28/insight-into-how-measles-might-reach-the-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> on how the measles virus spreads throughout the body.</p>



<p>He first began to study the measles virus about 40 years ago and was fascinated by the rare, lethal brain disease called <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/subacute-sclerosing-panencephalitis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)</a>, which occurs in about 1 in every 10,000 measles cases. It can take about five to 10 years after the initial infection for the measles virus to mutate and spread throughout the brain. Symptoms of this progressive neurological disease include memory loss, seizures and immobility. Dr. Cattaneo studied SSPE for several years until the lethal disease nearly disappeared as more people were vaccinated against measles.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Iris-Yousaf-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379376" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Iris-Yousaf-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Iris-Yousaf.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Iris Yousaf</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>However, measles is resurging due to vaccine hesitancy and missed vaccinations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of children missed receiving their measles vaccinations, which has resulted in an estimated 18% increase in measles cases and 43% increase in death from measles in 2021 compared to 2022 worldwide, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7246a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>.</p>



<p>"We suspect SSPE cases will rise again as well. This is sad because this horrible disease can be prevented by vaccination. But now we are in the position to study SSPE with modern, genetic sequencing technology and learn more about it," says Iris Yousaf, co-lead author of the study and a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Cattaneo and Yousaf had a unique research opportunity through a collaboration with the CDC. They studied the brain of a person who had contracted measles as a child and had succumbed to SSPE years later as an adult. They investigated 15 specimens from different regions of the brain and conducted genetic sequencing on each region to piece together the puzzle of how the measles virus mutated and spread.</p>



<p>The researchers discovered that, after the measles virus entered the brain, its genome — the complete set of genetic material for the virus — began to change in harmful ways. The genome replicated, creating other genomes that were slightly different. Then, these genomes replicated again — resulting in more genomes that were each a little different as well. The virus did this multiple times, creating a population of varied genomes.</p>



<p>"In this population, two specific genomes had a combination of characteristics that worked together to promote virus spread from the initial location of the infection — the frontal cortex of the brain — out to colonize the entire organ," says Dr. Cattaneo.</p>



<p>The next steps in this research are to understand how specific mutations favor virus spread in the brain. These studies will be done in cultivated brain cells and in clusters of cells resembling the brain called organoids. This knowledge may help in creating effective antiviral drugs to combat virus spread in the brain. However, pharmacological intervention in advanced disease stages is challenging. Preventing SSPE through measles vaccination remains the best method.</p>

<p>The<a href="http://www.minnesotapartnership.info/"> </a><a href="http://www.minnesotapartnership.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minnesota Partnership for Biotechnology and Medical Genomics (MNP)</a> has announced its five research awardees for 2023. MNP is funded by the State of Minnesota and provides support for innovative research conducted by collaborative teams from the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Totaling $6.75 million, this year’s awards support innovative projects on cancer, rare genetic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive aging and new health models to study diseases.</p>



<p>The award-winning projects are:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Minnesota Functional Omics Resource (MNFORce)</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic; Mark Osborn, Ph.D., University of Minnesota</p>



<p>Rare genetic disease is a significant health burden for patients, their families and communities. Only 5% of rare disease patients have access to a therapeutic option to treat their condition. In this study, clinical and basic biological experts at Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota will unite to address diagnostic and therapeutic challenges using preclinical models. Creating these connections can provide important insight into the genetics of disease and ultimately improve patient care.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Center for Functional Genomics of Immunotherapy (CFGI)</h3>



<p>David Largaespada, Ph.D., University of Minnesota; <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, Mayo Clinic</p>



<p>Cancer is the second leading cause of disease-associated death in the U.S. The National Cancer Institute estimates that the economic burden of cancer is $21 billion per year. The most used cancer treatments are associated with significant morbidity. Adoptive T-cell therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy, are tailored to specific cases, locations and types of cancer and have the potential to dramatically revolutionize cancer therapy. This project will contribute to the evolution of this young field by providing and testing new T-cell products that could be widely deployed and that are based on donor, genetically modified T cells that could be stored for later use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo-University of Minnesota Research Partnership</h3>



<p>Anne Murray, M.D., University of Minnesota; <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/knopman-david-s-m-d/bio-00027879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Knopman, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic</p>



<p>The risk of dementia is twice as high in older Black people compared to White non-Hispanic people. The high rates of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes in the Black population may play a role. This project will establish a new, large cohort of Black, Twin Cities residents for a study of risk factors for dementia in U.S.-born older Black people, called the “Healthy Aging in the Senior Years (HATS) Study: Cardiovascular Contributions to Brain." HATS will be a long-term, observational study to assess thinking and memory, physical function and general health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organoid Biomanufacturing for Transforming Healthcare</h3>



<p>Brenda Ogle, Ph.D., University of Minnesota; <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/howe-charles-l-ph-d/bio-00083834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Howe, Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic</p>



<p>Organoid models provide a human-centric approach to studying diseases and have the potential to speed up the discovery of treatments. In this study, researchers will create agile, reproducible and physiologically relevant models (organoids) of human hearts, brains and intestines which can be used as tools for understanding diseases, testing new treatments and even replacing damaged cells in patients. The scalable production of organoids for “off-the-shelf” use has the potential to revolutionize how to treat serious conditions like heart damage, dementia, epilepsy and cancer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Towards a Center for Advanced Synucleinopathy Diagnostics (ASCEND): Development and optimization of nanoparticle-enhanced seed amplification assays for blood-based detection of synucleinopathies</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/singer-wolfgang-m-d/bio-20538100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolfgang Singer, M.D.,</a> Mayo Clinic; Sang-Hyun Oh, Ph.D., University of Minnesota</p>



<p>In the U.S. alone, close to 1 million people live with Parkinson’s disease (PD), and globally, the number is estimated at over 10 million. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a related, much rarer neurodegenerative disease that is rapidly progressive and universally fatal. These diseases take a toll on patients' lives and place a significant financial burden on health care systems, yet can be difficult to diagnose, particularly at early disease stages. This project aims to develop accurate and cost-effective blood-based diagnostic tests for the early diagnosis of PD and MSA. This partnership could revolutionize the way we diagnose these diseases, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients, significant health care savings and a brighter future for those at risk of MSA and PD.</p>

<p>In 2017, Cindy Sutherland caught a nasty cold she couldn't shake. After coughing nonstop for weeks, she went to urgent care and got a chest X-ray. When the doctor shared the results with her, he asked, "Have you ever heard of pulmonary fibrosis?" Cindy started to cry because she knew what those words meant. Her grandmother had died of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary fibrosis</a> at the age of 62. Her mother had died of it at 58, and her sister at 48.</p>

<p>The progressive lung disease can be traced to a variety of causes — autoimmune conditions, radiation treatments, specific medications or chemotherapeutic agents, toxins like asbestos or coal dust and environmental factors like mold. Recently, researchers have begun to recognize that a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33935155/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subset of cases can be attributed to genetics</a>. Some patients with pulmonary fibrosis have shortened telomeres, the caps on the ends of chromosomes that protect cells from aging. Identifying these patients is critical because, in their case, certain treatments like immunosuppressive therapies could be dangerous.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>"I think it is way more frequent than we realize," says Sutherland’s pulmonologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/carmona-porquera-eva-m-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eva Carmona Porquera, M.D., Ph.D.</a> She is part of a large, multidisciplinary team at Mayo Clinic developing new ways to detect and treat pulmonary fibrosis cases caused by shortened telomeres.</p>



<p>"This is new territory," says Dr. Carmona Porquera. "The good thing is that at Mayo, we can offer genetic testing and telomere testing to our patients to classify, treat and prepare for complications associated with telomere biology disorders."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A rare and complex disorder</strong></h2>



<p>Telomere biology disorders are rare diseases caused by mutations that accelerate telomere shortening. Patients with these disorders are susceptible to a variety of age-related conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, bone marrow failure, osteoporosis, cancer and liver fibrosis. Many but not all patients show outward signs of premature aging, such as premature graying of hair or brittle nails. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Patnaik_Mrinal_S-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379091" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Patnaik_Mrinal_S-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Patnaik_Mrinal_S.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mrinal Patnaik, M.B.B.S.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Hematologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/patnaik-mrinal-s-m-b-b-s/bio-00093620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mrinal Patnaik, M.B.B.S</a>., first encountered these disorders as a medical resident in the early 2000s. A patient in his thirties with completely gray hair had shown up with a malignant tumor at the head and neck cancer clinic where Dr. Patnaik was training. Doctors there did not realize he had a telomere biology disorder. The patient died a month later from complete bone marrow failure.</p>



<p>"That really hurt me deep down," says Dr. Patnaik. "I felt that there's so many of these patients who are going to be coming into different clinics and if I didn't step up and set up a program for them and educate all my colleagues and set up the infrastructure, we're going to see a lot more patients suffer."&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the help of the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, Dr. Patnaik established the Telomere Biology Disorders Clinic at the Rochester, Minnesota, campus in 2017. The clinic is multidisciplinary in nature, drawing expertise from hematologists, oncologists, pulmonologists, liver specialists, pharmacists, molecular biologists and genetic counselors. To date, the clinic has seen more than 100 patients with shortened telomeres.</p>



<p>"We are among the largest adult telomere biology disorder clinics in the country," says Dr. Patnaik, who plans to open similar clinics in Arizona and Florida.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No perfect way</strong></h2>



<p>The most frequent manifestation of a telomere biology disorder is pulmonary fibrosis, the scarring of lung tissue that can make it difficult to breathe. As telomeres become shorter and shorter, the chromosomes they are designed to protect can unravel and fray, like a shoelace that has lost its protective cap. Eventually, the telomeres become so short that cells stop dividing — a process known as senescence. Those senescent cells send off a slew of chemicals that act as flares, triggering inflammatory changes that damage and thicken the lungs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers hope that by diagnosing and treating the disease earlier, they can improve outcomes for patients.</p>

<p>Telomere biology disorders are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29976374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typically diagnosed</a> by looking for shortened telomeres and testing for genetic mutations. "There are different techniques that have been developed over time to measure telomere length, and each one has pros and cons," says molecular biologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ferrer-alejandro-ph-d/bio-20503546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.</a> "Basically, there's no perfect way to do this."</p>



<p>One of the most common methods for measuring telomeres involves a technique known as Flow FISH, in which each telomere is labeled with a fluorescent marker and then fed into a machine that quantifies the average amount of fluorescence across all the telomeres on all the chromosomes in the cell. Other techniques involve sequencing to count the repetitive run of bases, TTAGGG, that makes up each telomere, again averaging the result.</p>



<p>"However, it's well-known in the field that it's not that all telomeres get shorter at the same time; it can be just one or two telomeres falling below a certain threshold that can cause disease," says Dr. Ferrer. "If you rely on a technique that uses the average, you could miss those cases."</p>



<p>Dr. Ferrer and collaborators within and outside Mayo Clinic devised a specialized sequencing technique called Telogator to assess the shortest telomere length of each chromosome.</p>



<p>"This test could have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value," says Dr. Patnaik.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Answers, finally</strong></h2>



<p>Even with the limitations of the current tests, the Telomere Biology Clinic is making a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=29804726&amp;query_hl=11&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive impact</a> on patients. Sutherland first visited the clinic in 2020 and learned that, on average, her telomere lengths fell below the first percentile. "Dr. Patnaik said they were the shortest telomeres he had ever seen," she recalls. Genetic testing revealed Sutherland had a mutation in the TERT gene, which codes for a protein called telomerase that is responsible for telomere maintenance.</p>



<p>The Mayo team estimates that they have identified a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33203829/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disease-causing variant in a telomere-associated gene</a> in only 40% of patients. In many cases, they have discovered genetic changes that may or may not cause disease — called variants of unknown significance — and have conducted functional studies in the laboratory to categorize the effect of those variants.</p>



<p>Sutherland says she felt relieved when she learned she had a genetic mutation. "You're always looking for a reason, a cause, an explanation for why this happened. Why did my grandmother, my mother and my sister pass of this horrible disease at such a young age?"</p>



<p>But that sense of relief was quickly replaced by one of foreboding for the mother of five. "I was absolutely, positively scared to death for my children."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Telomere biology disorders are subject to a troubling type of genetic inheritance known as genetic anticipation. The disorder tends to become more severe and appear at an earlier age as the mutation — and the shortened telomeres — are passed from one generation to the next. As a result, Sutherland worried not only that she had passed the condition on to her children, but also that they might inherit a form of the disease much worse than what she herself has experienced.</p>



<p>"These findings have repercussions for family members," says Dr. Carmona Porquera. "We can counsel patients: no smoking, no exposures that can cause more injury, be aware of certain symptoms. And we can start treating them earlier with anti-fibrotic drugs, which could slow the progression of the disease."</p>



<p>Sutherland has been taking anti-fibrotic drugs for the last six years. Though she often feels short of breath, at age 65, she still has the energy to babysit her grandchildren.</p>



<p>Recently, genetic testing revealed no inherited mutations in her family tree.</p>



<p>"Maybe this horrible disease will stop with me," she says. "That would be my greatest wish."</p>
