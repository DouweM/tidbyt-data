<p>Uterine cancer is the most common type of gynecologic cancer. It's estimated that about 67,880 new cases will be diagnosed in 2024. Approximately 13,250 people will die from this disease in the U.S. in 2024, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/corp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2792010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Researchers recently reported</a>&nbsp;that while death rates for the most common type of uterine cancer — endometrioid cancer — remained stable, deaths from rare and aggressive types of uterine cancer increased significantly each year from 2010 to 2017. The study also revealed a disproportionate increase in uterine cancer deaths among the Hispanic, Black and Asian communities.</p>



<p>Although uterine cancer can't be fully prevented, and there is no standard screening for it, an annual pelvic examination is recommended.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/butler-kristina-a-m-d-m-s/bio-20110364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristina Butler, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gynecologic oncologist, explains what you need to know to stay vigilant and reduce your risk:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understand uterine cancer types and how they develop.</h2>



<p>Like other cancers, uterine cancer can develop when mutations happen in the DNA cells of your uterus and endometrium, also called the endometrial lining. Sometimes, these mutations can turn normal, healthy cells into abnormal cells that grow and multiply uncontrollably and invade nearby tissues.</p>



<p>When this happens, two main types of cancer can develop:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Endometrial cancer</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endometrial cancer</a>&nbsp;starts in the endometrium. This is the most common type of uterine cancer, and it can often be cured when detected early. Endometrioid cancer is a type of endometrial cancer that starts in gland cells.</li>



<li><strong>Uterine sarcoma</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leiomyosarcoma/cdc-20387733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uterine sarcoma</a>&nbsp;starts in the muscles and supporting tissues of the uterus. It is much less common but usually more aggressive.</li>
</ul>



<p>Both types of uterine cancer also have more aggressive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrial-cancer/about/what-is-endometrial-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subtypes</a>.</p>



<p>Changes in the balance of hormones also can be a risk factor for uterine cancer.</p>



<p>Estrogen and progesterone regulate changes in the endometrium that are part of the monthly menstrual cycle. When estrogen increases but progesterone does not, the risk of endometrial cancer can increase. This can occur with obesity because fat cells increase estrogen without progesterone, which functions to keep the uterus cancer-free.</p>



<p>Certain medications and conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome and obesity, or changes such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a>, also can affect your estrogen levels.</p>



<p>"With age, menopause quiets the uterus, but that's when we notice the increased incidence of uterine cancer because abnormal mutations can happen," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Watch for abnormal vaginal bleeding and other symptoms.</h2>



<p>Dr. Butler says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/vaginal-bleeding/basics/definition/sym-20050756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abnormal vaginal bleeding</a>&nbsp;can be a sign of uterine cancer. If you've gone through menopause and no longer have a monthly menstrual cycle, any amount of blood is considered abnormal. "If you have any bleeding after menopause, it's so important to get checked out quickly," she adds.</p>



<p>For younger people who haven't gone through menopause, abnormal bleeding can include bleeding between your menstrual cycles or after sex, and prolonged or heavy bleeding.</p>



<p>Though in many cases abnormal bleeding can be attributed to noncancerous conditions, it's best to talk to your health care professional if you notice changes in your cycle that are out of the ordinary for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Improve your lifestyle choices.</h2>



<p>You can reduce some of the known risks of uterine cancer by improving your diet, exercising and maintaining a healthy weight.</p>



<p>"We are seeing a rise in diagnoses of uterine cancer, and we think this is because there's also a rise in other conditions and diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/womens-wellness-obesity-increases-endometrial-cancer-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Obesity</a>&nbsp;increases your risk of uterine cancer because extra weight can affect your menstrual cycle.</p>



<p>"In younger obese people, menses may not occur regularly, which allows thickening, and cancer can develop," she says.</p>



<p>If you need support in reaching your health goals, be sure to talk to your health care professional about support and resources that might be available to you, and learn about how a healthy diet can help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/how-plant-based-food-helps-fight-cancer/art-20457590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduce cancer risk</a>. Also, taking a birth control pill can lower the risk of uterine cancer by 50%.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Discuss your risk factors with a health care professional you trust.</h2>



<p>Awareness of your risk factors for uterine cancer can help you and your health care professional stay ahead of this type of cancer. Although factors like age, family history and certain health conditions might not be in your control, they can help your health care professional decide if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testing for uterine cancer</a>&nbsp;is right for you.</p>



<p>If they apply to you, consider discussing these risk factors with your health care professional:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You have inherited conditions linked to higher cancer risk.</li>



<li>You have an excessive amount of body fat.</li>



<li>You started menstruation before the age of 12.</li>



<li>You went through menopause later in life.</li>



<li>You have never been pregnant.</li>



<li>You've had radiation therapy to the pelvis for cancer.</li>



<li>You've had estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy after menopause.</li>



<li>You've taken the drug tamoxifen for breast cancer.</li>
</ul>



<p>Though endometrial cancer isn't usually an inherited disease, familial conditions like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>&nbsp;can increase your risk of developing it. If you don't know your family history, consider talking to a&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/08/03/dear-mayo-clinic-what-is-the-benefit-of-visiting-a-genetic-counselor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic counselor</a>&nbsp;to learn more about your personal risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Butler says it's also important to find a health care professional you trust who makes you feel heard.</p>



<p>"Finding someone you feel comfortable with is key because you have to have open communication," she says. "You should feel safe talking with them and having those intimate discussions."</p>



<p>If you are diagnosed with uterine cancer, Dr. Butler says you should try to seek care from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers</a>.</p>



<p>"We know that people have improved outcomes when they go to these centers, because they follow guidelines and provide the best evidence-based care for women," she says.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>As cancer experts work to learn more about uterine cancer and better screening, Dr. Butler says the most important thing you can do is stay up to date on your annual screenings, listen to your body and advocate for yourself if something isn't normal.</p>



<p>When it comes to abnormal bleeding, her advice is straightforward: "Don't ignore it. It can be the first sign that something abnormal is happening and can help us detect uterine cancer early."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learn more</h2>

<p>Breast cancer receives much attention during October's awareness month. Although sightings of pink ribbons and breast cancer-related information increase during the month, it's crucial to keep screenings and clinical breast exams at the forefront of preventive care year-round.</p>



<p>A Mayo Clinic Health System high-risk breast consultant and breast cancer awareness advocate shares the top&nbsp;10 questions about breast cancer asked by people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Why do I need to worry about breast cancer and having routine mammograms?</strong><br>This is the most common question shared during breast clinic consultations. Many people mention that they don't have any family history of breast cancer. However, approximately just 20% of breast cancer is related to family history and genetic links. People are considered at the highest risk after a breast cancer diagnosis in a first-degree relative, such as a mom or sister.</li>



<li><strong>What can I do to prevent breast cancer from developing?</strong><br>For most people, the answer is to live a healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, minimizing alcohol consumption and maintaining an ideal body weight through diet and exercise. The majority of the risk for breast cancer comes from being female, having breasts and aging.</li>



<li><strong>What steps can I take to be informed of my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>This answer has two parts. The first part is to learn about your family's medical history. The second part is to follow your healthcare team's recommended preventive screening plan, including a mammogram if necessary.</li>



<li><strong>Should I continue doing self-checks of my breasts and have an annual clinical breast exam?</strong><br>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Preventive Services Taskforce update breast screening recommendations annually, but more research studies need to be done. Your health history and conversations with your healthcare team will help inform the best approach for you. Although not all healthcare professionals perform a yearly clinical breast exam as part of an annual physical, you may choose to perform monthly or quarterly self-checks to increase your breast awareness. Both a yearly breast exam by a medical professional and regular self-checks are recommended if you have a higher risk of breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>What does it mean to have dense breasts, and how does that affect mammograms?</strong><br>Approximately 30% of people have moderately dense breasts and up to 10% have extremely dense breasts. While dense breast tissue does affect the detection of breast cancer through mammography, a mammogram is still a recommended annual screening starting at age 40 for people with average breast cancer risk.</li>



<li><strong>Does taking a birth control pill increase my risk of developing breast cancer?<br></strong>No strong connection has been identified to suggest any such connection in average-risk patients during childbearing years. However, studies suggest that continuing hormone therapy after age 60 can increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Does pregnancy and breastfeeding increase my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>No, it's quite the opposite. The risk of developing breast cancer decreases based on the duration of time spent pregnant and breastfeeding.</li>



<li><strong>How do environmental toxin exposure and radiation affect breast cancer?<br></strong>Certain factors, such as radiation exposure from previous cancer treatment, working in an environment with toxins, or other radiation exposure can increase your risk of many cancer types, including breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Should I have genetic testing to determine if I have a family-related risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>The short answer is, for some people, yes. However, genetic testing is recommended only after a discussion with your healthcare team or breast specialist about your cancer risks. You may be asked to meet with a genetics counselor to ensure that there is a strong indication for testing.</li>



<li><strong>Does my race affect my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>The answer to this question is complex. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African Americans, American Indians, Pacific Islanders and Alaskan Native Americans have a much higher rate of breast cancer and breast cancer-related mortality. However, there are many nuances to this concerning medical equity, racial disparity and other considerations that need to be explored and addressed.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you have been identified as having a higher risk of breast cancer and referred to a high-risk breast clinic, you can expect a comprehensive meeting with a healthcare professional who is skilled and passionate about breast cancer prevention and survivorship.</p>

<p>"There are only two surgical options: lumpectomy and mastectomy. But there are 100 reasons why women choose one thing or another," says Dr. McLaughlin.  "Some of that can be cancer-based, some of it can be family history and genetic, some of it can be personal peace of mind."</p>

<p>"If you don't need a mastectomy, you don't do better or live longer because you do a more radical operation," says Dr. McLaughlin.</p>



<p>Surgical innovations are improving care and quality of life. Some patients no longer need lymph nodes under the armpit removed, and new techniques remove less skin while preserving the nipple and areola complex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"That means placing the incisions remote from the actual site of cancer and then rearranging the breast tissue within what remains," says Dr. McLaughlin.</p>



<p>It's important to work with your healthcare team to determine what treatments are best for you. Considerations may include the stage of cancer, your personal preferences and overall health.</p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. ― Since the 1970s, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammograms</a> have been shown to reduce the risk of dying of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> and have saved countless lives.</p>



<p>"In the decades since early mammography was established, the emergence of new screening options go well beyond traditional mammography and have made great advancements in early detection," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/tara-krosch-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tara Krosch, M.D.</a>, regional vice chair of clinical practice for surgical specialties, Mayo Clinic Health System in Southwest Minnesota. "As we all know, early detection is key to the best patient outcomes, so it's vital that patients get their annual screenings."</p>



<p>In recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a> is encouraging people to talk to their healthcare team about the right screening options for them and to get those screenings scheduled. Here's what you need to know about the most common options and which might be best for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mammogram</strong></h2>



<p>A mammogram is an X-ray image of your breasts used for diagnostic purposes, as well as to investigate symptoms or unusual findings on another type of imaging test.</p>



<p>During a mammogram, your breasts are compressed between two firm surfaces to spread the breast tissue. Then an X-ray captures black-and-white images that are displayed on a computer screen and examined by a radiologist for signs of cancer. A traditional mammogram creates two-dimensional images of the breast.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic Health System, healthcare teams offer screening&nbsp;mammography, beginning at 40, for women at average risk of breast cancer.&nbsp;Average risk of breast cancer&nbsp;means women with no family history of breast cancer and no other risk factors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital breast tomosynthesis</strong></h2>



<p>This screening exam, also known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/3d-mammogram/about/pac-20438708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3D mammography</a>, has become a best practice in women's health for breast cancer-detecting technology. Breast tomosynthesis differs from traditional mammograms in how the image of the breast is obtained and, more importantly, viewed.</p>



<p>"Much like a traditional mammogram, a woman's breasts are compressed between two firm surfaces to spread the tissue, and a digital tomographic image is created, which a radiologist can view and closely examine," says Dr. Krosch. "The 3D mammograms help detect small calcifications, masses and other changes that may be signs of early cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Molecular breast imaging</strong></h2>



<p>This procedure uses a radioactive tracer and a special camera to take pictures of the breast tissue.</p>



<p>During the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/molecular-breast-imaging/about/pac-20394710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">molecular breast imaging</a> (MBI) exam, a small amount of radioactive tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer travels through your blood to your breast tissue. Cells growing quickly take up more of the tracer than slowly growing cells. Cancer cells often grow quickly and can be identified if they are taking up more of the tracer.</p>



<p>A special camera, called a gamma camera, detects the radiation released by the tracer. In the pictures made by the gamma camera, the cells that take up more of the tracer look brighter than the surrounding cells.</p>



<p>MBI provides the greatest benefit for women with&nbsp;dense breasts&nbsp;or intermediate breast cancer risk. As the density of breast tissue increases, the ability to detect breast cancer with screening mammography becomes more challenging. It's important to know that MBI does not replace, but is used in addition to, screening mammography for early breast cancer detection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Breast MRI</strong></h2>



<p>Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast, also called a breast MRI, is used to evaluate breast cancer or to help healthcare teams determine the causes of other problems in the breast. A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-mri/about/pac-20384809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast MRI</a> also is recommended as a screening exam for women with an elevated lifetime risk of breast cancer, such as a strong family history of breast cancer, genetic risk or other factors.</p>



<p>A breast MRI uses powerful magnets, radiofrequency detectors and a computer to create high-detail images of the breasts. A breast MRI may be done after a biopsy shows cancer, as a screening exam or possibly to further investigate a breast finding. A breast MRI also can evaluate the extent of any cancer, as well as evaluate the other breast.</p>



<p>A breast MRI may be used with mammography as a screening tool for detecting breast cancer in some people. This includes people with a high risk of breast cancer. It also includes people with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast cancer gene changes passed down through the family, called an inherited gene.</p>



<p>"We encourage all women to talk with their healthcare teams about their personal risks for breast cancer, as well as the benefits and risks of each screening option," says Dr. Krosch. "We have a high-risk clinic right here in our Mankato Breast Clinic to help. For some, this helps to determine your best next steps in surveillance and ongoing options. Lastly, always be sure to bring the breast concerns you pick up on to your healthcare team."</p>

<p>The following press release was distributed by the <a href="https://www.astro.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)</a></p>



<p><em>Phase 2 clinical trial finds <sup>177</sup>Lu-Dotatate may extend progression-free survival for patients with no other options to manage recurrent disease</em></p>



<p>WASHINGTON — A radiopharmaceutical therapy that has successfully extended progression-free survival for patients with neuroendocrine tumors shows early signs for delivering similar benefits to patients with difficult-to-treat <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meningioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20355643#:~:text=A%20meningioma%20is%20a%20tumor%20that%20grows%20from#:~:text=A%20meningioma%20is%20a%20tumor%20that%20grows%20from" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meningioma</a>, a type of brain tumor. The nonrandomized phase 2 study's findings were presented at the <a href="http://www.astro.org/annualmeeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We've found a therapy with a meaningful signal for effectiveness and safety for people with refractory meningioma, a condition with no standard treatment options," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merrell-kenneth-w-m-d/bio-20434012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kenneth Merrell</a>, lead researcher of the trial and a radiation oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. "Nearly 80% of patients in our study were progression-free after six months. This rate greatly surpassed the benchmark from prior research, suggesting that radiopharmaceuticals are a promising therapeutic agent for these patients."</p>



<p>Meningiomas are tumors that grow in the connective tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord. They are the most common type of primary brain tumor, and while they typically do not spread to other parts of the body, they can grow uncontrollably and lead to disabling and deadly compression of the nerves and brain.</p>



<p>Standard treatment for patients with meningiomas is either surgical removal or external beam radiation therapy when tumors grow in areas where surgery is too dangerous, such as close to the brain stem or spinal cord. However, for the portion of patients where the tumor grows despite these treatments, known as refractory meningioma, the tumors tend to behave more aggressively, and retreatment is difficult because radiation and surgery cannot be repeated frequently without greater risks.</p>



<p>"There is no standard of care or proven option for managing refractory meningioma. Many of these patients continue to experience aggressive tumor growth and significant related complications, and ultimately the illness may prove fatal. It is a very challenging prognosis to manage, and in many cases, we are left with only supportive measures," says Dr. Merrell.</p>



<p>Dr. Merrell and his colleagues investigated whether patients with refractory meningioma would benefit from theranostics, an approach that combines therapy with diagnostics for personalized internal delivery of radiation treatment. Theranostics leverages radiopharmaceuticals — specialized medicine containing radioactive material — to find cancer cells in the body and attack them with precise doses of radiation, without harming the surrounding healthy tissue. This dual-pronged approach offers patients a more tailored, and potentially more effective, treatment option.</p>



<p>While still an emerging treatment modality, radiopharmaceuticals are commonly used to treat thyroid cancer, metastatic cancer such as bone metastases from prostate cancer, and other types of tumors. For this trial, researchers looked specifically at <sup>177</sup>Lu-Dotatate, an FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical for neuroendocrine tumors, which share biological similarities with meningiomas.</p>



<p>"There have been many attempts at testing a variety of chemotherapies and other systemic agents for these patients. And others have looked at this option for therapy, but no one had completed a prospective trial for this patient population before ours," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/johnson-geoffrey-b-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055408#:~:text=Top%20accruing%20Principal%20Investigator%20for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Geoffrey Johnson</a>, co-lead of the trial and a nuclear medicine physician at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "With advanced PET imaging, the theranostic approach to treatment helps us to select those patients most likely to&nbsp;benefit from molecularly targeted radiation directly to their tumor cells."</p>



<p>The researchers conducted a single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial at a large academic center, enrolling patients with refractory meningioma that had grown at a rate of 15% or more over a six-month period. During a three-year period beginning in April 2020, patients including 20 people with WHO grade 2 or 3 disease were enrolled into the study. The median patient age was 67, and nearly all (95%) had grade 2 meningiomas. Trial participants received four infusions of <sup>177</sup>Lu-Dotatate spaced eight weeks apart.</p>



<p>Six months after treatment, 78% of patients had not experienced further tumor progression, far exceeding the benchmark progression-free survival rate of 26% established by prior research. The median time before patients' cancer progressed was 11.5 months.</p>



<p>After one year, overall survival was 88.9%. No patients experienced life-threatening side effects, while 10 had severely low blood counts, one had grade 3 hepatitis and one had a grade 3 seizure possibly related to treatment. Five patients did not complete treatment due to tumor progression (n=2), adverse events possibly related to treatment (n=2) or other comorbidities (n-1).</p>



<p>"Most patients tolerated the treatment well," says Dr. Merrell. "It appears that <sup>177</sup>Lu-Dotatate is a safe and rational therapeutic choice with broad eligibility for patients with aggressively growing meningiomas, particularly as alternative therapy options are limited.</p>



<p>"As there is no current standard of care for these patients, our findings establish a new benchmark and may influence the treatment options available."</p>

<p><strong>Purpose/Objective(s): </strong>Meningioma is the most frequently encountered brain tumor and typically managed with surgery and/or radiotherapy. However, recurrence rates for WHO grade II and III meningioma are reported as high as 40-80%, respectively. With each recurrence, safe and effective salvage options are quickly exhausted, leading to signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality. As nearly all meningiomas express somatostatin receptors, we evaluated the efﬁcacy of lutetium-177 (<sup>177</sup>Lu)−Dotatate for refractory meningioma.</p>



<p><strong>Materials/Methods: </strong>This is a single-arm, phase II clinical trial conducted at a single, large academic center. Eligible patients included those with surgery- and radiation-refractory meningioma with measurable disease and ≥ 15% growth over a 6-month period. <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATATE PET/MRI was performed and a Krenning score of ≥ 2 was required. The <sup>177</sup>Lu-Dotatate was delivered at a dose of 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) every 8 weeks for a total of 4 administrations. MRI brain was performed prior to each administration. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6). Exceeding the established RANO historical benchmark of 26% for PFS-6 signaled a promising therapy. Secondary endpoints include PFS, overall survival (OS), and rates of adverse events (AEs) at least possibly related to the investigational agent. A separate WHO grade I cohort continues to enroll.</p>



<p><strong>Results:</strong> From April 2020 to April 2023, 26 patients were screened and 20 met all eligibility requirements and were enrolled into the WHO grade II/ III cohort. The median age was 66.8 years (range = 38.9-85.0) and 95% had WHO grade II meningioma. ECOG PS was 0, 1, and 2 in 55%, 35%, and 10% of patients, respectively. A total of 40% of patients had a history of seizures and 65% had a history of neurologic deﬁcit related to the refractory tumor, although only 15% were receiving corticosteroids at the time of enrollment. A Krenning score of 2, 3 and 4 was observed in 45%, 45%, and 10% of patients, respectively. PFS-6 and median PFS was 77.8% (95% CI = 52-94) and 10.7 months, respectively. Median survival was not reached. 1-year OS was 88.5% (95% CI = 47-96). There was no grade 4 or 5 AE attributable to treatment. A total of 10 patients experienced grade 3 hematologic AE with two patients experiencing grade 3 hepatitis (<em>n </em>= 1) and grade 3 seizure (<em>n </em>= 1), at least possibly attributed to treatment. 5 patients did not complete all 4 administrations due to possible treatment related AE (<em>n </em>= 2), tumor progression (<em>n </em>= 2), and other comorbidities (<em>n </em>= 1).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This phase II clinical trial met the primary endpoint of PFS-6 and represents a signiﬁcant milestone for surgery- and radiation-refractory meningioma as one of the ﬁrst prospectively evaluated systemic agents to yield substantial clinical efﬁcacy, surpassing established clinical benchmarks with reasonable safety proﬁle. The <sup>177</sup>Lu-Dotatate PFS appears as a safe and rational therapeutic choice with broad eligibility for the patient population under study, particularly as alternative therapy options are limited.</p>

<p>An appointment with your healthcare professional can be particularly stressful when it involves sensitive or intimate concerns about your body. However, addressing these concerns early is crucial for potentially detecting or identifying serious conditions like cancer.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/butler-kristina-a-m-d-m-s/bio-20110364">Dr. Kristina Butler</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gynecologic-oncology/overview/ovc-20424080">gynecologic oncologist</a>, understands that discussing gynecological health issues can be challenging. Finding a healthcare professional you trust and coming prepared to your appointment can make all the difference in ensuring your concerns are fully addressed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some tips to help you prepare for your visit.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/N1HVV4DhKSg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: The Mayo Clinic Minute</a></strong></p>

<p>Talking about uncomfortable symptoms can feel different from showing up for a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/recommendations-to-begin-breast-cancer-screening-at-age-40/">breast cancer screening</a> or <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/toolkit-for-reducing-cervical-cancer-risk/">Pap smear</a>.</p>



<p>"It can be difficult for a woman to bring up that they have an area that is painful on their vulva. I mean, these are very difficult things to talk about, so knowing that there are providers available to talk about these intimate areas is important," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prepare for your appointment</h2>



<p>Preparing for an appointment can help focus the visit. </p>



<p>"I am a proponent of having lists — lists of medications, lists of surgeries they've had, lists of diagnoses that they have, your family history is tremendously important," she says.</p>



<p>And bring copies of any test reports from other facilities, along with your list.</p>

<p>“It's your right to have your medical records, and so I empower patients to keep those for themselves," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Butler adds that if patients feel they have unanswered questions they should consider getting a second medical opinion&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Patients have a right to receive opinions from multiple individuals and formulate the best-shared decision for themselves,” she says.</p>

<p>If you’ve been diagnosed with prostate cancer, exploring what may have contributed to your cancer might not be at the top of your list. However, learning about your family history and the genetic characteristics of your prostate cancer can help your care team zero in on the best treatment plan for you.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/childs-daniel-dan-s-m-d/bio-20536072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Childs, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist specializing in genitourinary cancers, and Joan Steyermark, a Mayo Clinic genetic counselor, explain the roles of family history and genetics in the development and treatment of prostate cancer:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Familial history vs. inherited risk</h2>



<p>About 1 in 8 people with prostates will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=About%201%20man%20in%208,rare%20in%20men%20under%2040." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. If you have a family history of prostate cancer — a first-degree relative such as a parent, a sibling or a child who has developed the disease — you may be at higher risk.</p>



<p>Though prostate cancer is considered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly heritable</a>, most people who develop prostate cancer don’t have a strong family history of the disease. "The majority of prostate cancers are believed to occur sporadically. By that, I mean that we haven't found a particular genetic susceptibility that's passed along within families," says Dr. Childs.</p>



<p>With today's standard testing, approximately 10% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer are found to have an inherited gene change (mutation) that raised their risk of developing the disease. However, Dr. Childs says research in this area is ongoing, and it's likely that a higher percentage of men are born with a predisposition for developing prostate cancer.</p>



<p>Unless you have genetic testing to evaluate for select cancer mutations, you won't know if you have a genetic predisposition —an inherited risk — to developing prostate cancer. Some of the genes that have been associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BRCA1, BRCA2</a>&nbsp;and HOXB13 genes.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>, a condition in which a particular set of genes doesn't work as expected, can also increase prostate cancer risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Childs encourages people to learn about their family’s cancer history and talk to their healthcare professionals about appropriate testing. "I believe information is power. If you know you're at higher risk of developing cancer, give that information to your primary care doctor. They'll tailor a cancer screening program specifically for you," says Dr. Childs. This could mean monitoring your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/psa-test/about/pac-20384731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSA</a>&nbsp;levels more closely or starting screening at a younger age.</p>



<p>Knowing your family’s cancer history and information obtained from your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/genetic-testing/about/pac-20384827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic testing</a>&nbsp;can also be important for other family members who may also want to do their own screening tests based on your results. "If a patient has a genetic change, that means their children or siblings might also have the same change. Identifying it may lead to cascade testing in family members, allowing them to find cancers before they spread," says Dr. Childs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mutations and your treatment plan</h2>



<p>Some genetic mutations respond better to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted drugs</a>&nbsp;and specific treatments. If you've been diagnosed with high-risk or metastatic prostate cancer, your healthcare professional might recommend genetic testing for you.</p>



<p>Dr. Childs says specific characteristics in a patient and their cancer can indicate the need for genetic testing. "Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer at particularly young ages or with aggressive forms of prostate cancer are much more likely to have a hereditary contributor," he says.</p>



<p>As cancer experts learn more about prostate cancer, they develop more precise, effective treatments. "We don't take a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment. We use the genetic characteristics, scans and markers on the surface of the cancer cells to direct the right treatment to the right patient," says Dr. Childs. "Many new medications are being studied in clinical trials, but there are also treatments already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/parp-inhibitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PARP inhibitors</a>, which may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. We already use genetic testing to help us understand which patients are most likely to benefit from PARP inhibitors."</p>



<p>Genetic testing also can help your care team understand if you may be susceptible to other cancers. "If somebody with prostate cancer has a hereditary gene mutation that's driving their cancer, we may find out they have additional cancer risks," says Steyermark. "They may need increased screening and surveillance for other types of cancer. This can impact their future health and that of their family."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meeting with a genetic counselor</h2>



<p>Before getting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/genetic-testing/about/pac-20384827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic testing</a>, Dr. Childs and Steyermark recommend meeting with a genetic counselor who can help you understand what to expect from the process.</p>



<p>When you meet with a genetic counselor, the first step will be recording your known&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2021/12/22/gather-your-family-health-history-this-holiday-season-it-could-save-your-life/">family history of cancer</a>, says Steyermark. "We usually spend about 30 minutes building a family tree. And we ask many questions — about grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, parents and children — and focus on cancers in the family and ages of onset of those cancers," she says.</p>



<p>Next, Steyermark says she likes to give patients an overview of genetics. Once patients understand the basics, she explains how genetic testing works, the benefits and limitations, and the significance of the results.</p>



<p>Some of the concerns Steyermark hears from patients include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The emotional burden of test results.</li>



<li>Sharing test results with family.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Genetic-Discrimination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genetic discrimination</a> and privacy concerns regarding their results.</li>



<li>Costs associated with testing and <a href="https://www.facingourrisk.org/support/insurance-paying-for-care/genetic-services/private-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insurance coverage</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>A genetic counselor can help you think through and address these concerns and identify solutions.</p>



<p>"I think any genetic test result is powerful and can transform somebody's healthcare," says Steyermark. "Having a genetic counselor involved and sharing your genetic test information with your healthcare team can ensure that the results are used to their full potential."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learn more</h2>

<p><a id="_msocom_1"></a>As the sun rises above the St. Johns River and casts a glow on the glass buildings of downtown Jacksonville, Florida, Ann Mackey returns from a walk with her dog Maggie and prepares to attend a book club discussion. It's moments like these she has come to truly appreciate after treatment for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>.</p>

<p>"I have always said you have to know when to be happy, and for me right now, this is a time to be happy," says Ann.</p>



<p>In the 1990s, her career brought her to Jacksonville, Florida, and it wasn't long before she felt connected to the community. Between corporate work, Ann found opportunities to volunteer, make friends and immerse herself in history, culture and literature. In 1994, she sought care at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>"Ann has been a patient at Mayo Clinic for more than 25 years," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ailawadhi-sikander-m-d/bio-20087330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sikander Ailawadhi</a>, a Mayo Clinic hematologist and oncologist. "While it was initially taking care of her primary care needs&nbsp;through family medicine to getting diagnosed with multiple myeloma, receiving many, many treatments and having a diagnosis of breast cancer, getting treatment for that, then having progression of myeloma and going through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/gnc-20405215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy</a>."</p>



<p>The treatments have evolved much like the surroundings where she attends appointments.</p>



<p>"I feel like I watched Mayo Clinic grow because the first time I came here, there was a single building on campus, and everyone I saw was extraordinary," says Ann. "I've always felt like the physicians knew me. They knew me as Ann, and I was amazed that there was that level of connection with physicians at Mayo. As my needs over the years happened, the Mayo team, the Mayo staff, and the Mayo buildings have still been growing."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-393651" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-768x511.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-2048x1364.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ann Mackey visits Butchart Gardens near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ann was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer on three separate occasions. When a fellow working with her physician noticed an abnormality in her lab results, they investigated further, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of multiple myeloma.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We are being able to see over our lifetimes how the management of patients is being transformed," says Dr. Ailawadhi. "It's that effort to keep trying to put our heads together and making sure that the needs of the patient are getting served, not just today, but tomorrow. And that kind of thought process of mapping the patient's journey and walking that journey with the patient, hand in hand, helps us come up with stories like Ann's, where over more than 25 years, we have been able to find answers for her."</p>



<p>Ann's care led her to join a multiple myeloma support group, which she now co-leads from the same building where she received treatment. The group offers comfort to those in treatment and remission as well as connection to subject matter experts to explain advances in multiple myeloma care.</p>



<p>"That sort of relentless curiosity, that drive to figure out what it is, what's going on — I think that saved my life," says Ann. "I had my CAR-T therapy in June of 2022, and since then, I have had no treatment. I'm cancer-free. It's undetectable now, so I'm very happy I get to keep enjoying life. It's amazing." </p>



<p>Not only is Ann involved in restoring a Jacksonville landmark, Memorial Park, but she is also looking forward to new travel adventures and opportunities in retirement.<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>

<p>"Lymphoma in plain terms is essentially a cancer of your immune system," says Dr. Iqbal.</p>



<p>Patients who are newly diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352638?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymphoma</a> are offered a combination of chemotherapy and antibody-based treatments. But for those who do not respond to two or more lines of such treatments, CAR-T cell therapy may be an option.</p>



<p>"Prior to the advent of CAR-T cell therapy, patients who had failed two lines of chemotherapy had a very poor survival of around six months," says Dr. Iqbal.</p>



<p>Receiving CAR-T cell therapy can take a few weeks as a patient's T cells, which normally help fight off infections, are collected and genetically engineered to target lymphoma.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After low-dose chemotherapy, the modified cells are infused back into the patient. These cells can then attack and destroy the lymphoma.</p>



<p>"Patients who had a very poor prognosis can now potentially be cured of their disease," says Dr. Iqbal.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My 32-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. It's a lot to take in. We've heard about treatment-free remission. That sounds hopeful. What does that mean? How is it achieved?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> It is a lot to take in. Some background information may help you and your daughter understand this diagnosis and potential treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leukemias</a> are cancers of the blood cells. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chronic myelogenous leukemia</a> (CML) is an uncommon type of cancer of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-biopsy/about/pac-20393117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow</a>, which produces blood cells. "Myelogenous" refers to the type of blood cells this leukemia affects. "Chronic" means this cancer is more slowly progressing than other severe forms of leukemia.</p>



<p>CML is a genetic problem that causes overproduction of a protein that allows some blood cells to grow out of control. But the gene change that causes CML is not hereditary. Parents do not pass the gene to their children.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/chronic-myeloid-leukemia/about/statistics.html#:~:text=The%20American%20Cancer%20Society's%20estimates,780%20men%20and%20530%20women)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>, nearly 9,000 people are diagnosed with CML each year in the U.S. This type of leukemia typically affects older adult males, but both men and women can be diagnosed with CML. It is rarely seen in children.</p>



<p>Some people with CML may experience symptoms such as bone pain, bleeding easily and feeling full after eating a small amount. But many people do not have symptoms until later stages. It is diagnosed with a blood test.</p>



<p>People first diagnosed with CML likely will begin targeted treatment to eliminate blood cells that are overproducing a protein called tyrosine kinase. Medications called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are first-line treatments. Each medication has its own side effects, such as swelling or nausea, that differ for each patient and are discussed in the early stages of choosing treatment. At later stages, other treatments may include chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant.</p>



<p>Patients we consider for treatment-free remission include those in a low-risk category who take one kind of medication during their treatment course and are in what's called "molecular remission" for at least two years. Molecular remission means the gene that causes CML cannot be found in the patient's blood or bone marrow.</p>



<p>During and after treatment, regular tests are necessary to monitor the patient's blood. When no leukemia is detected, patients may be able to end treatment. Even patients in treatment-free remission must be monitored regularly, for life, and work closely with a hematologist or oncologist. That means testing monthly, progressing to every other month, then every three months, to every six months.</p>



<p>If a patient were to relapse, the disease would be discovered early, and treatment using the same kind of medication would be resumed. Studies over the last 10 to 15 years have shown when restarting medication early, the chance of achieving remission is almost 100%.</p>



<p>There are certain criteria before stopping TKI treatments. This is important as it affects women and family planning. Managing CML, pregnancy and childbirth is challenging but possible with the help of the healthcare team.</p>



<p>At Mayo, we started this treatment-free remission approach in 2015. Many patients have been off treatment for years.
