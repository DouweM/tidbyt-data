<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/how-extreme-heat-and-humidity-affect-your-health/">How extreme heat and humidity affect your health</a></h2>



<p>Oppressive heat and humidity can prevent the body from cooling down, increasing the risk of heat cramps, exhaustion and heatstroke. Seeking care promptly for heat-related illnesses is crucial. You should try to cool down quickly, drink cool fluids and stay out of the heat until your symptoms get better. ⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-can-music-help-someone-with-alzheimers-disease/">Can music help someone with Alzheimer's disease?</a></h2>



<p>Musical memories often are preserved in Alzheimer's disease because key brain areas linked to musical memory are relatively undamaged by the disease. Research suggests that listening to or singing songs can provide emotional and behavioral benefits for people with Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-does-expired-sunscreen-still-work/">Does expired sunscreen still work?</a></h2>



<p>One way to protect your skin from the sun is to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor, or SPF, of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Before you reach for that old bottle of sunscreen, find out if the expiration date really matters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/dengue-fever-a-mayo-clinic-expert-explains-the-mosquito-borne-infection/">Mayo Clinic expert discusses dengue fever amid CDC warning of increased risk</a></h2>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning of an increased risk of dengue fever in the U.S. Dengue fever is a potentially life-threatening viral infection transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ready-to-run-mayo-physician-and-runner-suggests-ways-to-beat-the-heat-while-running-this-spring/">Mayo physician and runner suggests ways to beat the heat while running</a></h2>



<p>When summer goes from warm to hot, exercising could become risky — unless you're prepared. The trick is to be smart about it. By following some simple tips, you'll get more out of your time outdoors and reduce the risks associated with hot weather.</p>

<p>Dealing with chronic conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be challenging and sometimes embarrassing. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-inflammatory-bowel-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</a> can cause diarrhea, stomach pain, weight loss and other symptoms. Also, the intersectionality of LGBTQ+ identity and having a chronic illness like IBD can sometimes make it difficult for patients to discuss their symptoms with healthcare professionals.</p>



<p>In July 2022, Mayo Clinic was one of the first in the nation to open an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/vid-20555152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBD Pride Clinic</a>. The clinic aims to create an affirming space for LGBTQ+ patients to talk about their specific healthcare concerns.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/ani-2-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389743" style="width:717px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/ani-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/ani-2-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/ani-2-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/ani-2-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> IBD patient Ani Roy in the early years of his diagnosis</figcaption></figure>



<p>Twenty-seven-year-old Ani Roy, a patient, Mayo Clinic staff member and transmasculine nonbinary person, says the IBD Pride Clinic is a place of comfort.</p>



<p>Ani doesn't take eating for granted. They were diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2017 after experiencing painful stomach aches and, at times, being unable to eat.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It was difficult to digest foods</strong></h3>



<p>"The only thing that I was really able to eat was chicken strips and raspberry iced tea. For some reason, those were the only things that didn't make me want to vomit," explains Ani.</p>



<p>Inflammatory bowel disease took a toll on Ani's body, causing frequent trips to the toilet with bloody diarrhea and other symptoms.</p>



<p>"It got to the point where I was starting to pass out," they say. "I was shaking and just, like, sweating, feeling very faint and wasn't really able to function as a human being."</p>



<p>After several hospitalizations and failed medications, Ani had their colon and rectum removed, leaving them with an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/ostomy/art-20045825">ileostomy</a>. The surgical procedure creates an opening in the stomach to divert stool. Waste is collected in an ostomy bag that's attached to the abdomen," says Ani.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crohn's disease is mentally and physically challenging</strong></h3>



<p>"It is a very big mental adjustment," they say.</p>



<p>With the stigma surrounding the ileostomy and their gender identity and sexual orientation, Ani reached out to the Mayo Clinic IBD Pride Clinic for support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389699" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Patient Ani Roy talks with Dr. Victor Chedid.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"Many LGBTQ+ patients suffer in silence," says Victor Chedid, M.D., director of the Mayo Clinic IBD Pride Clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"They might be struggling with their identity internally. And add to it the fact that you're struggling with your diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, that has a double or additional psychological impact on you," says Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>"It's so nice to go to a provider that is informed about the LGBTQ+ community so that I don't feel like I have to educate them on that part of me. I can just be that part of me," says Ani.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healing and Hope</strong></h3>



<p>The IBD Pride Clinic is staffed by healthcare professionals who are trained to be sensitive in the care of LGBTQ+ patients.</p>



<p>"This is a safe space for you to talk to us about your inflammatory bowel disease and anything that might be impacting your life," says Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ani is turning their pain into purpose, sewing ostomy bag covers for themselves and others. Living life one day — and one stitch — at a time.</p>



<p>"Overall, I'm doing pretty well, living life as best as I can," says Ani.</p>

<p>EAU CLAIRE, Wis. ― When the weather has you enthused about fitness, the last thing you want is to be sidelined with joint pain.</p>



<p>"People might associate joint aches and pains with an older age group, but joint pain can affect people in all stages of life," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/amy-rantala-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Rantala, M.D.,</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/sports-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sports Medicine</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a>. "This can be frustrating because pain can be a barrier to maintaining regular exercise and enjoying being active in sports or other activities."</p>



<p>Preventing joint pain in the first place is the best course. A good first step if you want to join a sport or up your exercise goals is to check with your primary care provider or see a sports medicine specialist who can assess your overall fitness level, general mobility and if you have current injuries or pain.</p>



<p>They also may conduct a functional movement screening to evaluate how you move and pinpoint specific issues. For example, you may have decreased range of motion in a hip or shoulder or are stronger on one side than the other. This screening can identify specific rehabilitative exercises that can be done along with your regular exercise program. These exercises help your body move safely, perform exercises correctly, and reduce the risk for injury.</p>



<p>"When you do build an exercise program, make sure it's sustainable and incorporates cardio, strength building and flexibility," says Dr. Rantala. "Then ease your way into it. Don't go from 0 to 100 overnight because that can lead to injuries and sore joints."</p>



<p><strong>Some additional points to keep in mind:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Listen to your body. Don't overdo it. Take a break or tone down your activity for the rest of the day.</li>



<li>Keep a small problem small. If you're feeling recurring pain, get it checked out.</li>



<li>Build in time to recover between activity sessions. Our bodies need this time to rebuild and repair.</li>



<li>Work around your limitations. For example, if you have knee pain, using a reverse lunge or hex-bar squat helps reduces stress on your knees and allows you to target the same muscle groups.</li>
</ul>



<p>"If joint pain begins to restrict the activities you love, the best thing to do is consult an orthopedic or sports medicine specialist so the two of you can map out a plan for diagnosis and treatment to keep you active and enjoying your life," says Dr. Rantala. "Focus on playing the long game when it comes to sports and regular exercise by finding what works for your body long-term."</p>

<p>For many, the Fourth of July holiday is a time to celebrate with barbecues, parades and fireworks. But, experts say, when it comes to fireworks, it's best to leave it to the professionals.</p>

<p>Every year, thousands of people are admitted into emergency departments across the country because of injuries caused by fireworks.</p>



<p>"We'll see injuries to fingers or the whole hand. Another common injury is burns. And sometimes we'll see eye injuries because of the sparks that fly into the eye," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/raukar-neha-p-m-d-m-s/bio-20451153?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Neha Raukar</a>, a Mayo Clinic emergency medicine physician.</p>



<p>If consumer fireworks are legal where you live, here are a few tips from the <a href="https://www.nsc.org/home-safety/tools-resources/seasonal-safety/summer/fireworks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Safety Council</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Never allow young children to handle fireworks.</li>



<li>Always have adult supervision.</li>



<li>Wear protective eyewear.</li>



<li>Never hold lighted fireworks in your hands.</li>



<li>Don't point or throw fireworks at another person.</li>



<li>Only light one firework at a time.</li>



<li>Watch them from a safe distance.</li>
</ul>



<p>"If you're going to have some fireworks, don't be drinking at the same time. Have the person who is not drinking be the one to light the fireworks. Stay away from them once you light them, and just be aware of your surroundings," says Dr. Raukar. "I don't want to meet you here in the emergency department."</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.asp">warning</a> of an increased risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dengue-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20353078">dengue fever</a> in the U.S.</p>



<p>Dengue fever is a potentially life-threatening viral infection transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes.</p>



<p>The CDC issued a health alert, saying a higher-than-expected number of dengue fever cases have been reported in the U.S. Puerto Rico declared a health emergency with 1,498 cases reported. Among U.S. travelers, 745 cases were identified this year as of June 24.</p>



<p>The U.S. health alert comes as global outbreaks of dengue fever are on the rise, with a total of 9.7 million cases reported in Latin American countries since the beginning of 2024, more than twice the number recorded in all of 2023 (4.6 million).</p>



<p>"Four different subtypes of the virus can cause infections in humans," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rizza-stacey-a-m-d/bio-20054180?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stacey Rizza</a>, a Mayo Clinic infectious diseases specialist. "Wherever you have a significant number of mosquitoes and warm hot environments is where you see dengue transmission."</p>

<p>Approximately half of the world's population lives in areas vulnerable to dengue fever, particularly in hot and humid tropical and subtropical climates.</p>



<p>"That's why you see it in parts of the world such as Southeast Asia, South America, the Caribbean, and even some parts of the southern U.S., around Florida and Louisiana.," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>The primary transmitter of dengue fever is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, known to bite during both day and night. About 1 in 4 people infected with the virus will experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of dengue fever</h2>



<p>"They usually notice fevers, body aches, bone aches, muscle aches; many times, they even describe an aching behind their eyes. They can get some nausea, vomiting and even diarrhea," Dr. Rizza says.</p>



<p>While most people recover within about a week, severe cases can lead to life-threatening emergencies.</p>



<p>Symptoms of severe dengue fever may include:</p>



<p>• Severe stomach pain.<br>• Persistent vomiting.<br>• Bleeding from your gums or nose.<br>• Blood in your urine, stool or vomit.<br>• Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising.<br>• Difficult or rapid breathing.<br>• Fatigue.<br>• Irritability or restlessness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no medicine to treat dengue fever.</p>



<p>"There's no antiviral or no treatment for dengue fever," she says. "It's what we call supportive therapy. Maintaining good hydration, particularly as people are sick and having fevers, is important. They can use acetaminophen to take care of the fevers, bring down the temperature, and then ensure they take in fluids and still get some form of eating."</p>



<p>"If they become severely ill and aren't able to keep up with their fluid status, they should go to their hospital and may require hospitalization to help support them," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>Though there is no direct treatment, a vaccine is approved in many countries for children ages 9-16 who have previously shown evidence of dengue infection. Dr. Rizza says the vaccine is not approved in the U.S.</p>



<p>"You give it to people who have already had immunologic evidence of a previous dengue infection, and then you give it to them to help prevent them from becoming reinfected," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h2>



<p>Preventing mosquito bites is vital to avoiding dengue fever. Here are some strategies:</p>



<p>• Use bug spray with DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus to prevent mosquito bites.<br>• Remove any stagnant water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.<br>• Eliminate items that hold water, such as vases and flowerpot saucers.<br>• Ensure intact window screens and closed doors to keep mosquitoes outside.<br>• Wear protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants.</p>



<p>The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for several viral infections, including dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika.</p>

<p>"High heat and high humidity can place one at risk for serious illness if people aren't careful.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of heat-related illnesses</h2>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/safety-tips-to-prevent-heat-related-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heat-related illnesses</a> can be serious. They include heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke.</p>



<p>"Illness can be something mild, such as heat cramps, which is usually the first stage consisting of cramping and abdominal pain in some instances. Then it can progress to heat exhaustion, which is nausea, filling inability to cool, increased warmth, cramping, dehydration or mild dehydration," he says. "And that can become severe, and that's known as heatstroke, which can cause disorientation, confusion, the ability to cool yourself, nausea and vomiting."</p>



<p>Heat exhaustion happens when the body loses too much water or salt from heavy sweating or dehydration, usually after being active in the heat. Heatstroke is more serious and happens when the body overheats and can't cool down.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to do for heat-related illnesses</h2>



<p>Seeking care promptly for heat-related illnesses is crucial.&nbsp;You should try to cool down quickly, drink cool fluids and stay out of the heat until your symptoms get better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If you have symptoms of heat cramps or heat exhaustion, it's important to stay cool," says Dr. Bracamonte. Seek a cool, shaded place, go indoors, and drink fluids. Consider sports drinks containing electrolyte-hydrating fluids as well — just watch for heavy sugar content.</p>



<p>If you think someone has heat exhaustion, act fast to prevent heatstroke – which can be life-threatening.</p>



<ul>
<li>Move them to a shady or cool area.</li>



<li>Lay them down and elevate their legs.</li>



<li>Loosen tight clothing.</li>



<li>Give them cool fluids to drink.</li>



<li>Cool them with water and a fan.</li>



<li>Monitor their condition closely.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<p>Signs of heatstroke include:</p>



<ul>
<li>High body temperature (104 F or higher).</li>



<li>Altered mental state (confusion, agitation, slurred speech). </li>



<li>Dry or moist skin.</li>



<li>Nausea, vomiting.</li>



<li>Flushed skin.</li>



<li>Rapid breathing.</li>



<li>Racing heart rate.</li>



<li>Headache.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you think someone has heatstroke, call 911 or your local emergency services immediately.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risk factors for heat-related illness</h2>



<p>Some things can make people more sensitive to heat:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Certain <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-heat-and-how-it-affects-medication/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medications </a>(like beta blockers and antihistamines)</li>



<li>Obesity</li>



<li>Sudden changes in temperature (like moving to a hotter climate or early heat waves)</li>



<li>When the heat index is 91 F (33 C) or higher. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have questions about your medication, speak with your healthcare team.</p>



<p>Heat and humidity can pose health risks, so it's important to take precautions to stay safe. Keep cool, stay hydrated, and stay informed to protect yourself and others when it's hot outside.</p>



<p>"Be careful with doing new activities that can get you dehydrated quickly, so acclimate to the heat and don't go out during the warmest parts of the day. Try to find the coolest parts of the day to keep yourself healthy and away from heat-related illness," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>Understanding the risks associated with high heat and humidity, recognizing the symptoms of heat-related illnesses, and knowing how to respond can help prevent serious health issues.</p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. — The heat is on, especially across the South, Southeast, and portions of the plains. The National Weather Service has issued several heat, and excessive heat advisories. When summer goes from warm to hot, exercising could become risky — unless you’re prepared.</p>



<p>“Staying active, even exercising in hot weather, can be done safely, but you really have to pay attention to the environment and your body to make sure a good thing doesn’t go bad,” says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/chaun-cox-md">Chaun Cox, M.D.</a><em>, a Mayo Clinic Health System&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/family-medicine">Family Medicine</a><em>&nbsp;physician and an avid runner.</em></p>



<p>Here are a few tips from Dr. Cox for exercising in the heat:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Know the weather.</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>If you haven’t been exercising in hot weather already this summer, don’t choose a hot day to start. Your body needs to acclimate to the heat, so start with shorter periods of exercise and gradually extend the duration of your workout. High humidity prevents sweat from readily evaporating from this skin, which puts added stress on your body.&nbsp; And pay attention to the forecast — and the sky. Severe weather can develop rather quickly, and there are no extra points for trying to outrun a thunderstorm or tornado.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Your body cools itself by sweating, and if you stay hydrated, the body is pretty good at cooling itself. When you become dehydrated, your body starts to store heat inside. Your core temperature begins to increase, and that can put your organs and nervous system at risk. Drink water before, during and after you exercise. Additionally, make sure you have food throughout the day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Slow down.</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Don’t try to keep up your normal pace and intensity in hot weather. Get comfortable knowing you’ll have to take things a bit easier when the mercury rises. Save your goal of setting a personal best for another, cooler day. Don’t think you have to keep up with your running or workout buddies — at least until the temperature cools off a bit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dress smart.</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Clothing for exercise or working out in hot weather should permit evaporation of sweat from your skin. Wear light-colored, lightweight and loose-fitting items. Clothing also can help protect your skin from the sun, along with plenty of sunscreen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Listen to your body.</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The old adage “no pain, no gain” is false. You should slow down or stop exercising at the first sign of discomfort. Other warning signs of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heat-exhaustion/symptoms-causes/syc-20373250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heat exhaustion</a> include heavy sweating, muscle cramps, fatigue, weakness and dizziness. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-dangers-of-heat-related-illnesses/">Heat stroke</a>, which is more serious, may be indicated by a rapid, weak pulse, confusion and loss of consciousness. If you experience any of these warning signs of heat stroke, call 911 immediately, or alert someone to make the call on your behalf.</p>



<p>Summer fun can include outdoor exercise and workouts. The trick is to be smart about it. By following some simple tips, you’ll get more out of your time outdoors and reduce the risks associated with hot weather.</p>

<p>With all the rain of late, many people may be wondering if it's safe to embrace the weather and indulge in activities like playing or exercising in the rain.</p>



<p>"So, rain itself does not make you sick," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/tanner-dunn-cnp-dnp-apnp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanner Dunn, D.N.P</a>., a family nurse practitioner at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/holmen/services-and-treatments/family-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Holmen</a>, Wisconsin. "However, the effects that rain can have on your body can make you more susceptible to illness."</p>



<p>While getting caught in the rain doesn't directly cause illness, it can lead to a decreased body temperature. This drop in temperature can create an environment where certain bacteria thrive and can weaken your immune system, potentially leading to coldlike symptoms.</p>



<p>Addressing concerns for individuals with immune system issues, Dunn notes that colds are caused by viruses, not by getting wet.</p>



<p>"If you're out in the rain for long periods, especially in very cold conditions, it might affect you. But running errands in the rain here and there doesn't significantly increase your risk," says Dunn.</p>



<p>Regarding hypothermia, Dunn explains, "This time of year, we don't typically see much <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothermia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypothermia</a> because temperatures are generally warmer. However, in colder months, both the outside temperature and the water temperature can increase the risk of hypothermia."</p>



<p>For those who need to be outside in the rain, Dunn recommends several practical tips:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dress in layers</strong>. Use water-repellent outer layers and waterproof footwear to stay dry.</li>



<li><strong>Dry off promptly</strong>. After being in the rain, dry off thoroughly and take a warm shower to help stabilize your body temperature and prevent illness.</li>



<li><strong>Flood safety</strong>. Avoid floodwaters, which can be contaminated and pose hidden hazards. "With the expected heavy rainfall, avoid driving through flooded areas and ensure you're not consuming contaminated water," Dunn advises.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite the potential risks, there are positive aspects to being out in the rain.</p>



<p>"Many people find the sound of rain very therapeutic," says Dunn. "Additionally, exercising in the rain can be beneficial. The rain helps keep you cooler, allowing you to work out longer and more effectively."</p>



<p>Walking in the rain also has respiratory benefits. Rain washes away pollutants and allergens, leaving the air cleaner and potentially improving respiratory health.</p>



<p>"The sound of rain can act as a natural stress reliever, promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality," shares Dunn. "The steady sound of raindrops can provide a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life."</p>

<p><em><strong>Editors note</strong>: June is National Aphasia Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>Imagine being dropped off in a country where you aren't fluent in the local language Even when the native speakers speak slowly, you may understand only portions of what's being said. This is similar to how someone with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aphasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369518" target="_blank">aphasia</a>&nbsp;may feel every day.</p>



<p>Aphasia is an <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/aphasia-putting-the-disorder-into-words" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impairment of language</a> that may affect ability a person's ability to speak, understand spoken language, read, write, use numbers, perform calculations or use nonverbal gestures. It happens after an injury to the brain, most commonly a stroke. However, it also can be caused by a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor or other incident affecting the brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the symptoms of aphasia?</h2>



<p>Aphasia symptoms can range from mild to severe, with each person experiencing their own set of communication weaknesses. Mild forms of aphasia may include only occasional difficulties finding words. But those with severe aphasia can suffer a complete loss of ability to speak or understand spoken and written words.</p>



<p>One of the most common questions about aphasia is, "When will this be better?" Research suggests that most recovery happens during the first four to six months following the injury. However, improvements in communication can continue for years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can you treat aphasia?</h2>



<p>A speech-language pathologist, or SLP, trained in treating aphasia and related disorders can help with recovery. According to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.asha.org/" target="_blank">American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA)</a>, clinical evidence declaring shows that people who receive services from qualified SLPs benefit in quality and quantity of their language recovery.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/speech-language-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Therapy</a> may focus on regaining abilities, strategies to compensate for communication loss or a combination of both. Either way, the main goal of <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/neurology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> is to improve the quality and efficiency of communication.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10 tips for communication success</h2>



<p>An aphasia diagnosis affects not only the person, but also their family and friends. When communicating with a loved one who has aphasia, setting them up for success is essential.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are 10 tips for improving communication with someone who has aphasia:</h3>



<ol>
<li>Continue to treat the person with aphasia as a mature adult.</li>



<li>Reduce background noises, such as the radio, TV and other conversations.</li>



<li>Reduce visual distractions, including the TV and people moving around the area.</li>



<li>Be sure you have the person's attention before speaking to them.</li>



<li>Keep messages short and simple. Speak slowly but naturally. Speaking louder doesn't increase understanding.</li>



<li>Use gestures, facial cues and voice intonation to help the person understand the message, even if they don't understand the words.</li>



<li>Don't assume they understand what you're saying. Your loved one may respond with head nods and sounds of agreement but still not understand what's being said.</li>



<li>Encourage communication and be patient.</li>



<li>Give your loved one plenty of time to respond, and try not to answer for them.</li>



<li>Include the person when they're present. Don't talk about them as if they aren't there. Just as you shouldn't assume comprehension, don't assume lack of comprehension.</li>
</ol>



<p>Recovering speech and language after an aphasia diagnosis can take time and practice, so give your loved one support, and remain calm and focused on <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire/services-and-treatments/neurology/aphasia-camp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improving communication together</a>.</p>
