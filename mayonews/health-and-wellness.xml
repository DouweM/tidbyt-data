<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-stroke-treatment/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Stroke treatment</a></h2>



<p>Each year, an estimated 15 million people around the globe experience stroke, according to the World Health Organization, with one-third resulting in death. When the symptoms of stroke present, calling 911 and seeking care immediately is the most crucial step to prevent disability or death.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/the-4-types-of-systemic-therapy-for-breast-cancer/">The 4 types of systemic therapy for breast cancer</a></h2>



<p>Treatment for breast cancer can come in many forms. In addition to surgery to remove cancerous tissue and radiation therapy, breast cancer also is commonly treated with drugs that are taken orally or intravenously, as an infusion into a vein.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-jessies-journey/">Life after liver transplant — 'Fight… because it's worth it'</a></h2>



<p>Stomach pain is something everyone has probably had at some point in their life. But for Jessie Boyd, her stomach pain set in motion a journey that led her to Mayo Clinic and the experts who could perform a lifesaving surgery.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/research-shows-new-method-helps-doctors-safely-remove-dangerous-heart-infections-without-surgery/#/">Research shows new method helps doctors safely remove dangerous heart infections without surgery</a></h2>



<p>Doctors at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic&nbsp;used a new catheter-based approach to draw out resistant pockets of infection that settle in the heart, known as right-sided&nbsp;infective endocarditis, without surgery. The research is part of a Mayo Clinic-led study across 19 U.S. sites involving patients who were not good candidates for surgery and whose right-sided heart infections had not responded to antibiotics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-experts-highlight-advances-in-breast-cancer-research-decreasing-the-need-for-chemotherapy-and-reducing-the-intensity-of-radiation-therapy/">Mayo Clinic experts highlight advances in breast cancer research</a></h2>



<p>Lifesaving cancer therapies can cause serious side effects, both immediately and later in life. With breast cancer rates rising among younger people, the need for treatments that provide excellent outcomes with fewer side effects is only increasing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shraddha's Story</strong></h2>



<p>It was November 2022, just a month shy of her 28th birthday.</p>



<p>Shraddha was wrapping up another day at the medical clinic where she worked as an occupational therapist. Shraddha's job was to help patients regain the ability to perform day-to-day activities following a health challenge like a surgery.</p>



<p>Suddenly that afternoon, Shraddha became the patient who needed help.</p>



<p>"My co-worker looked at me and said, 'Why is your hand all purple and blue?'" Shraddha says. She admits she had been feeling exceptionally tired as of late, but attributed it to a thyroid condition.</p>



<p>Her co-worker checked Shraddha's vital signs and found her blood oxygen level was dangerously low. "I remember her saying, 'If this is right, you wouldn't even be standing.'" A repeat test showed the same result. "The next thing I remember was we were on our way to the hospital," says Shraddha.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>At the hospital doctors began looking for the cause of Shraddha's low blood oxygen level.  A series of tests traced Shraddha's condition all the way back to the day she was born.</p>



<p>"When I was born, doctors said I had fatty liver, but they didn't know why so they called it 'undiagnosed,'" says Shraddha. "The doctors thought it wouldn't be a problem because the liver has a tendency to heal itself." It didn't. Shraddha grew up seemingly in perfect health, unaware that her <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/the-silent-liver-disease-experts-warn-is-on-the-rise-among-hispanics-and-children/">liver disease</a> was silently doing damage to her body.</p>

<p>Shraddha was born in Mumbai, India which is often called the "City of Dreams." At a young age, Shraddha had big dreams of her own.  She wanted to pursue a career in the medical field that would allow her to help others. </p>



<p>Every year Shraddha went to the doctor for her routine physical. Each time she was given a clean bill of health. "I used to do blood tests, but everything always looked good," says Shraddha. Still, the question of what caused her congenital liver condition lingered in her mind.</p>



<p>"I didn't have a family history of any liver condition. I've never had alcohol in my life," says Shraddha. "There was always a question mark. I needed to find out why this happened to me."</p>



<p>At 23, Shraddha became the first person in her family to leave India and go to the U.S. to attend college. She studied occupational therapy and got her master's degree at the University of Southern California. After college, Shraddha found her dream job at a medical clinic in California.</p>

<p>All was going well until Shraddha began to noticed she was unusually tired. "When my sister came to visit she noticed I got tired after walking short distances. I went to the doctor and they thought maybe it was my thyroid," recalls Shraddha.</p>



<p>Then came the day her hands turned purple and her blood oxygen level mysteriously dropped. "My co-worker is a nurse so she got the oximeter and checked and it was 78%," says Shraddha. "And I was like, No, that's not possible because I wouldn't be alive." Shraddha's co-worker checked again, looked at the reading and said, "That's it, you have to go to the hospital."</p>



<p>A series of tests at the hospital revealed shocking results. Shraddha's liver condition had silently led to a more serious condition called hepatopulmonary syndrome.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hepatopulmonary syndrome</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatopulmonary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20373350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hepatopulmonary syndrome</a> is caused when liver disease shunts blood away from the lungs preventing the body from getting the appropriate amount of oxygen. Doctors told Shraddha the only way she would survive is with a liver transplant. However, she says she was told her condition was so severe and the risk so high, that she would likely not survive a transplant.</p>



<p>She was denied the transplant and given less than a year to live.</p>



<p>"I told the doctors 'that just can't be. I can't have just one year with nothing to bring to this world. I have not served my purpose,'" recalls Shraddha. </p>



<p>Refusing to give up, Shraddha turned to Mayo Clinic in Arizona.</p>



<p>"More than 40% of her blood was being shunted away from her lungs. Because of that she had extremely low oxygen levels in her blood," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bashar Aqel, M.D.</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/sections/expertise-ranking/orc-20203899?customer_id=173-378-9621&amp;mc_id=google&amp;campaign=20718088499&amp;geo=9030070&amp;kw=transplant%20center%20arizona&amp;ad=678670770145&amp;network=g&amp;sitetarget=&amp;adgroup=158054873227&amp;extension=&amp;target=kwd-1284412548384&amp;matchtype=p&amp;device=c&amp;account=1733789621&amp;invsrc=transplant&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1bPG-JO5iQMVrjYIBR0f-AKlEAAYASAAEgKkU_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transplant Center at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.</a> "Shraddha's case was one of the most severe cases of liver disease and hepatopulmonary syndrome."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saving Shraddha</strong></h2>



<p>The liver transplant was Shraddha's only hope for survival. "Without a transplant, this disease was progressive and fatal. We don't like to use this word, but it is a very progressive disease," says Dr. Aqel. "There was no other cure than a liver transplant."</p>



<p>Dr. Aqel and his multidisciplinary team of experts at Mayo Clinic went to work on a strategy to save Shraddha. The team came up with a plan using a combination of some of the latest cutting-edge technologies in medicine. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"<strong>Liver in a box</strong>"</h2>



<p>Transplanting any organ is a race agains the clock. Every second the donor organ is outside the body it begins to break down. Surgeons only have a limited time window to transplant the organ. Due to the complexity of Shraddha's case, Dr. Aqel's team knew they would need extra time. They decided to use one of the latest medical breakthroughs in transplant often referred to as <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-liver-in-a-box-is-saving-lives-with-new-technology/">"liver in a box."</a></p>



<p>Traditionally donor organs are kept cold until transplanted. "Liver in a box" uses a warm organ preservation method. The organ is placed in a container that pumps oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood through the liver simulating conditions in the human body. The innovative perfusion system gives surgeons more time to perform the transplant. </p>



<p>"Having the donor "liver in a box" allowed the donor liver to stay healthy while we performed this complex surgery," says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<p>Currently, this warm perfusion technology is primarily being used for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/heart-transplant-innovation-new-heart-in-a-box-technology-provides-gift-of-life-to-arizona-man-as-couple-prepares-to-celebrate-50-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart, lungs and liver transplants</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saving lives with mobile ECMO</strong></h2>



<p>The next challenge was how to keep Shraddha's blood oxygen levels stable after her transplant. Dr. Aqel's team turned to a device called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/young-patient-with-covid-19-recovering-after-hospital-stay-ecmo-support/">extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO</a>. The device often is used when the lungs aren't working properly. ECMO helps with the appropriate gas exchange that must occur to keep the body's blood oxygen level safe.</p>



<p>"It helps in getting oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out of the blood through the machine," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sen-ayan-m-d/bio-20055718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ayan Sen, M.D.</a>, medical director of Mayo Clinic's Intensive Care Unit in Arizona. "It helped us while her lungs recovered after her transplant."</p>



<p>The Mayo team also used one of the newest advancements in ECMO where the device is mobile. </p>

<p>"The best part of the mobile ECMO was that we do it in a way where she could actually walk around with the machine so that we could continue with her physical therapy, which is so important for the healing process after such a complex surgery," says Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>Shraddha was in the ICU for nearly two months. With mobile ECMO she walked nearly every day.</p>



<p>Dr. Sen says mobile ECMO has proved to be a game-changer in critical cases like Shraddha's.</p>



<p>"It is technology that has really expanded from what surgeons do when they do heart surgeries and transplants where now we can do this to save lives at any place that is not a complex environment, like the ICU or the operating rooms," explains Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>Mobile ECMO has become a lifesaving medical breakthrough for many patients.</p>

<p>"It has enabled us to raise the bar when it comes to saving people, who, until now, could not have been saved in the absence of this heart-lung machine," says Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>A team of highly specialized experts escorted Shraddha on her daily walks, meticulously monitoring her vital signs. Each step required Shraddha to muster every bit of strength she had.</p>



<p>"From the first day, I thought even if it pains me, if it hurts, even if it feels impossible, I still need to put that step forward to do something better today than yesterday," recalls Shraddha. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Mayo's mission is now my purpose'</strong></h2>



<p>Almost two years after her harrowing experience, Shraddha is healthy and back at work. She continues her daily walks, only now, at the beach, in solitude, reflecting on how her own experience can make her a better healthcare professional.</p>

<p>"Mayo Clinic doesn't like to say no. They set out to achieve the unachievable," says Shraddha. "My goal is to treat patients as they do, making them a priority."</p>



<p>Shraddha says words of thanks alone are not enough to convey her gratitude.</p>



<p>"Dr. Aqel and his team achieved something for me that everyone else thought was impossible," says Shraddha. "It was a gift. I will keep the mission of Mayo Clinic in mind when I am serving my patients. My purpose now is to put forward their purpose and help someone else."</p>

<p>Many parts of the U.S. – and the world — will soon "fall back" as daylight saving time ends and clocks fall back one hour. This year, the change takes place in the U.S. at 2 a.m. local time on Sunday, Nov. 3. That means an extra hour of sleep – and earlier sunrises and sunsets. </p>



<p>How does less sun affect your mood and level of energy?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesus-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jesse Bracamonte,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says sunlight can influence the levels of neurochemicals in the brain.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/d3ySCLBD-j4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: The Mayo Clinic Minute</a></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Mayo-Clinic-Minute-How-change-in-sunlight-can-affect-your-mood_CLEAN.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/SCRIPT-MCM-Change-in-sunlight-affect-mood-FINAL29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"People can feel more tired with less light due to the neurochemical or brain hormonal changes that occur with a change of season or less light. A common chemical that regulates that is called serotonin," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>But what happens when you have less exposure to the sun and your serotonin levels are off?</p>



<p>"Your mood may be off, your sleep may be off, the way you regulate your mood cycle — whether you're happy or you're feeling a bit down — can be off. And that can have a downstream effect just the way you feel in general," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Bracamonte says there are things you can do to feel better.</p>



<p>"If you can, get sunlight. Get plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-sleep-spoilers-tips-for-a-good-nights-rest/">rest.</a>&nbsp;Get exercise, be active. Make sure to eat a well-balanced diet full of fruits and veggies," he says.</p>



<p>And consider a light therapy lamp. They are designed to simulate natural sunlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In many cases, I do recommend light therapy for people who aren't getting enough sun to help with mood and balance those neurochemicals out. It's one of the treatments for improving moods, particularly during the gloomy season," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Help your mood with good sleep</h3>



<p>As the time change date approaches, here are two things you can do to alleviate the sleep disturbance that may come along with it.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Adjust your internal clock gradually</strong><br>In the days leading up to the time change, adjust your sleep and wake times in small increments so your body can transition gradually. Shift your bedtime and wake time in 15- to 30-minute increments.</li>



<li><strong>Spend time outdoors</strong><br>Sunlight affects your body's circadian rhythm, and spending time outdoors can alleviate feelings of fatigue that often accompany time changes.</li>

<p>October is National Health Literacy Month. Health literacy refers to the ability of people to find, understand, and use information and services to make informed health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:07) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/SCRIPT-MCM-Health-literacy-for-kids.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Developing personal health literacy — which is the ability to find, understand, and use health-related information and services — is something that can begin early in life.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic is truly an expert in healthcare. And we have an opportunity to be there talking with children, getting them excited about their health and empowering them to have agency over their own health and the health of their communities," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Dr. Mattke says these types of books provide accessible information on a wide range of health and science-related topics.</p>



<p>"I think there's a lot of health topics that children struggle to understand — anything from immunizations to why they're feeling sick, especially when children have serious and complex diseases," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Understanding their disease can help them feel empowered and knowledgeable about how they can participate in their care. But it's not just kids with serious health conditions that can benefit from this education.</p>



<p>"My children have read all these books and have read them multiple and multiple times. And so, they can help understand these diseases. It's inspiring their passion to learn more about science and learn more about health," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Which is another goal of promoting health literacy in children.</p>



<p>"We need to get kids interested in STEM — science, engineering, technology and medicine. And these are really important topics. And so, we're bringing these topics to kids to get them interested at an early age and inspire that passion.," says Dr. Mattke.</p>

<p>What began as a creative backyard project changed Laurie Reese's life forever.</p>



<p>An avid gardener, Laurie envisioned turning an unused outhouse on their property into an ideal garden shed. So on a November day in 2007, Laurie's husband, Pete, used their skid loader to move the structure. While Laurie was guiding Pete, she noticed the outhouse was wobbling, so she put her hands out to steady it. That’s when the structure fell over, trapping Laurie beneath it.</p>



<p>Pete was able to lift the outhouse just enough so that Laurie could pull herself most of the way out from under it, and Pete pulled her the rest of the way to safety. Paramedics took Laurie from her home in Oronoco, Minnesota, to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota/campus-buildings-maps/mayo-clinic-hospital-saint-marys-campus" target="_blank">Mayo Clinic Hospital, Saint Marys Campus</a>&nbsp;in Rochester, Minnesota.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A sobering prognosis</h2>



<p>Laurie and Pete learned that two vertebrae in her thoracic (middle) spine were damaged. She had a fracture of the T12 vertebrae and a fracture dislocation of the T11 and T12 vertebrae.</p>



<p>The next day, she underwent nearly six hours of surgery. Her prognosis following the operation was dire: Laurie would have a 0-3% chance of walking again.</p>



<p>"I was in shock and not really thinking clearly. So many things were running through my head," Laurie says. "I was just 39 and wondered if this injury would shorten my life. Our daughter was pregnant with our first grandchild, and I thought, 'Well, I've still got use of my arms, so at least I can hold the baby.'"</p>



<p>Thoughts of her future grandchild spurred her to work especially hard in therapy to gain as much strength, movement and ability to do everyday tasks as possible. Laurie also knew two people who had quadriplegia, so she understood the reality of her situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing for her new life&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="244" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/reese-walking-in-therapy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395478" style="aspect-ratio:3/4;object-fit:cover;width:278px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p>Laurie began rehabilitation while still in the hospital, then transferred to the Mary Brigh Building on the Saint Marys Campus for intensive, inpatient rehabilitation to adapt to her new life. </p>



<p>In rehab, Laurie worked with physical and occupational therapists to practice and learn a wide range of skills and activities, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Stretching her legs.</li>



<li>Rolling over and sitting up.</li>



<li>Inserting a catheter.</li>



<li>Using a wheelchair.</li>



<li>Transferring in and out of vehicles.</li>



<li>Showering and dressing.</li>



<li>Using a machine that supported her, braced her legs and simulated walking.</li>



<li>Performing daily chores like cooking, doing the dishes and opening cupboards. </li>
</ul>



<p>"Before they let you leave rehabilitation, you go home for a day," Laurie says. "That's when the reality hits you that this is your life going forward."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adapting, learning and doing what she wants </h2>



<p>By December 20, Laurie was ready to return home. Once home, outpatient therapy and occupational therapists make suggestions for adapting the house to meet her needs. To accommodate her wheelchair, the Reeses added a ramp to the house and eventually remodeled the kitchen.</p>



<p>Once the basics were manageable, Laurie focused on resuming the things she loved to do, such as gardening, horseback riding and snowmobiling.</p>



<p>Pete made modifications so she could indulge in her love of flowers. He revamped the garden beds to make them smaller and more manageable, built raised beds that Laurie could reach and added a fountain.</p>



<p>Another goal of Laurie's was to try horseback riding again. She was able to sit on her horse a couple of times but realized it wasn't feasible to safely ride.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="660" height="370" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/reese-posed-on-snowmobile.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395477" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/reese-posed-on-snowmobile.jpg 660w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/reese-posed-on-snowmobile-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure></div>


<p>Snowmobiling was a different story. After testing her comfort and ability on an older machine, she opted to get a new one with upgrades like an electric start, reverse gear, heated hand warmers and more. With a strap anchoring her legs, she's taken several trips — and even some spills — and continues to tinker with the design of her seat.</p>



<p>Since the accident, Laurie has been determined to live life on her own terms. With help from her therapists and plenty of practice, she stood for pictures at a daughter's wedding.</p>



<p>She holds, cares for and plays with her eight grandchildren. When she wants to see them, she loads her wheelchair onto the lift bed, gets into her pickup and drives to their homes.</p>



<p>Laurie also returned to work in cardiovascular education for Mayo Clinic in Rochester, a position she's held for 19 years. She provides digital education for medical staff needing board certification or recertification.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nearly 20 years of success</h2>



<p>Although it's been 17 years since her accident, Laurie still battles issues like pressure sores that landed her in the hospital for three months this year. That hospitalization set her back, and she spent nearly three months in rehabilitation at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/cannon-falls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Cannon Falls</a>, Minnesota.</p>



<p>"It still can be rough. Some days are better than others, and I get jealous of those who can easily do something like picking up a baby," she says. "And nothing is as easy as you think it will be, but you make it work. You have to have the mindset and the drive to constantly adapt."</p>



<p>What helped Laurie develop that mindset and drive was a journal her rehab team encouraged her to write in the hospital after her initial injury. The journal evolved into a book, "My Life Beyond the Outhouse: The First Two Years." Laurie focused on the first two years because she was most likely to regain any mobility during that time.</p>



<p>"Publishing the book helped me talk about my injury, and my family and friends got a better understanding of what I was going through," Laurie says. "People who read it say they had no idea how much of your life is affected by being paralyzed."</p>



<p>While her life changed on that November day, it didn't end. Laurie attributes her success to her rehabilitation team and their ongoing care.</p>



<p>"I couldn't have asked for better people on my side. When I cried, they gave me a shoulder to cry on," she says. "I can't imagine not having the training they gave me. Because of them, I was able to start out in a new capacity, and today, I'm able to do almost whatever I want."</p>



<p>"Even now, when I go in for appointments, they remember me and know my story. It's so neat that out of the thousands of patients they've seen, we still have that connection."</p>

<p>There are plenty of frights to go around on Halloween, but a hand injury probably isn't one you'd expect.</p>



<p>"Interestingly, it's the fourth busiest holiday for hand injuries," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kakar-sanjeev-sanj-m-d/bio-20055340?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Sanj Kakar</a>, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic hand and wrist surgeon.</p>



<p>Dr. Kakar says almost one-third of those Halloween hand injuries are among kids ages 10 to 14. And most of them happen when people are carving pumpkins.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post.<br>Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/MCM-3-tips-to-avoid-Halloween-hand-injuries-SCRIPT3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"It's primarily stabbing injuries where the knife may slip, and, so, they can cut things like tendons, which are the ropes that help move your hands," Dr. Kakar says. "But they can also break bones, and also they can burn themselves, as well, with candles."</p>



<p>But Dr. Kakar says most of the injuries are avoidable.</p>



<p>"A lot of people might just go to the kitchen and grab a sharp knife. But there's good studies out there showing that actual pumpkin-specific carving knives [are safer], [because] actually the force needed to injure yourself, is higher if you use one of those than if you use a standard knife," he says. "So I would use a pumpkin carving kit, No. 1."</p>



<p>No. 2, Dr. Kakar says, is to let kids handle designing the jack-o'-lantern, but make sure adults do all of the carving.</p>



<p>And No. 3, make sure you're always supporting the pumpkin with your noncutting hand.</p>



<p>"So if you're right-handed, use your left hand to support the pumpkin and carve from the top down as opposed to the bottom up," Dr. Kakar says. "It's very easy for the knife to slip and go into your hand."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-performs-its-first-paired-living-liver-donation/">Mayo Clinic performs its first paired living liver donation</a></h2>



<p>People can donate up to 70% of their liver because the liver has the&nbsp;unique ability to regenerate itself within a month. While paired living donation is commonly used for kidney transplants, it is relatively rare for liver transplants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Surgeons recently performed Mayo Clinic's first paired living liver donation, a significant first step in helping more people with liver failure get a lifesaving transplant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-radiation-therapy-for-patients-with-breast-cancer/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Radiation therapy for patients with breast cancer</a></h2>



<p>Radiation therapy is a common component of breast cancer treatment for patients. The high-powered beams of intense energy kill cancer cells and reduce the risk of the cancer recurring.</p>



<p>Dr. Laura Vallow, chair of the Radiation Oncology Department at Mayo Clinic in Florida, explains how innovation is transforming radiation treatments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-clean-out-old-medications-safely/#/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Clean out old medications safely</a></h2>



<p>Leftover or expired medications can be dangerous if not disposed of properly. Safely getting rid of unneeded prescriptions, like opioids or expired drugs, is essential to prevent&nbsp;misuse&nbsp;and accidental harm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Tina Ardon, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says proper medication disposal helps safeguard your home and community from unnecessary risks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-what-standing-on-one-leg-can-tell-you/">What standing on one leg can tell you about aging</a></h2>



<p>How long a person can stand — on one leg — is a more telltale measure of aging than changes in strength or gait, according to new Mayo Clinic research. Good balance, muscle strength and an efficient gait contribute to people's independence and well-being as&nbsp;they age.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-shockwave-therapy-may-help-relieve-foot-problem/">Shockwave therapy may help relieve foot problem</a></h2>



<p>Shockwave therapy is a noninvasive treatment that uses sound waves to transmit energy to tissues to help with the healing process. It can be used for foot and ankle issues including plantar fasciitis, tendinitis, stress fractures and shin splints.⁠</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — How long a person can stand — on one leg — is a more telltale measure of aging than changes in strength or gait, according to new <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> research. The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0310764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> appears today in the journal PLOS ONE.</p>



<p>Good balance, muscle strength and an efficient gait contribute to people's independence and well-being as&nbsp;they age. How these factors change, and at what rate, can help clinicians develop programs to ensure healthy aging. Individually, people can train their balance without special equipment and work on maintaining it over time.</p>



<p>In this study, 40 healthy, independent people over 50 underwent walking, balance, grip strength and knee strength tests. Half of the participants were under 65; the other half were 65 and older.</p>



<p>In the balance tests, participants stood on force plates in different situations: on both feet with eyes open, on both feet with eyes closed, on the non-dominant leg with eyes open, and on the dominant leg with eyes open. In the one-legged tests, participants could hold the leg they weren't standing on where they wanted. The tests were 30 seconds each.</p>

<p>Standing on one leg — specifically the nondominant leg — showed the highest rate of decline with age.</p>



<p>"Balance is an important measure because, in addition to muscle strength, it requires input from vision, the vestibular system and the somatosensory systems," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kaufman-kenton-r-ph-d/bio-20054278?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenton Kaufman, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the study and director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/motion-analysis/overview?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motion Analysis Laboratory</a> at Mayo Clinic. "Changes in balance are noteworthy. If you have poor balance, you're at risk of falling, whether or not you're moving. Falls are a severe health risk with serious consequences."</p>



<p>Unintentional falls are the leading cause of injuries among adults who are 65 and older. Most falls among older adults result from a loss of balance.</p>



<p>In the other tests:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Researchers used a custom-made device to measure participants' grip. For the knee strength test, participants were in a seated position and instructed to extend their knee as forcefully as possible. Both the grip and knee strength tests were on the dominant side. Grip and knee strength showed significant declines by decade but not as much as balance. Grip strength decreased at a faster rate than knee strength, making it better at predicting aging than other strength measures.</li>



<li>For the gait test, participants walked back and forth on an 8-meter, level walkway at their own pace and speed. Gait parameters didn't change with age. This was not a surprising result since participants were walking at their normal pace, not their maximum pace, Dr. Kaufman says.</li>



<li>There were no age-related declines in the strength tests that were specific to sex. This indicates that participants' grip and knee strength declined at a similar rate. Researchers did not identify sex differences in the gait and balance tests, which suggests that male and female subjects were equally affected by age.</li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. Kaufman says people can take steps to train their balance. For example, by standing on one leg, you can train yourself to coordinate your muscle and vestibular responses to maintain correct balance. If you can stand on one leg for 30 seconds, you are doing well, he says.</p>



<p>"If you don't use it, you lose it. If you use it, you maintain it," Dr. Kaufman says. "It's easy to do. It doesn't require special equipment, and you can do it every day."</p>



<p>Funding for this study includes the Robert and Arlene Kogod Professorship in Geriatric Medicine and W. Hall Wendel Jr. Musculoskeletal Professorship.</p>

<p>Is your medicine cabinet lined with prescriptions you're no longer using?&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's not uncommon that I hear patients have a lot of leftover medications or medications they no longer need to use, and that can include opioid pain medications, maybe after surgery or an injury," says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Leftover medications</h2>

<p>Holding on to medication for potential future use is discouraged.</p>



<p>"There can be the tendency sometimes to reach for something that was used for another purpose, for a new pain. And we want to make sure, again, our patients are using medications that are right for their issue," she says.</p>



<p>And it's not just pain medication. Using any medicine for something it wasn't meant for may lead to side effects or other problems.</p>



<p>"A common example is using leftover antibiotics that can cause resistance to some of the bacteria that are out there. We want to make sure we are using our antibiotics appropriately," says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>She says take your medications completely as prescribed and safely dispose of those you are no longer using. You can check with your local pharmacy or …</p>



<p>"Consider National Take Back Day, which is a great way to be able to dispose of your medication safely, and we can all contribute to having safer practices with our medications," says Dr. Ardon.</p>

<p>Patients with breast cancer now have more options when it comes to radiation treatments. The goal is to remove any remaining cancer cells following chemotherapy or surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"In other situations, we use radiation if the cancer is more advanced, or spread to the lymph nodes," says Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>Advancements in technology allow healthcare professionals to treat patients more safely. One technique called "prone positioning" reduces the chance of beams targeting other organs. For this procedure, patients lie on their stomachs.</p>

<p>"We take advantage of gravity, the breast pulls away from the body, and we can treat the breast without exposing the underlying lung and heart to unnecessary radiation," explains Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is cutting-edge. Unlike traditional radiation, this procedure delivers X-rays directly to the targeted area from multiple angles, allowing for higher, more effective doses.</p>



<p>"Before intensity-modulated radiation therapy, we were not able to conform the dose around the chest wall," says Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>For patients undergoing radiation therapy, it's crucial to stay hydrated and try to sleep well to fight fatigue. It's also important to use sunscreen after treatment.</p>
