<p>ROCHESTER, Minn., and REDMOND, Wash. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, a world leader in healthcare known for its commitment to innovation, is among the first healthcare organizations to deploy <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a>. This new generative AI service combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with organizational data from Microsoft 365 to enable new levels of productivity in the enterprise.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is testing the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/05/09/introducing-the-microsoft-365-copilot-early-access-program-and-new-capabilities-in-copilot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program</a> with hundreds of its clinical staff, doctors and healthcare workers.</p>



<p>“Microsoft 365 Copilot has the ability to transform work across virtually every industry so people can focus on the most important work and help move their organizations forward,” said Colette Stallbaumer, general manager, Microsoft 365. “We’re excited to be helping customers like Mayo Clinic achieve their goals.”</p>



<p>Generative AI has the potential to support Mayo Clinic’s vision to transform healthcare. For example, generative AI can help doctors automate form-filling tasks. Administrative demands continue to burden healthcare providers, taking up valuable time that could be used to provide more focused care to patients. Microsoft 365 Copilot has the potential to give healthcare providers valuable time back by automating tasks.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is one of the first to start working with Copilot tools to enable staff experience across apps like Microsoft Outlook, Word, Excel and more. Microsoft 365 Copilot combines the power of LLMs with data in the Microsoft 365 apps, including calendars, emails, chats, documents and meeting transcripts, to turn words into a powerful productivity tool.</p>



<p>“Privacy, ethics and safety are at the forefront of Mayo Clinic’s work with generative AI and large language models,” said Cris Ross, chief information officer at Mayo Clinic. “Using AI-powered tech will enhance Mayo Clinic’s ability to lead the transformation of healthcare while focusing on what matters most — providing the best possible care to our patients.”</p>



<p>As a leader in healthcare, Mayo Clinic is always looking for new ways to improve patient care. By using generative AI and LLMs, Mayo Clinic will be able to offer its teams new timesaving tools to help them succeed.</p>

<p>Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19 are all part of the seasonal respiratory virus lineup. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the upcoming fall and winter are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/about/season-outlook.html#outlook">expected</a>&nbsp;to have a similar number of hospitalizations for respiratory diseases as last year.

<p></p>



<p>"We saw in Australia that they had a typical to, in some areas, more severe influenza season. And that's what I expect this year is more of what we saw pre-pandemic," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>"Whether it's an average year or a more severe year will be based on a few factors: how well people abide by all the lessons we learned about staying home when you're sick, masking if you're sick, getting your influenza vaccination, but also the type of virus that's circulating," he says.</p>



<p>The CDC says the 2023 Southern Hemisphere flu vaccine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7237e1.htm?s_cid=mm7237e1_w">reduced</a>&nbsp;hospitalizations by 52%. If similar influenza virus strains spread in the Northern Hemisphere, the 2023-24 vaccine might provide equal protection.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Strains of influenza</h3>



<p>Dr. Binnicker says there has been a predominance of a few different strains of influenza over the last few years.</p>



<p>"One is called H3N2 influenza A virus, a common influenza A virus that circulated for years. And then, in some areas, the pandemic strain from 2009, the H1N1 influenza strain, has also been in circulation. We typically see those influenza A strains anywhere from November to February or March here in the U.S.," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>"We also see a strain of influenza called influenza B, which usually causes a little bit less severe disease, and that typically comes up toward the tail end of the influenza season, in the February, March and April timeframe," he adds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing illness during respiratory season </h3>



<p>There are some unknowns in the outlook, including the timing, the specific virus strains and what new COVID-19 variant might emerge. That's why prevention is critical, says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>The good news is that there are vaccines for these three seasonal illnesses, including updated&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-expert-answers-questions-about-the-new-covid-19-vaccine/">COVID-19 vaccines</a>&nbsp;and new vaccines for the prevention of RSV in those 60 and older,<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/drug-to-prevent-rsv-in-babies-approved-what-you-need-to-know/">&nbsp;infants</a>&nbsp;and those who are&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/fda-grants-vaccine-approval-for-moms-to-be-to-prevent-rsv-in-newborns/">pregnant.</a></p>



<p>"It's an exciting time in terms of prevention strategies for these viruses," says Dr. Binnicker. "Then you get to the basics: good hand hygiene. If you're sick, stay home. If you have to get out, wear a mask if you have any of these symptoms. And then testing so we know what we're dealing with and can take good steps to prevent transmission to other people.”</p>

<p>"Fall is a very common season for seasonal allergies to kick in," says Dr. Li.</p>



<p>And ragweed is usually the biggest culprit.</p>



<p>"If an allergic person with ragweed sensitivity goes outside, they inhale ragweed pollen grains — little pollen plant proteins — that land in the lining of the nose," says Dr. Li. "And in that allergic person, there is an inflammatory response or an allergic response that causes the swelling, the runny nose and the mucus production" — …</p>



<p>… making life miserable for people with seasonal allergies.</p>



<p>"Nasal congestion, sneezing, runny nose, maybe itching of the nose or the mouth, as well as similar eye symptoms — eyes water, turn red or get itchy," says Dr. Li.</p>



<p>The first step in getting relief: Reduce your exposure by limiting time outdoors when pollen counts are high. Second: Try over-the-counter medications, like antihistamines, decongestants and allergy nasal sprays, which can help control the symptoms. And if those don't help, make an appointment with a healthcare professional, like an allergist.</p>



<p>"We'll go through the allergy tests, and one of the treatments we will at least talk about would be <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/allergy-shots/about/pac-20392876?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allergy shots</a>," says Dr. Li. "And the payoff is that their allergy symptoms can be significantly improved."</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:06) is available in the downloads at the end of the post.&nbsp;Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."&nbsp;Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/06/Mayo-Clinic-Minute-How-to-use-an-asthma-inhaler_SCRIPT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>When asthma symptoms flare, an inhaler is the first line of treatment. Different types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/in-depth/asthma-inhalers/art-20046382?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inhalers</a> serve different purposes, and knowing how to use each type is key to breathing easier.</p>



<p>"There are short-acting inhalers, which is like our rescue inhalers," says Dr. Squire. "For more persistent asthma, we're going to recommend a daily inhaler."</p>



<p>Rescue inhalers, also called metered-dose inhalers, are pressurized to deliver medication fast. To get the most medicine in your lungs, Dr. Squire recommends using a spacer — a holding chamber between the inhaler and mouth.</p>



<p>"Place the spacer into your mouth and take a deep breath in," says Dr. Squire. "Hold your breath to at least the count of five. Ten is even better. Then slowly exhale. Repeat as needed."</p>



<p>Dr. Squire says the process differs slightly for dry-powder inhalers, which should not be used with a spacer.</p>



<p>"Place your hands on the side you want to avoid covering the opening on the top," says Dr. Squire. "With a dry-powder inhaler, you're going to take a little bit faster and deeper breath, compared to a metered-dose inhaler. Again, hold your breath to at least the count of five. Then slowly exhale."</p>



<p>Dr. Squire recommends that if you have any questions or concerns to ask your physician or other healthcare professional to review your inhaler technique.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> A friend has a family history of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> and obesity. She is diligent about eating healthfully and enjoys sharing new recipes and information about food. Recently she mentioned a sugar substitute called erythritol. I'm not familiar with this product. Can you explain what it is and if it is healthy?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Sugar is one of those ingredients that always seems to be in the news.</p>



<p>Eating and drinking too much sugar can negatively affect one's health. Sugar found naturally in food, such as whole fruits, is not associated with increased health issues. But added sugar has been shown to contribute to dental cavities and is associated with multiple chronic diseases such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, obesity, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatty liver disease</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Type 2 diabetes</a>.</p>



<p>Sugar has many forms. Most people are familiar with sucrose, the white granulated sugar found most often in kitchens, and raw sugar, also called turbinado sugar, which is crystalized and light brown. Other examples of sugar include high-fructose corn syrup and other sweeteners, which are often added to drinks and baked goods.</p>



<p>Because of the known health risks associated with added sugars, the food industry has produced numerous <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/artificial-sweeteners/art-20046936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sugar substitutes</a> with the intention of feeding our collective sweet tooth while minimizing the negative consequences of sugar.</p>



<p>Saccharin was the first commercially produced sugar substitute. Over the years, saccharin has fallen out of favor as it was found to negatively affect the good bacteria in our small intestines and gut, putting people at increased risk for Type 2 diabetes and obesity. But dozens of other sugar substitutes have been developed.</p>



<p>One class of sugar substitutes that seemed promising is a group called “sugar alcohols," of which erythritol is a member. Sugar alcohols are sweet but are neither sugar nor alcohol. Sugar alcohols are derived from sugar, usually created by hydrogenating sugar or by fermenting it. Examples of sugar alcohols include xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol. Often, we find these in processed foods, such as gum or candy.</p>



<p>Erythritol occurs naturally with the fermentation of fructose (fruit sugar) and is found in extremely low levels in various fruits such as melon, pears, grapes and in fermented foods, including dairy cheese and soy sauce. Our red blood cells also naturally make very low levels of erythritol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When used as a food additive, erythritol is used at concentrations at least 1,000 times the natural levels found in food or our bodies.</p>



<p>While your friend may hope to lessen her risk for chronic illness by avoiding added sugar, it is important to note that sugar substitutes are not without risk. In recent decades, some concerning research has been published about possible adverse health effects of erythritol.</p>



<p>An American study from 2001 found that people who used erythritol as a sweetener had a three-year increased risk of major adverse cardiac events – defined as non-fatal heart attack or stroke. While this was an incidental finding – meaning that the erythritol did not necessarily cause or contribute to their cardiac issues – it highlighted the need for more research to determine if using a sugar substitute predisposes a person to higher heart attack or stroke rates.</p>



<p>A 2021 study examined people who consumed erythritol or a similar sugar alcohol, xylitol. The results found that ingesting erythritol as a sugar substitute caused a spike in blood levels and increased the stickiness of the volunteers’ platelets. Platelets help the blood to clot if we cut ourselves, but if they are sticky, the risk of blood clots in the body increases, raising our risk of heart attack, stroke or other vascular issues.</p>



<p>While the findings still do not definitely prove that erythritol directly increases the risk for cardiovascular issues, the results indicate it may be best to avoid it until we have more evidence to suggest that it is or is not safe.</p>



<p>Rather than chasing the perfect sugar substitute, it is best to minimize added sugars in our diet and reprogram a sweet tooth through other means.</p>



<p>If you are craving a sweet treat, grab a piece of whole fruit, such as an apple, pear, peach or plum. Fruit is a much healthier investment than foods sweetened with added sugar or sugar substitutes. Besides, research shows that a whole-food, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/recipes/healthy-plant-based-recipes/rcs-20533034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plant-based diet</a> prevents chronic diseases.</p>



<p>There are no shortcuts to healthy eating. The American Heart Association recommends that adults limit their daily sugar intake to 24 grams (six teaspoons) for women and 36 grams (nine teaspoons) for men. If you feel you need more guidance or want more information about how to make positive changes in your diet, consider making an appointment with a nutritionist or dietitian. — <strong><em>Jennifer Drost, P.A., and </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mussallem-dawn-m-d-o/bio-20055494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Dawn Mussallem, D.O.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Integrative Medicine and Health, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/integrative-medicine-and-health-services-in-arizona/sections/overview/ovc-20529683"><strong><em>Lifestyle Medicine</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, and Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But what if you have at-home COVID-19 tests nearing expiration or expired on your shelf?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/binnicker-matthew-j-ph-d/bio-20513862?_ga=2.224776410.1916523742.1658847814-1971724449.1645459629?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Binnicker, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview/specialty-groups/clinical-microbiology?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Virology Laboratory</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic, says companies set the original test dates arbitrarily due to these diagnostic at-home tests being developed rapidly. So, check your boxes before you toss them.</p>



<p>“Now that we are 3 1/2 years into the pandemic, those manufacturers have had the opportunity to go back and assess the test performance over prolonged periods of time. And they've updated the expiration dates in many cases,” says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>His first recommendation if you have tests at home is to search the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests">website</a>&nbsp;for information on updated expiration dates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If you take a test that is beyond the expiration date, and the test is positive, that's likely a reliable result, especially if you have a respiratory illness. If you get a negative result from a test that is beyond the expiration date, I'd recommend making sure the test doesn't have an extended expiration date. And if it's beyond that, then definitely go out and get another test or go in and have a healthcare provider collect a swab for a lab-based test before you rule out COVID-19," Dr. Binnicker says.</p>

<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can at-home tests detect current strains of COVID-19?</h3>



<p>"Yes, they should detect the currently circulating strains of COVID-19. The good news is that most of the changes in the virus with these new variants are in the spike protein, which is the part of the virus that binds to the cells. And the protein these antigen tests are looking for is a different protein where not as many mutations occur. So that allows us to confidently say that these tests should pick up the circulating strains," says Dr. Binnicker.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Testing positive</h3>



<p>Are you contagious if you test positive for COVID-19?&nbsp;&nbsp;Most likely, says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>"When an at-home antigen test is positive, it means that that person is still shedding or excreting a high amount of viral protein. In most cases, that means that the person is shedding a high amount of virus, and likely a high amount of virus that could be spread from one person to another," he says.</p>



<p>He says if you get a positive at-home antigen test, consider yourself at risk of spreading the virus to others.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Testing negative</h3>



<p>Dr. Binnicker says testing at home is recommended if you experience COVID-19 symptoms. If it comes back positive, you likely have a COVID-19 infection. But what if you have symptoms and the test comes back negative?&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If your test comes back negative at home, and you still have those typical symptoms of COVID-19 — sore throat, cough, fever, body aches — that's when I'm recommending that people go in to see their healthcare provider, get a swab collected that can be sent to a lab for a PCR-based test. That will give us the most reliable information on whether you truly have, or don’t have, COVID-19," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When should you test for COVID-19?</h3>



<p>Dr. Binnicker says there are few instances recommended for testing.</p>



<ul>
<li>If you develop symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose or body aches.</li>



<li>If you've spent time with someone with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.&nbsp;</li>



<li>If you plan on visiting a person at high risk of severe illness. That includes a person with cancer, an older adult or someone taking medications that suppress their immune system.</li>
</ul>



<p>He says if you've been exposed to the virus, don't test immediately.</p>



<p>"My recommendation is to wait a few days, don't go right home and take a test because it won't have been enough time for the virus to reach levels that will trigger antigen tests to be positive. Typically, wait three days after an exposure and then take a test. If it's negative, consider taking another test the following day or 48 hours from then; typically, by day five after exposure, you're likely in the clear if you test negative over that timeframe," he says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Temperatures and at-home COVID-19 tests</h3>



<p>With the many fluctuating temperatures across geographic areas, can these tests be affected by high heat or cold temperatures? The information packets that come with at-home antigen tests should offer storage condition information as determined by the FDA. That's where reading the fine print can help.</p>



<p>"If you're in an area that has experienced subzero weather or temperatures well above 100, like many parts of the country have during the summer months, it is always a good idea to check the packet that comes with a test to look for the acceptable storage conditions," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>

<p>The nose is the subject of many sayings. A measurement could be on the nose or an object be right under your nose. You may be reminded to keep your nose clean and keep it out of another's affairs.</p>



<p>While often the focus of these idioms, your nose also can be affected by physical conditions, such as nasal polyps. These are soft, painless, noncancerous growths on your nasal passages or sinus linings and hang down like teardrops or grapes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nasal-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20351888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nasal polyps</a> may form anywhere in your sinuses or nasal passages. But they most often appear in an area where the sinuses near your eyes, nose and cheekbones drain through winding passages into your nose.</p>



<p>Here's what you need to know about these small growths.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What causes nasal polyps?</h2>



<p>Nasal polyps often result from chronic inflammation of the nasal passages. That's why people who have chronic sinusitis have an increased risk of developing nasal polyps.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/chronic-sinusitis-more-than-a-stuffy-nose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chronic sinusitis</a>&nbsp;is when the sinuses become swollen and inflamed for more than 12 weeks. This causes the lining in the nose to make more mucus, while the swollen lining interferes with drainage.</p>



<p>People with asthma, allergies, drug sensitivities or certain immune disorders also have an increased risk for nasal polyps.</p>



<p>Scientists don't yet fully understand why certain conditions and inflammation trigger polyps to form in some people and not in others. Nasal polyps can develop at any age but are most common in young and middle-aged adults.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the common symptoms of nasal polyps?</h2>



<p>A person can have nasal polyps and not know it, especially small ones. Larger or multiple polyps can cause a sensation of nasal congestion, impaired sense of smell and taste, decreased airflow and recurring sinus infections.</p>



<p>Some people with nasal polyps develop an intolerance to over-the-counter pain-relieving medications like ibuprofen and naproxen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can nasal polyps cause health complications?</h2>



<p>Nasal polyps can cause complications because they block airflow, fluid drainage and long-term inflammation underlying their development. In some people, they cause worsening asthma or structural changes in the sinuses.</p>



<p>Many people with nasal polyps have recurring sinus infections. This increases antibiotic exposure and could lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/c-difficile/symptoms-causes/syc-20351691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clostridium difficile</a>, also called C-diff, a potentially severe gastrointestinal infection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How are nasal polyps treated?</h2>



<p>The treatment goal for nasal polyps is to reduce their size or eliminate them. Medication usually is the first approach. Surgery sometimes may be needed, but it may not provide a permanent solution because polyps tend to recur.</p>



<p>Nasal steroids and budesonide rinses may reduce swelling and irritation. These treatments may shrink polyps or eliminate them completely.</p>



<p>If you have nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis, your healthcare team may give you an injection of a medication called dupilumab, commonly known as Dupixent, to treat your condition. This biologic medication may reduce the size of the nasal polyps and lessen congestion. It's often prescribed by an allergist and can be administered at home.</p>



<p>Nasal polyps in children typically are treated with topical medications and dupilumab.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can you prevent nasal polyps?</h2>



<p>You may be able to reduce your chances of developing nasal polyps or having polyps come back after treatment by reducing inflammation in your nose and sinuses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Start by following these tips:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Manage allergies and asthma.</strong><br>Follow treatment recommendations from your healthcare team. If your symptoms aren't well-controlled, ask about changing your treatment plan.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid nasal irritants.</strong><br>As much as possible, avoid breathing airborne substances that are likely to contribute to swelling or irritation in your nose and sinuses, such as allergens, or allergy-causing agents; tobacco smoke; chemical fumes; dust; and fine debris.</li>



<li><strong>Practice good hygiene.</strong><br>Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly. This is one of the best ways to protect against bacterial and viral infections that can cause inflammation of the nasal passages and sinuses.</li>



<li><strong>Humidify your home.</strong><br>Using a humidifier may help moisten your breathing passages, improve the flow of mucus from your sinuses, and help prevent blockages and inflammation. Clean the humidifier daily to eliminate bacterial growth.</li>



<li><strong>Use a nasal rinse.</strong><br>Use a saline spray or nasal wash to rinse your nasal passages. This may improve mucus flow, and remove allergens and other irritants.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How are nasal polyps diagnosed?</h2>



<p>Your healthcare team usually can make a diagnosis based on your answers to questions about your symptoms, a general physical exam and an examination of your nose. Polyps may be visible with the aid of a simple lighted instrument called a nasal endoscope.</p>



<p>They also may suggest skin tests to determine if allergies are causing chronic inflammation. With a skin prick test, tiny drops of allergens are pricked into the skin of your forearm or upper back. Your healthcare team observes your skin for signs of allergic reactions. If a skin test can't be performed, a blood test can screen for specific antibodies to various allergens.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team if you have recurring sinus infections, infections that last longer than 12 weeks, impaired smell or taste, or are having trouble breathing through your nose.</p>

<p>Every year in the U.S., roughly 2.2 million children under 15 are seen in emergency departments for injuries related to falls.</p>



<p>"You can see things as simple as little cuts and bumps and bruises, to broken bones to big head injuries," says Dr. Raukar.</p>



<p>About half of those injuries occur in toddlers, kids 4 and under.</p>



<p>"If you think about kids and how they're exploring their environment, it's good to just be aware of what they're doing," says Dr. Raukar.</p>



<p>While falls can occur anywhere, windows and stairs are common causes of fall-related injury and death in young children. To keep your child safe, install window guards and stops. Keep windows locked and closed when not in use. And for those kids that like to climb, move furniture away from the windows, and use approved safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs.</p>



<p>As kids get older, injuries from falls outside the home, such as bicycling or on the playground, are more likely to occur. Falls on the playground account for almost 200,000 trips to the emergency room each year. </p>



<p>"When they're outside playing on the playground, make sure that you have a nice soft surface for them to land off the monkey bars or off of a jungle gym," says Dr. Raukar.</p>



<p>And when biking, skateboarding or other fun stuff, protect the head by wearing a helmet.</p>
