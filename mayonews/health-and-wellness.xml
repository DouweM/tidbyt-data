<p>Many parts of the U.S. – and the world — will soon "fall back" as daylight saving time ends and clocks fall back one hour. This year, the change takes place in the U.S. at 2 a.m. local time on Sunday, Nov. 5. That means an extra hour of sleep – and earlier sunrises and sunsets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does less sun affect your mood and level of energy?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesus-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jesse Bracamonte,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says sunlight can influence the levels of neurochemicals in the brain.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/SCRIPT-MCM-Change-in-sunlight-affect-mood-FINAL29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"People can feel more tired with less light due to the neurochemical or brain hormonal changes that occur with a change of season or less light. A common chemical that regulates that is called serotonin," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>But what happens when you have less exposure to the sun and your serotonin levels are off?</p>



<p>"Your mood may be off, your sleep may be off, the way you regulate your mood cycle — whether you're happy or you're feeling a bit down — can be off. And that can have a downstream effect just the way you feel in general," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Bracamonte says there are things you can do to feel better.</p>



<p>"If you can, get sunlight. Get plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-sleep-spoilers-tips-for-a-good-nights-rest/">rest.</a>&nbsp;Get exercise, be active. Make sure to eat a well-balanced diet full of fruits and veggies," he says.</p>



<p>And consider a light therapy lamp. They are designed to simulate natural sunlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In many cases, I do recommend light therapy for people who aren't getting enough sun to help with mood and balance those neurochemicals out. It's one of the treatments for improving moods, particularly during the gloomy season," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Help your mood with good sleep</h3>



<p>As the time change date approaches, here are two things you can do to alleviate the sleep disturbance that may come along with it.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Adjust your internal clock gradually</strong><br>In the days leading up to the time change, adjust your sleep and wake times in small increments so your body can transition gradually. Shift your bedtime and wake time in 15- to 30-minute increments.</li>



<li><strong>Spend time outdoors</strong><br>Sunlight affects your body's circadian rhythm, and spending time outdoors can alleviate feelings of fatigue that often accompany time changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>COPD is a leading cause of disability and death in the U.S., according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/learn-about-copd/how-serious-is-copd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Lung Association</a>. More than 12.5 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with COPD, but millions more may have the disease without knowing it.</p>

People with COPD are at increased risk of developing respiratory infections, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lung cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/symptoms-causes/syc-20350697?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary hypertension</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depression</a>. Also, if you have a chronic lung disease such as COPD, you may be at greater risk of severe illness and complications from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-who-is-at-risk/art-20483301?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a>.</p>



<p>Factors that can increase your risk of COPD include exposure to tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asthma</a>; occupational exposure to dust and chemicals; exposure to fumes from burning fuel; and genetics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Symptoms of COPD often don't appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time, particularly if cigarette smoke exposure continues.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of COPD can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shortness of breath.</li>



<li>Wheezing.</li>



<li>Chest tightness.</li>



<li>Chronic cough that may produce clear, white, yellow or green mucus.</li>



<li>Frequent respiratory infections.</li>



<li>Lack of energy.</li>



<li>Unintended weight loss.</li>



<li>Swelling in the ankles, feet or legs.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>If you've been diagnosed with COPD and you smoke, it is important that you quit. Most cases of COPD in the U.S. are directedly related to long-term cigarette smoking. Stopping smoking can prevent COPD from worsening and reducing your ability to breathe.</p>



<p>Many people with&nbsp;COPD&nbsp;have mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than quitting smoking. Even for more advanced stages of the disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353685?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment</a>&nbsp;for COPD can include medications, lung therapies, in-home noninvasive ventilation therapy, managing exacerbations and surgery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Coping</strong></h2>



<p>Living with&nbsp;COPD&nbsp;can be a challenge — especially as it becomes harder to catch your breath. You may have to give up some activities you previously enjoyed. Your family and friends may have difficulty adjusting to some of the changes.</p>



<p>It can help to share your fears and feelings with your family, friends and healthcare team. You also may want to consider joining a support group for people with&nbsp;COPD, and you may benefit from counseling or medication if you feel depressed or overwhelmed.</p>



<p>If you have&nbsp;COPD, these strategies can help you feel better and slow the damage to your lungs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Control your breathing.</strong><br>Talk to your primary healthcare professional or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions, energy conservation techniques and relaxation techniques that you can use when you're short of breath.</li>



<li><strong>Clear your airways.</strong><br>With&nbsp;COPD, mucus tends to collect in your air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier may help.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong><br>It may seem difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance and strengthen your respiratory muscles. Discuss with your healthcare team which activities are appropriate for you.</li>



<li><strong>Eat healthy foods.</strong><br>A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength. If you're underweight, your healthcare professional may recommend nutritional supplements. If you're overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during times of exertion.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid smoke and air pollution.</strong><br>Besides quitting smoking, avoiding places where others smoke is important. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage. Other types of air pollution also can irritate your lungs, so check daily air quality forecasts before going out.</li>



<li><strong>See your healthcare team regularly.</strong><br>Stick to your appointment schedule, even if you're feeling fine. It's important to regularly monitor your lung function and let your healthcare team know if you have worsening symptoms or notice signs of infection. Be sure to get your annual flu vaccine in the fall to help prevent infections that can worsen your&nbsp;COPD and ask your healthcare team when you need the pneumococcal vaccine. </li>

<p>You just got a shot in the arm, and now your arm hurts.</p>



<p>"You can have a little bit of swelling, a little bit of redness, definitely achiness. These are all common," says Dr. Bracamonte. "Most of the time, it lasts about two or three days."</p>



<p>He says, in most cases, those symptoms mean that the vaccine is working.</p>



<p>"It's your body's immune system kind of reacting to the vaccine, which, in general, can be a good thing. So those symptoms are generally pretty mild and very common. It's very unusual that a patient doesn't have some type of slight reaction — a little soreness, a little malaise, maybe feel a little feverish but not with a high fever," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says over-the-counter pain relievers, a heating pad or just staying active can all help with the soreness.</p>



<p>"It can be more severe, such as if you have trouble breathing, swelling, severe redness or pain out of proportion. Then I always encourage my patients to give me a call and let me know what's going on. But those cases are very rare," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<p>You can hear the excitement of Halloween in their voices as kids dress up in their favorite costumes with the hopes of collecting a bounty of candy. Now, what to do with all that sugar?</p>



<p>"I think the first thing I would do is give them a couple of pieces. That seems reasonable, but too much of anything can be a bad thing," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>She says to set a limit, then put the candy away so it is not easily accessible.</p>



<p>"We recommend that they keep a little bit of it, that's fine, but they don't need 5-10 pounds of candy each year because this is certainly going to increase the risk of cavities as well as other things," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>And help avoid an extra dental visit by encouraging good oral hygiene.</p>



<p>"If your kid is having candy, making sure that they are using good brushing and flossing techniques," Dr. Mattke says.</p>



<p>And, along with keeping a few pieces, consider having kids donate the rest of the candy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Some dentists collect candy and ship them overseas to our armed forces. And there are other locations where you could also donate the candy," says Dr. Mattke.</p>

<p>Stress is a physical and psychological reaction to a demand, and that demand can be anything, Dr. Debar says. Stress that is good for us and may even give us a sense of well-being is eustress, the opposite of distress. The same event—for example, getting married—might provoke either one, Dr. Debar says.</p>



<p>"It's about the perception of that stress and how your body is actually handling it," Dr. Debar says. "<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chronic stress</a> will impact every organ system in the body: You might feel anxiety, depression and digestive issues, for example."</p>



<p>Stress prompts a cascade of reactions within the mind and body as you mount a stress response, Dr. Debar says. Under normal stress, a person starts at a baseline of relaxation, encounters a stressor, the stress response begins, rises to a peak, and then comes back down to baseline.</p>



<p>Among the physical changes that may occur when you perceive a threat:</p>



<ul>
<li>The sympathetic nervous system and production of the primary stress hormone, cortisol, activate.<em></em></li>



<li>Thinking becomes negative as you experience or anticipate something bad. Attention becomes hyperfocused on what is happening.<em></em></li>



<li>The heart, lungs and muscles prepare for you to fight or run. There is increased heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate as the body needs to deliver more oxygen to cells. Muscles tense.</li>



<li>The digestive and reproductive systems aren't needed, so their activities slow.</li>



<li>The immune system turns its attention from fighting microscopic invaders such as viruses or cancer cells and goes into an inflammatory mode, increasing its production of proteins called cytokines that adjust this process. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>When someone realizes the threat has passed, the body begins to repair itself from this response and “tidy up”. It shifts to a repair, renew and growth state as the stress response is mopped up. Physically, breathing and heart rate slow down, blood pressure normalizes, you take more expansive breaths, muscular tension eases, the digestive and reproductive systems resume normal activity, and you may begin to connect with others to recount the threat you just experienced, Dr. Debar says<em>.</em></p>



<p>"If you go up in stress and then come back down, you have completed our cycle. There's no wear and tear, there's no damage," Dr. Debar says. "In fact, it's probably good for you because it leads to greater resilience. If you’ve ever overcome a stressful event in life, processed it fully and completed that cycle, then the next similar experience you have, you think, `Oh no, but I can do it.'"</p>



<p>However, when someone is repeatedly under too much stress, the ability to go back to baseline slowly starts to wane, Dr. Debar says.</p>



<p>"You can go up in stress and stay there, having a prolonged response. This is when you're hypervigilant: You're wired but tired, you're anxious," Dr. Debar says. "Or, life has thrown at you so many stressors, that you respond inadequately. It is the lack of recovery rather than the actual stressor itself that is critical. After a while, you may just numb out and show no response."</p>



<p>Sometimes people think it would be good to show no response, Dr. Debar adds, but internally the stress response and its cascade of internal activities are still happening. They are just hidden.</p>



<p>There are several signs that you may be in danger of stress overload and it is time to address it, Dr. Debar says:</p>



<ul>
<li>If stress feels unremitting and constant.</li>



<li>If stress feels uncontrollable and you're unable to relax or feel like you're on autopilot.</li>



<li>If you have problems regulating emotions.</li>



<li>If you start hiding from life and/or people.</li>



<li>You're experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches, chest pain, stomach upsets, problems sleeping, or getting sick more often.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Think about how your body handles stress, and how you handle it emotionally, physically and in your relationships," Dr. Debar says. "What do you do, what do you not do."</p>



<p>Chronic stress can have long-term health effects. People who feel ongoing physical symptoms or find that <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relievers/art-20047257?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lifestyle changes</a> do not seem to help should consult with their health care team, Dr. Debar says.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Specific techniques may differ among practitioners. In general, during spinal manipulation, the practitioner applies a controlled amount of force to a spinal joint in the neck or back, either manually or using a device. Sometimes the force terminates in a quick, shallow thrust to the targeted joint. Alternatively, a rhythmic, nonthrust force also can be applied to improve joint motion in your spine and pelvis. The practitioner also may use a special table to help perform spinal adjustments more effectively. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Practitioners who perform spinal manipulation also may perform a massage-type technique called soft tissue mobilization, either immediately before or just following spinal manipulation. Like spinal manipulation, soft tissue mobilization also can be performed by specially trained chiropractors, osteopathic doctors, physical therapists and medical doctors. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Several types of soft tissue mobilization exist, but one of the more common approaches is called myofascial release. Like massage, this approach is typically performed on the skin. It combines slow, low-pressure glides over the affected muscles and connective tissues with higher-pressure holds as your body is slowly guided through specific movements. Like spinal manipulation, the purposes of soft tissue mobilization are to alleviate pain and to optimize movement, as well as to release tension in tight muscles affecting your spine. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Spinal manipulation is generally considered to be safe when it's performed by a trained and licensed practitioner. Common side effects are soreness in the treated area, dizziness or tiredness. These problems typically clear up within one to two days. Serious side effects are rare but may include pinching of spinal nerves, resulting in leg pain and weakness, or worsening of a herniated disk. Thrust manipulation to the neck has rarely been associated with stroke.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Spinal manipulation generally isn't recommended if you have severe </span><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/basics/definition/con-20019924?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><span style="color: #003da5;text-decoration: none">osteoporosis</span></a><span style="color: #202426">, cancer in your spine, previous spinal surgery or inflammatory arthritis.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">In situations where spinal manipulation is considered unsafe, your healthcare professional may recommend alternative options, depending on the cause of your neck or back pain. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">These may include one or a combination of the following: specific home exercises and stretches for your spine, massage therapy, yoga, tai chi, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, oral medications, or spinal injections. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">If you're considering spinal manipulation therapy, ask your healthcare professional for a referral. Importantly, let the practitioner doing the spinal manipulation know about any other conditions you may have and other treatments you may be receiving. <span style="color: #000000"><em>— <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/holmes-benjamin-ben-d-d-c-ph-d/bio-20530358?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><strong>Dr. Benjamin Holmes</strong></a>, and</em></span> </span><b><i> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/gay-ralph-e-m-d-d-c/bio-20053457?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Dr. Ralph Gay</a><strong><span style="color: #202426">, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</span></strong></i></b></p>

<p>Developing personal health literacy — which is the ability to find, understand, and use health-related information and services — is something that can begin early in life.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic is truly an expert in healthcare. And we have an opportunity to be there talking with children, getting them excited about their health and empowering them to have agency over their own health and the health of their communities," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Dr. Mattke says these types of books provide accessible information on a wide range of health and science-related topics.</p>



<p>"I think there's a lot of health topics that children struggle to understand — anything from immunizations to why they're feeling sick, especially when children have serious and complex diseases," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Understanding their disease can help them feel empowered and knowledgeable about how they can participate in their care. But it's not just kids with serious health conditions that can benefit from this education.</p>



<p>"My children have read all these books and have read them multiple and multiple times. And so, they can help understand these diseases. It's inspiring their passion to learn more about science and learn more about health," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Which is another goal of promoting health literacy in children.</p>



<p>"We need to get kids interested in STEM — science, engineering, technology and medicine. And these are really important topics. And so, we're bringing these topics to kids to get them interested at an early age and inspire that passion.," says Dr. Mattke.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I've always been a high achiever, both personally and professionally. But I struggle with a whirlwind of worries and thoughts, constantly second-guessing myself and pushing for perfection. I've heard the term "high-functioning anxiety," and I feel like it is what I'm experiencing. How can I navigate and cope with this? </p>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>It's normal to feel anxious sometimes, especially in stressful situations. However, for some people, excessive and ongoing anxiety can be a challenge to control and interferes with daily activities.</p>
<p>There are several types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">anxiety disorders</a>. The term "high-functioning anxiety" represents people with anxiety symptoms while maintaining a high level of functionality in various aspects of their lives. Often, they are successful in their careers or other roles, yet internally struggle with persistent feelings of stress, self-doubt, and the fear of not measuring up. They feel extremely uncomfortable inside and struggle with significant self-criticism.</p>
<p>High-functioning anxiety isn't recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but instead is a subset of generalized anxiety. Many emotional and physical symptoms are associated with generalized anxiety disorder. The symptoms of high-functioning anxiety mirror many of these, but some may be more prominent.</p>
<p>Some symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder include overall general nervousness and worry. Other symptoms that may lead you towards high-functioning anxiety include internal struggles with:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Fears of criticism or significant self-criticism.</li>
<li>Fears of looking inadequate or foolish to others.</li>
<li>Feeling on the edge or on the verge of losing control.</li>
<li>Sense of impending doom.</li>
<li>Significant stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important that you meet with a mental health professional to talk about your symptoms and obtain an accurate diagnosis. Then, if it is determined that you have high-functioning anxiety, you can develop a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20350972mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">care plan</a> for having the best quality of life.</p>
<p>Counseling and therapy play crucial roles in helping people with high-functioning anxiety manage their symptoms effectively. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/psychiatry-and-psychology">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a> can help you learn to reframe your thoughts about life and transform behaviors that may feed your anxiety. Instead of being self-critical and looking for what could go wrong, you can be taught to manage your thoughts, seek solutions and guide yourself through anxious feelings.</p>
<p>In addition to therapy, other coping strategies to ease symptoms include: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating a support network.</strong><br />People with high-functioning anxiety may believe they must deal with their behaviors alone because they fear criticism or negative outcomes. A positive support network of people who care for you, regardless of outcomes, can help ease anxiety symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Establishing healthy boundaries. <br /></strong>This can help improve relationships with others and establish rules for yourself. The importance of saying "no" is often talked about as part of boundary setting. That's because many people overextend themselves — but some people with high-functioning anxiety also should embrace saying "yes" to opportunities that stretch their comfort levels. Their lives grow in experiences and fulfillment the more they face their fears.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting comparisons.</strong><br />People with anxiety tend to compare themselves to others, feel the need to improve and want to be more like someone else. Comparison can rob you of joy and contentment.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying core values.</strong><br />Some people with high-functioning anxiety become fixated on society-defined success, like having the "right" job, car, house and material possessions. Often, these items are only important because other people believe they are important. A therapist can help you uncover what is important to you outside society's expectations and align your thoughts and actions with your core values.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to accept criticism.<br /></strong>This can be difficult for many people but especially people with high-functioning anxiety. You may find yourself getting defensive. A therapist can help you identify ways to step back at this moment and evaluate the feedback neutrally without emotion.</li>
<li><strong>Practicing mindfulness.<br /></strong>This is the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/use-mindfulness-to-improve-well-being">practice of purposefully being aware</a> of and focusing on the present moment. Concentrating on one thing or moment can increase feelings of calm and peace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Medications can help some people with high-functioning anxiety, but should only be used in conjunction with other coping strategies and under the care of a healthcare professional.</p>
<p>Talk with your healthcare team about how you are feeling. They can connect you to a skilled mental health counselor or therapist, if needed, and assist you with coping strategies to manage your anxiety and lead a fulfilling life. — <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/linda-hubbard-lmft"><em>Linda Hubbard</em></a><em>, Psychotherapy, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire">Eau Claire, Wisconsin</a></em></strong></p>

<p>"Fifth disease is a relatively common infection in childhood," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rajapakse-nipunie-s-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20308514?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse,</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;pediatric infectious diseases physician with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's Center</a>.

<p>"The most common symptoms that children will usually have with this infection are fever, maybe some runny nose and then a characteristic rash that usually turns their cheeks bright red, and then they may develop a more kind of lacy-looking rash on their extremities and trunk," she says.</p>

<p>Adults infected with parvovirus 19 may have different symptoms than children.</p>



<p>Joint pain or swelling is less common but more frequent in adults. The virus also can temporarily stop the body from making new red blood cells, leading to anemia. People with sickle cell disease and weakened immune systems are at higher risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Rajapakse says parvovirus B19 spreads through respiratory secretions, such as contact with droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The virus can spread through blood and from a pregnant woman to her child. If a pregnant person suspects exposure to parvovirus B19, they should tell their healthcare team as soon as possible due to potential rare fetal complications if the mother lacks immunity.</p>



<p>"Parvovirus B19 is a viral infection that is quite common in childhood. If you test them, most adults show signs that they had this infection when they were a child," says Dr. Rajapakse. "The rash usually isn't causing too many symptoms, so it doesn't need any specific treatment. And as the child's body fights off the virus, the rash usually resolves along with that."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h3>



<p>There are no vaccines or medications to prevent infection, but there are ways to reduce your chances of getting infected or transmitting the infection to others.</p>



<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>



<li>&nbsp;Practice good hand hygiene by covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing.</li>



<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>



<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>



<li>Stay home and avoid others when you are sick.</li>
</ul>



<p>Parvovirus B19 affects only humans. You can't contract it or transmit it to dogs or cats. However, different parvoviruses can affect pets.</p>



<p>Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, got its name from being the fifth in a list of childhood illnesses known for causing a rash,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parvovirusb19/fifth-disease.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a>&nbsp;to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>



<p>In the U.S., the virus peaks in winter and spring. The CDC reports mini outbreaks every three to four years.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My spouse suffers from chronic pain after a back injury five years ago. The pain affects his ability to work and enjoy day-to-day activities with our family. Seeing him in pain and not knowing how to help is difficult for me. How can I support him on the challenging days when the pain is more severe and encourage him on the good days?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> For millions of people, living with chronic pain can significantly affect their daily activities, relationships, work and well-being. Chronic pain is typically categorized based on the duration of pain experienced.</p>



<p>The pain or discomfort people feel while recovering from an injury or illness is considered acute or subacute. Pain lasting beyond usual recovery from a trauma-related event or surgery, typically 12 weeks, is considered chronic. Pain can transition from acute to chronic, depending on a person's recovery process.</p>



<p>Chronic pain can cause a person to avoid activities that cause further pain. This can lead to muscle weakness, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/radiofrequency-ablation-pain-relief?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint problems</a> and being more prone to injury. These avoidance behaviors also can lead to psychological isolation and stress. Moving the body and being physically active are crucial for long-term pain management. Encouragement from family, friends and caregivers to stay active and motivated is vital in improving physical health and psychological well-being.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/8-tips-for-managing-chronic-pain?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Central sensitization pain</a> presents additional challenges, including mood changes and fatigue. Patients with central sensitization pain may experience heightened pain responses during physical activity.</p>



<p>It's important that loved ones understand the effect of chronic pain on a person's daily life. Not being able to engage with family and friends can lead to mood symptoms, such as anxiety, helplessness and hopelessness.</p>



<p>It's beneficial to encourage people with chronic pain to maintain a sense of normalcy, remain involved in social activities and stick to a routine sleep schedule.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/caregiving-self-care-during-beyond-the-covid-19-pandemic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">caregivers</a> should balance encouraging activity and enabling passivity, as helping can exacerbate physical and psychological limitations and dependency.</p>



<p>When supporting someone with chronic pain, here are some ways a loved one can help:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Understand the nature of chronic pain.<br></strong>Recognize that chronic pain differs from acute pain and can last beyond the expected recovery period. Be aware of the different types of chronic pain and their effect on your loved one's life.</li>



<li><strong>Encourage movement and physical activity.<br></strong>Motivate the person to do gentle exercises, stretching or physical therapy, even if it initially causes some discomfort. Gradually increasing activity levels can help improve pain and overall functioning.</li>



<li><strong>Support a balanced routine.<br></strong>Help establish a regular <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ways-to-get-better-sleep?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep schedule</a> and ensure the person is exposed to daylight during the day. Encourage healthy habits, such as maintaining a nutritious diet and avoiding substances like drugs or smoking. Understand that someone with chronic pain may have fluctuating levels of pain. Encourage them to participate in social events and integrate into family meals or outings when they feel up to it.</li>



<li><strong>Provide emotional support.</strong><br>Chronic pain can take a toll on a person's mental health. Listen when needed, offer emotional support and encourage open communication about their feelings and experiences. Help them seek professional help if needed. Understand that pain can be unpredictable, and the person may have good and bad days. Practice patience, flexibility and adaptability to accommodate their needs and limitations.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid enabling behaviors.<br></strong>While being empathetic is important, avoid reinforcing a sedentary or inactive lifestyle. Encourage independence and motivate the person to participate in their daily activities as much as possible.</li>



<li><strong>Stay informed and advocate for proper medical care.</strong><br>Educate yourself about the specific condition causing pain, available treatments and strategies for managing pain. This knowledge will help you better understand and support the person's journey. Help the person find healthcare professionals who specialize in chronic pain management. Advocate for their needs and ensure they receive appropriate medical attention, including seeking second opinions if necessary.</li>



<li><strong>Encourage self-care.</strong><br>Remind the person to prioritize self-care, including practicing <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/mindfulness-meditation-improve-your-quality-of-life?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaxation techniques</a>, pursuing hobbies and engaging in activities that bring joy and reduce stress.</li>
</ul>



<p>Remember, people's experience with chronic pain is unique to them, so it's essential to tailor your support to their needs. <em>— <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/qasim-raza-mbbs-md?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Dr. Qasim Raza</a></strong></em><strong><em>, Pain Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Barron</strong></em></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire">Eau Claire</a></strong></em><strong><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire">, Wisconsin</a></em></strong></p>
