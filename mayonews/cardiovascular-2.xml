<p></p>



<p>"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" is an adage that Mayo Clinic cardiologist Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez says remains true today.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1024" height="683" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-360607 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat.jpg 1687w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"No matter how difficult prevention might look, it is way better than treating heart disease."</p><cite>Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p></p>
</div></div>



<p>And prevention, he says, can start small by focusing on the simple things, like&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-8-heart-healthy-diet-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diet</a>&nbsp;and exercise.</p>



<p>"Trying to eat healthier a little bit at a time, to move around through the day, avoiding sitting for too long," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>A positive outlook also can go far in your physical well-being. Enjoy a walk with a friend, for instance.</p>



<p>"Trying to find purpose every day, and trying to give love every day, because those are some of the emotional things that we don't take care of (that) also affect the heart," he says.</p>



<p>And finally, he says if you are prescribed medication for high&nbsp;blood pressure or high&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>, avoid the risk of a heart attack and follow your doctor's orders.</p>



<p>"Take those medications, check your numbers and be sure that all those factors are well under control," Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips and strategies for a heart-healthy diet</h3>



<ul>
<li>Eat more vegetables and fruits for vitamins, minerals, and heart health.</li>



<li>Select whole grains for fiber and nutrients.</li>



<li>Choose healthy fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated options.</li>



<li>Opt for low-fat proteins, including lean meat, poultry, fish and legumes.</li>



<li>Reduce salt intake to lower blood pressure.</li>



<li>Control portion sizes to manage calorie intake.</li>



<li>Plan daily menus emphasizing vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins and good fats.</li>



<li>Enjoy occasional treats in moderation without derailing your healthy eating plan.</li>

<p>Sudden cardiac arrest is among the leading causes of death in the U.S., and this year alone, more than 350,000 people will experience <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest</a>.

AEDs can be found in many public places and don’t require any special training to use. However, knowing where to look for them and how to use them could potentially help save someone’s life.</p>

<p>"I really want people not to be afraid to use an AED because applying an AED to someone who has collapsed and doesn't have a pulse can actually save their life and save their life in a way that they won't have long-lasting consequences," says Dr. Gallo De Moraes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to use an AED</h2>



<p>If someone has fainted and might need an AED:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Check to see if the person is breathing and has a pulse.</strong></li>



<li><strong>If you cannot feel a pulse and the person is not breathing, call for emergency help.</strong> If there are other people present, one person can call 911 while the other prepares the AED. If you're alone, call 911 or emergency services first to make sure help is on the way.</li>



<li><strong>Turn on the AED.</strong> The automated external defibrillator gives you step-by-step voice instructions. It will tell you how to check for breathing and pulse and how to position electrode pads on the person's bare chest.</li>



<li><strong>Deliver the shock.</strong> When the pads are in place, the AED automatically measures the person's heart rhythm and determines if a shock is needed. If it is, the machine tells the user to stand back and push a button to deliver the shock. The AED is programmed not to deliver a shock if a shock isn't needed.</li>



<li><strong>Start CPR.</strong> Begin CPR after the shock is delivered if CPR is still needed. The AED also will guide users through CPR. The process can be repeated as needed until emergency crews take over.</li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. Gallo De Moraes says CPR is the most important thing to do after the shock of the AED is delivered.</p>



<p>"Once you start chest compressions, the AED will give you a countdown clock for two minutes, and it will remind you to stop compressions at two minutes so it can analyze again," says Dr. Gallo De Moraes.</p>



<p>She says if the audio instructions are followed, there’s no way to further hurt or injure someone by using an AED.</p>



<p>AED devices are often found in public places, such as schools, sports stadiums and airports, and are also carried by emergency medical services. AEDs should be in easily accessible and visible locations where they can quickly be retrieved in the event of a sudden cardiac arrest. Signs with the AED heart-shaped symbol should be located above where the devices are located.</p>

<p>Lubb-dupp. Lubb-dupp. Those are the words that healthcare professionals often use to mimic the sound of your heartbeat. That steady, regular sound is made by your heart valves opening and closing as blood circulates through your heart.</p>



<p>You may have heard the term "heart murmur.” A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-murmurs/basics/definition/con-20028706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">murmur</a>&nbsp;is an extra heart sound that can be heard by a stethoscope. Sometimes, the murmur sounds like a humming, which can be faint or loud. It might be temporary or persistent. Heart murmurs may be present at birth or develop later in life during pregnancy, phases of rapid growth like adolescence or from a fever or anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The murmur may disappear as quickly as it comes if it has a temporary cause. However, a murmur also could be persistent and loud, easily heard and sound like a churning mill wheel or cooing seagull. This might indicate a serious heart problem.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What causes a heart murmur?</h3>



<p>Multiple factors can cause a murmur.&nbsp;It could be a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-valve-disease/basics/definition/con-20036065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart valve problem</a>&nbsp;or a hole in the heart.</p>



<p>The valves in your heart act as doors between the chambers, or rooms, of the heart. In the case of a murmur, a valve may be tight or leaky. When heart valves are very tight or narrow, this is called stenosis. A murmur also might be from a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/treating-mitral-valve-regurgitation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaky valve</a>, called regurgitation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A murmur also may occur from high blood flow in people with a fever or with low red blood cells, called anemia.</p>



<p>Some people have a family history of heart murmur and heart disease.&nbsp;Some are born with a&nbsp;congenital condition causing a murmur. Others have had a recent severe infection or illness that could damage a heart valve and need immediate medical attention.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are the symptoms?</h3>



<p>Innocent or harmless heart murmurs don't typically cause symptoms, and most aren't serious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Symptoms of a serious or worrisome heart murmur depend on the cause and require evaluation by a healthcare professional. These symptoms may include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Blue or gray lips or fingernails</li>



<li>Chest pain</li>



<li>Fainting&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fever&nbsp;</li>



<li>Leg swelling&nbsp;</li>



<li>Lingering cough</li>



<li>Shortness of breath</li>



<li>Sudden weight gain</li>



<li>Swollen liver or neck veins</li>



<li>Worsening fatigue</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How is it diagnosed?</h3>



<p>It’s common for a heart murmur to be detected during a physical exam being given for another reason. If a healthcare professional hears a murmur, you'll be asked questions about your personal and family history that could indicate a reason for the murmur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several criteria are used to determine if a murmur is innocent or worrisome, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Volume —&nbsp;</strong>The loudness of the murmur is evaluated on a scale from 1 to 6. The loudest heart murmur is a 6.</li>



<li><strong>Location —&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The location of the murmur in the heart will be identified, along with whether the sound spreads to the neck or back.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Pitch —&nbsp;</strong>The murmur may be high-, medium- or low-pitched.</li>



<li><strong>Timing of the murmur —&nbsp;</strong>A murmur that occurs when blood leaves the heart is a systolic murmur. A murmur that occurs when the heart fills with blood is called a diastolic murmur. A murmur also may be heard throughout the heartbeat. When the murmur is heard as blood passes through the heart, it may be a sign of a larger heart problem.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>You will need to undergo testing to determine the cause of the heart murmur. Your healthcare professional will likely order an ultrasound picture of your heart, called an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/basics/definition/prc-20013918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>&nbsp;or echo, to show detailed images of your heart’s valves, chambers, structure and function.</p>

<p>Once the cause has been found, some people will need repeated evaluation. Others may need surgery to treat the cause of the murmur, especially if it is to adjust a tight or leaky valve or to close a hole in the heart.</p>



<p>In some situations, people may need to take antibiotics before going to a dentist to protect the heart valves from potential infection. This infection, called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endocarditis/basics/definition/con-20022403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endocarditis</a>, can be spread via the bloodstream during dental work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to learn if a heart murmur is innocent or serious so you can get the proper treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Physiologically, AugMAP can be considered a marker of global left ventricular contractile function," says Chieh-Ju Chao, M.D., senior associate consultant in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Department of Cardiovascular Medicine</a> and the study's first author. "AugMAP is easily calculated from the patient's blood pressure and mean aortic gradient, and we found that low AugMAP is associated with higher mortality in all moderate aortic stenosis patient subgroups."</p>



<p>Aortic stenosis is one of the most common cardiac valvular abnormalities, affecting about 5% of people older than 65 years. For most patients with moderate aortic stenosis, clinical guidelines call only for periodic monitoring with echocardiography, a test that uses sound waves to show how blood moves through the heart. However, growing evidence shows that patients with moderate aortic stenosis have poor longer-term survival rates and could benefit from earlier intervention.</p>



<p>The study looked at 4,563 patients with moderate aortic stenosis who were treated at Mayo Clinic from January 2010 through December 2020. The findings indicate that AugMAP is a better prognostic tool compared to other available measures and can detect early-stage left ventricular dysfunction before a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction is observed. "With this information, we can identify patients at higher risk of mortality with current management strategies and initiate discussion about other treatment strategies," says Dr. Chao.</p>



<p>"Moderate aortic stenosis does carry a higher risk of morbidity and mortality compared to the general population based on several prior studies," says senior author <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/arsanjani-reza-m-d/bio-20163932?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reza Arsanjani, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.&nbsp;"Current guidelines recommend active surveillance although earlier intervention might benefit select patients.&nbsp;Our study could potentially identify high-risk individuals who might benefit from earlier intervention."</p>



<p>The authors say future studies should consider whether patients with lower AugMAP can benefit from earlier intervention rather than periodic monitoring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A recent study based on real-world community patient data confirms the effectiveness of the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE), developed by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology in 2013. The PCE is used to estimate a person's 10-year risk of developing clogged arteries, also known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atherosclerosis</a>, and guide heart attack and stroke prevention efforts. Study findings are published in the <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.07.018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American College of Cardiology</a>.</p>



<p>The new study highlights to patients and clinicians the continued reliability and effectiveness of the PCE as a tool for assessing cardiovascular risk, regardless of statin use to lower cholesterol.</p>



<p>The PCE serves as a shared decision-making tool for a clinician and patient to evaluate their current status in preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The calculator considers input in the categories of gender, age, race, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for high blood pressure, diabetes status, and smoking status.</p>



<p>Using retrospective data from more than 30,000 patients enrolled in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/quantitative-health-sciences/divisions/epidemiology/research/rochester-epidemiology-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rochester Epidemiology Project</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers found the PCE performed well at the community level and with relative accuracy between sexes, across age groups and race. The use of statin medications to lower cholesterol did not change the value of the predictions, even though the PCE was developed before statins became widely available. The tool also retained its accuracy when using measurement factors, such as blood pressure, age and cholesterol levels, that were outside the original risk profile range.</p>



<p>"We have seen the excellent performance of the Pooled Cohort Equation over the years in clinical practice," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-b-a/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study. "The study shows that this tool is reliable, not only in light of new cholesterol-lowering drugs, but for patients who previously were not evaluated with the PCE because maybe their blood pressure was higher or lower than the standards, or they did not fit the age profile, for example. By including patients with values outside the accepted range, I think we can calculate the risk for heart attacks in another 20% to 25% of patients, which is not small."<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>

<p>Lifestyle modification is essentially the mainstay of cardiovascular disease prevention, and clinicians talk with patients about what to focus on to prevent the serious consequences of a heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>"Beyond wellness questions about exercise, diet, stress level and good sleep, the PCE guides the conversation to decide if it's time to talk about starting treatment for high cholesterol or hypertension. With this study, we wanted to provide confidence that the Pooled Cohort Equation still performs well at the community level, and our data supports that," says Jose Medina-Inojosa, M.D., a research scientist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Statins are medications that reduce the amount of cholesterol made by the liver.</p>



<p>"Cholesterol builds within plaques that accumulate and grow inside the arteries, sometimes to the point that those arteries will be blocked," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/cholesterol.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-263459" style="width:550px;height:309px" width="550" height="309" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/cholesterol.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/cholesterol-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A medical illustration of cholesterol plaque in an artery.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>And blocked arteries can lead to coronary heart disease. But are statins for everyone?&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The patients that will benefit from taking statins the most will be individuals with history of heart attacks, strokes and other conditions known to be caused by cholesterol plaques," he says.</p>



<p>Diet also plays an important role. Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says to eat less processed meat and more grains, fruits and vegetables.</p>



<p>"The most impactful changes people can make to lower cholesterol will include consuming less animal products other than fish, consuming less saturated fat," he says.</p>



<p>And if your healthcare team recommends medication as well as lifestyle changes?</p>



<p>"Take those medications, check your numbers, be sure that all those factors are well under control,” says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."

<p>"Colorectal cancers and breast cancers are on the rise in the Hispanic community. And one of those reasons may be from lack of preventive screening," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says culture, access to care and past experiences contribute. But early screening can prevent future serious health issues.</p>



<p>"Screening tests for diabetes&nbsp;(such as checking a simple blood sugar), for cardiovascular disease to prevent strokes&nbsp;(such as checking on cholesterol and blood pressure), colon cancer screening,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/when-to-start-regular-breast-cancer-screenings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer screening</a>&nbsp;for females, are all available tools," he says.</p>



<p>Talk with your doctor to determine the right preventive screenings and when to begin. For instance:&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Colon cancer screening for both men and women, usually at age 45, is an option, breast cancer screening for women in their 40s such as with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram,</a>" he says.</p>

<p>Dr. Bracamonte recommends having a list of questions for your doctor about what you can do to stay healthy.</p>



<p>"Have that list prepared about what I should get done to keep me healthy in the long term. What behaviors can I do in the long term to stay healthy? Because I think prevention is a key," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

Some raise your blood pressure. Others make medicines you take to lower your blood pressure less effective. Some medicines that affect blood pressure are prescribed by your healthcare team. Others are available without a prescription.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>How medications can affect your blood pressure</strong></h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Pain medications</strong> </h3>



<p>Some medicines that relieve pain and swelling cause the body to hold onto water. Too much water in the body may create kidney problems and raise blood pressure.</p>



<p>Examples of these medications include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Indomethacin (Indocin).</li>



<li>Medicines available without a prescription such as aspirin (multiple doses a day), naproxen sodium (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others).</li>



<li>Piroxicam (Feldene).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Cold medicines, also called decongestants</strong></h3>



<p>Decongestants make blood vessels smaller, which makes it harder for blood to flow through the blood vessels. Sometimes that raises blood pressure. Decongestants also may make some blood pressure medicines not work as well.</p>



<p>Examples of decongestants include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed 24 Hour).</li>



<li>Phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Antidepressants</strong></h3>



<p>Antidepressants work by changing the body's response to brain chemicals that affect mood. These chemicals also may raise blood pressure.</p>



<p>Examples of antidepressants that can raise blood pressure include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</li>



<li>Tricyclic antidepressants.</li>



<li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Birth control with hormones</strong></h3>



<p>Birth control pills and some birth control devices contain hormones. These hormones may raise blood pressure by making some blood vessels smaller, which makes it harder for blood to flow. Most birth control pills, patches and other devices carry warnings that high blood pressure may be a side effect. The risk of high blood pressure is higher if you're older than 35, overweight or a smoker.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Caffeine</strong></h3>



<p>Caffeine can cause a short-term spike in blood pressure in people who don't use it all the time. It helps to keep blood vessels open, which allows blood to flow easily and may raise blood pressure for a short period of time. There isn't enough evidence to prove that caffeine raises blood pressure long term, though.</p>



<p>Examples of medicines and products with caffeine include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Caffeine pills (Vivarin, NoDoz, others).</li>



<li>Coffee.</li>



<li>Energy drinks and other beverages.</li>
</ul>



<p>The amount of caffeine in coffee varies widely, so it's difficult to say how many cups of coffee you can safely drink a day. Check your blood pressure about 30 minutes before and about 30 minutes after drinking a cup of coffee or another beverage that has caffeine. If your blood pressure goes up by 5 to 10 points, you may be sensitive to caffeine's effect on blood pressure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Herbal supplements</strong></h3>



<p>Herbal supplements may not be safe just because they're natural. Check with your healthcare team before taking any herbal supplements. You may need to avoid supplements that raise your blood pressure or make your blood pressure medicines less effective.</p>



<p>Examples of herbal supplements that may affect your blood pressure or blood pressure medicines include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Arnica (Arnica montana).</li>



<li>Ephedra (ma-huang).</li>



<li>Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius, Panax ginseng).</li>



<li>Guarana (Paullinia cupana).</li>



<li>Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Biological therapies</strong></h3>



<p>Powerful medicines used in biological therapies can have side effects. One of those side effects is high blood pressure. Some of these medicines target specific cells. Others use the body's own immune system to fight some autoimmune diseases and cancers.</p>



<p>Angiogenesis inhibitors and some monoclonal antibodies may raise blood pressure. Examples of these medicines include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bevacizumab (Avastin).</li>



<li>Gefitinib (Iressa).</li>



<li>Imatinib (Gleevec).</li>



<li>Pazopanib (Votrient).</li>



<li>Ramucirumab (Cyramza).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Immunosuppressants</strong></h3>



<p>Most people who've had an organ transplant take immunosuppressants. These medicines help keep the body from rejecting the new organ. Some immunosuppressants can raise blood pressure. This may be due to the ways immunosuppressants affect the kidneys.</p>



<p>Examples of immunosuppressants that can raise blood pressure include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune).</li>



<li>Tacrolimus (Astagraf XL, Prograf, Envarsus XR).</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Stimulants</strong></h3>



<p>Stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin, others), can cause the heart to beat faster or unevenly. This may raise blood pressure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>A caution on illegal drugs</strong></h3>



<p>Illegal drugs can raise blood pressure. They may narrow the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This raises heart rate and damages heart muscle.</p>



<p>Examples of illegal drugs that may affect your heart include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Amphetamines, including methamphetamine.</li>



<li>Cocaine.</li>



<li>Ecstasy (MDMA).</li>
</ul>



<p>If you're using illegal drugs, it's important to stop. Ask your healthcare professional for information on counseling or drug treatment programs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Next steps</strong> <strong>about medications and your blood pressure</strong></h3>



<p>Talk with your healthcare professional if you have concerns about the medications or supplements you're using affecting your blood pressure. Have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If your blood pressure goes up or isn't well controlled, ask about other medications or supplements you can take. Your healthcare team may recommend lifestyle changes or additional medications to control your high blood pressure.</p>

<p>A normal heart rhythm should beat like a steady drum. Atrial fibrillation is like a chaotic drumbeat.</p>



<p>"It's a bum, bum-bum, bum-bum-bum, bum-bum- bum-bum-bum. So what you're having is you're having heartbeats that are going sooner or shorter — bum-bum — or longer — bum-bum-bum, bum. And what that's doing is it's altering the ability of your heart to fill and your heart to pump blood effectively," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/desimone-christopher-v-m-d-ph-d/bio-20209047?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/desimone-christopher-v-m-d-ph-d/bio-20209047?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Christopher DeSimone</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.</p>



<p>That can put patients at greater risk of blood clots, heart failure and stroke.</p>



<p>"The heart is like a house. You have the upstairs, you have the downstairs, and you have electricity going on at the top of the heart. And it's coordinated to beat and pump in a fashion so that blood gets to the rest of your body by going from the top, down through the middle of the heart, out to the bottom of the heart into the basement. The top chambers of the heart are where the problem lies for atrial fibrillation," says Dr. DeSimone.</p>



<p>There are many causes, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or even sleep apnea. Often patients are unaware they have atrial fibrillation.</p>



<p>"Sometimes they'll describe to me that they feel fatigued. They're more short of breath. They feel like they're getting older. They feel like they haven't been as active. But really what they're feeling is not effective blood pumping," says Dr. DeSimone.</p>



<p>Treatment is individualized for each patient and may include medication; administering an electrical shock to the heart; or a procedure called catheter ablation, which scars the heart tissue that's creating the erratic signals.</p>

<p>For much of his life, Mark Kocak kept in great shape, lifting weights, doing aerobics and yoga, all while being an avid runner. But as he approached his 60s, Mark found himself dealing with high LDL (or “bad”) <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>. His primary care doctor recommended he go on a statin, but Mark refused, until one day, “I felt a little weird and thought maybe I was having a heart attack,” Mark says. Though the episode was a false alarm, it served as a wake-up call for Mark.</p>



<p>“My primary doctor, for the last few years, had been recommending I go to a cardiologist because of my high cholesterol and things like that, and I'd been kind of kicking the can down the road,” says Mark, now 62 and recently retired from teaching health and physical education at a junior high school in southwest Minnesota. “But when I had that scare with my heart, I decided I better see one. And I knew right away where I wanted to go, and that was Mayo Clinic.”</p>



<p>At Mayo, Mark came under the care of preventive cardiologist <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vasile-vlad-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20513797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vlad Vasile, M.D.</a>, Ph.D., co-director of Mayo’s Clinical Specialty Laboratory, who recommended he undergo ceramide testing. A novel assay developed at Mayo, ceramide testing can reveal more about heart disease and stroke risk than standard lipid tests. Ceramides are sphingolipids, found everywhere in our body. Though they are “ubiquitously expressed,” the test focuses primarily on three ceramides of cardiovascular interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The beauty of these three ceramides is they’re involved in different pathways,” says Dr. Vasile, who also serves as medical director of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-health-clinic/overview/ovc-20442224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s Cardiovascular Health Clinic</a>. “All of them are involved in plaque formation. Some reflect inflammation, some reflect the bad cholesterol, and some reflect coagulation or thickening of the blood.”</p>



<p>Jeff Meeusen, Ph.D., who co-directs Mayo’s Clinical Specialty Laboratory alongside Dr. Vasile, believes ceramides to be “a very biologically active group” of signal molecules. “So, whereas cholesterol is more or less a scaffolding, a building block that the cells can use to make other things, these ceramides seem to be specific actors in these different roles,” he says. “When they’re imbalanced they seem to have a stronger physiological signal that informs our ceramide test.”</p>



<p><strong>Moving beyond the gray area of risk calculators</strong></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic’s ceramide test uses liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technology to sort through complex molecular compounds and render an algorithmic score — a simple number that places the patient in a “bucket” of risk. For clinicians, it’s easy to interpret because this number is correlated with one of four risk categories, from low to very high risk. The test is also available to physicians outside of Mayo Clinic; one need only send in a patient’s blood specimen to receive their ceramide score.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“I WOULD SAY ABOUT HALF OF OUR CERAMIDE TEST ORDERS ARE EXTERNAL AND THE OTHER HALF ARE FROM MAYO CLINIC PHYSICIANS,” DR. MEEUSEN SAYS. “BUT BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONLY CENTER OFFERING THIS TEST RIGHT NOW, VERY FEW PHYSICIANS KNOW ABOUT IT. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE’S QUITE A BIT OF LITERATURE BUILDING UP IN ITS SUPPORT.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When Mark came to Dr. Vasile, besides high cholesterol, he also had stage 1 <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20045868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension</a>.</p>



<p>“His LDL level was 137, which was not really at goal,” Dr. Vasile says. “And he has a family history of premature coronary artery disease in first-degree relatives, so I ran the ASCVD calculator (a tool that estimates a patient’s 10-year risk of heart attack), which put him in a gray area of intermediate risk.”</p>



<p>Cardiologists like Dr. Vasile also use chest imaging and traditional blood tests to indicate coronary artery disease risk factors. But even this testing is limited, as are current risk calculators.</p>



<p>“We’re looking at many, many things, not just one parameter,” Dr. Vasile says. “With these calculators, we plug in all these clinical parameters, like blood data such as cholesterol, the demographics of the patient, and these calculators render a certain risk for developing heart attacks and strokes within a certain time span. But we know very well that these calculators are far from being perfect. There is a lot of criticism with such calculators because coronary artery disease and plaque formation are very complex and multifactorial processes.”</p>



<p>Dr. Vasile continues, “So, here’s this patient, Mr. Mark Kocak, who comes to me with a high LDL cholesterol of 137 mg/dL and a strong family history of heart disease. He’s also at higher risk because he’s a male. Should I target for him an LDL of less than 100, or should I be more aggressive and target an LDL of less than 70? The ASCVD risk calculator was not very helpful in this situation because it ignores family history completely, and so I needed more information.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Targeting LDL numbers to fit the individual</strong></h2>



<p>This is where ceramide testing becomes invaluable for Dr. Vasile. It’s a tool that helps him push through these gray area scenarios and better individualize treatment plans for patients. Mark’s ceramide score was zero, which placed him at low cardiovascular risk — unlike another patient of Dr. Vasile,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mayocliniclabs.com/2023/08/07/ceramide-testing-helps-reduce-risk-of-heart-attack-stephanie-blendermann/">Stephanie Blendermann</a>, whose score was an 8, which put her at high risk.</p>



<p>“So, his score was in opposition to Mrs. Blendermann’s, who had a high score and a similar family history,” Dr. Vasile says. “This told me that Mr. Kocak’s family history probably doesn’t have a significant influence on him. So, we jointly decided that because his ceramide score was zero, we shouldn’t be as aggressive with him as we were for Mrs. Blendermann, whose LDL we targeted at less than 70 milligrams per deciliter. His score told us we should target an LDL number of less than 100, which is the risk category for the average person walking the street.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Higher LDL levels are correlated with heart attacks and strokes; thus, the lower the LDL, the lower the risk of developing these events down the line. To reduce Mark’s risk and bring his LDL to goal, Dr. Vasile recommended a statin and medication for hypertension.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“WITHOUT THAT CERAMIDE SCORE, I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COMPLETELY SAY, ‘YEAH, I WANT THIS PATIENT’S LDL TO BE BELOW 100 OR BELOW 70,’” DR. VASILE SAYS. “AND TO REACH THAT SPECIFIC GOAL FOR THE LDL, IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS WHAT DOSE OF STATIN YOU ARE ON.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Though his ceramide score put him at low risk, Mark heeded Dr. Vasile’s recommendation to go on meds to further decrease his chances of an event. “If a statin and then a low-dose hypertension pill can keep a heart attack at bay, it’s sort of a no-brainer,” Mark says. “I agreed with him on that, and it was part of our preventative plan.”</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Dr. Vasile also urged Mark to continue his aerobic exercise program, weight training, and yoga, and had him talk with a dietician in Mayo’s Cardiovascular Health Clinic, who recommended he begin following a Mediterranean diet.

<p>As part of his preventative plan, Mark will be re-tested for his ceramide score on follow-up visits with Dr. Vasile so that any change can be caught early, and his treatment adjusted accordingly. Although he resisted taking medications for a time, Mark says, “I've always tried to be proactive. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I think medicine’s trying to head that way, getting in on the front end of preventing things, versus having to deal with the aftermath. But Mayo is just an amazing place, leading the way. My family is really blessed to have a facility like this so close to home.”&nbsp;</p>
