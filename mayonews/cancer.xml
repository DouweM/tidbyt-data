<p>Lorie Kirkman embraces a lifestyle of being on the move. The 38-year-old is a wife and mom to three young daughters who are active in their Northeast Florida community and have a passion for being outdoors.</p>



<p>After working out at her gym one day, Lorie began to feel pain in her back and shoulder. When it became uncomfortable to sit or lay down, and she noticed exhaustion and difficulty sleeping, Lorie went to her local physician for answers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>"My first thought when they told me that I had cancer was: I have three little girls," says Lorie. "I can't have cancer. I have three little girls."</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20352489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor</a> had destroyed multiple areas of bone, including 25% of her T5 vertebrae and nearly 80% at T8. The result was a pathologic fracture with angulation of the spine, which put her at risk of a spinal cord injury and potential paralysis.</p>



<p>Lorie’s care was transferred to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, where a multidisciplinary team could coordinate her care.</p>



<p>"Once I reviewed her imaging, I had a discussion with Lorie and explained the precarious situation that she was in," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/buchanan-ian-a-m-d/bio-20521017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ian Buchanan</a>, a Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon. "We discussed with radiation and medical oncology teams, and we all agreed that we needed to proceed with surgery as the first step, with the explicit understanding being that she would need additional therapies, including radiation and chemotherapy."</p>



<p>Lorie's care team, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/starr-jason-s-d-o/bio-20439448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jason Starr</a>, a medical oncologist, began implementing the subsequent phases of treatment with insights from her surgery.</p>



<p>"Having the expertise and ability for one physician to pick up the phone, speak to an expert, and get real-time recommendations is unique to Mayo Clinic," says Dr. Starr.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Lorie-Kirkman-reading-to-daughters-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378934" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Lorie-Kirkman-reading-to-daughters-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Lorie-Kirkman-reading-to-daughters-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Lorie-Kirkman-reading-to-daughters-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Lorie-Kirkman-reading-to-daughters-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Lorie-Kirkman-reading-to-daughters.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lorie Kirkman reading with her three daughters.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"As physicians, we all go into this profession because we want to help people. An important part of helping patients is getting them back to a good quality of life," says Dr. Buchanan. "When you plan a surgery and interact with a patient, the goals of care have to align with what quality of life means for them."</p>



<p>For Lorie, quality of life means being there for her daughters — bringing them to school events and playing outdoors.</p>



<p>"I want my daughters to see me as their mom," says Lorie. "That was one of my promises to them: I'm still your mom, you're not losing me. I'm still here, I'll be OK. There are things that I have to do. There are doctor's appointments I have to go to. There are medicines that I'm going to have to take and therapies that I'm going to endure."</p>



<p>Lorie returned to the gym — building her strength — got back to playing with her daughters in the yard, and, over the summer, took her family on a kayaking adventure.</p>

<p>"Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of these research efforts so that we have better treatment options and patients can live better, longer, fulfilling lives," says Dr. Starr. "Lorie is doing all the heavy lifting, and we're cheering her on."</p>



<p>She is focused on her family and taking each day as it comes.</p>



<p>"For somebody with currently incurable cancer, it's nice to know that Mayo Clinic is working toward finding other treatments or a cure — that'd be nice," says Lorie. "Because every little girl needs her mama forever."</p>

<p>A team of researchers at Mayo Clinic has discovered that using fluorescent green dye combined with imaging during surgery for soft tissue sarcoma can help surgeons determine what tissue may be at risk of poor healing. This information allows surgeons to change the wound closure to reduce the risk of complications as the patient heals.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/soft-tissue-sarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20377725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soft tissue sarcoma</a>&nbsp;forms in tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures, including muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and the lining of joints. An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=The%20American%20Cancer%20Society's%20estimates,males%20and%206%2C000%20in%20females)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated 13,400 people</a>&nbsp;will be diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma in 2023.&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/fulltext/2021/08000/a_prospective_evaluation_of_intraoperative.7.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More than 30% of people</a>&nbsp;who receive radiation treatment before surgery to remove the cancer experience complications with their surgical wounds.</p>



<p>Patients receive the dye, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/indocyanine-green-interstitial-route-intradermal-route-intravenous-route/description/drg-20155722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indocyanine green</a>,  through an IV during surgery. When paired with imaging, the technology is called intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography. The technique allows surgeons to assess the amount of blood flowing in an area of tissue, called tissue perfusion. A lack of blood flow indicates a potential problem with tissue. Surgeons can then remove any tissue that lacks blood flow.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/monitor-632w-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379511" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/monitor-632w-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/monitor-632w.jpg 632w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Wound closure<br></strong>On the monitor, the surgeon views the incision during surgery. The white color indicates blood flowing to the tissue. If blood flow was insufficient, the monitor would show a dark spot.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"It basically changed our practice," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sherman-courtney-e-m-d/bio-20055611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Courtney Sherman, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic oncologist who led the research. "This technology gave us eyes beyond human eyes — a window into the blood supply to the patient's skin."</p>



<p>The team published its findings in the&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaos/fulltext/2021/05150/intraoperative_indocyanine_green_fluorescence.8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</a>&nbsp;(JAAOS) in May 2021 and in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/fulltext/2021/08000/a_prospective_evaluation_of_intraoperative.7.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Research and Reviews</a>&nbsp;in August 2021.</p>



<p>While the surgical technique isn’t yet in standard use for soft tissue sarcoma care across the U.S., surgeons caring for people with soft tissue sarcoma at Mayo Clinic now regularly use ICG fluorescence angiography.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How wound issues complicate healing for people with soft tissue sarcoma</h2>



<p>Soft tissue sarcoma often affects the arms and legs; surgery is a common treatment. The surgeon usually removes the cancer as well as some healthy tissue around it.</p>



<p>Patients typically receive radiation therapy to shrink the cancer before surgery, says Dr. Sherman. Orthopedic oncologists believe the combination of surgery and radiation&nbsp;<a href="https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7276567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increases the likelihood</a>&nbsp;that a surgeon can remove the cancer without needing to remove the entire limb.</p>



<p>Though modern radiation therapy is significantly more precise than in previous decades, it still may damage healthy cells along with cancer cells. This may lead to infection, or the radiation may destroy the genetic material in healthy cells and cut off blood supply. Over time, tissue that lacks blood supply dies, and the patient may require another surgery to remove this additional tissue.</p>



<p>Treatment for soft tissue sarcoma with radiation therapy followed by surgery has an infection risk of 38% for all patients. The risk of the surgical incision reopening in the same group is 42.3%, says Dr. Sherman.</p>



<p>"Wound healing issues disrupt the patient's treatment," says Dr. Sherman. "Due to wound complications, there has been a lot of 'back to the&nbsp;OR' for patients who have radiation therapy plus surgery for soft tissue sarcoma. It's a big deal if we can keep these patients out of the&nbsp;OR."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic’s research on ICG fluorescence</h2>



<p>In their&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaos/fulltext/2021/05150/intraoperative_indocyanine_green_fluorescence.8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 2021 JAAOS article</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers described their finding that&nbsp;ICG fluorescence&nbsp;angiography could not only predict wound complications for patients who had radiation therapy before surgery but also allow surgeons to make changes during the procedure to reduce the risk of complications. The 23-patient study found that intraoperative ICG fluorescence angiography could predict with a high degree of accuracy where complications with wound healing might occur, particularly for patients with soft tissue sarcoma in the lower extremities of the body (from the hip down).</p>



<p>For the&nbsp;AAOS&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/fulltext/2021/08000/a_prospective_evaluation_of_intraoperative.7.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Research and Reviews</a>&nbsp;article in August 2021, Dr. Sherman and the research team reported on a study conducted between October 2017 and September 2019 based on records for patients who received surgery for soft tissue sarcoma with ICG fluorescence angiography. The researchers compared these patients' experiences to those of patients who had received surgery without&nbsp;ICG&nbsp;fluorescence angiography. The study included 88 patients. Researchers found significantly lower rates of infection and surgical incisions reopening in patients who received ICG&nbsp;angiography compared with patients whose surgery did not include this technology.</p>



<p>"Using&nbsp;ICG&nbsp;green fluorescence is simple, straightforward and effective," says Dr. Sherman. “It’s making recovery less challenging for people with soft tissue sarcoma by reducing complications from surgery."</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;has advanced the development and biomanufacturing of novel therapeutics, called biologics, for cancer and inflammatory conditions into clinical trials.</p>



<p>"My dream has been to develop innovative technologies that go beyond treating symptoms to curing diseases. The ultimate aim is to ensure that these advancements are accessible to all patients in need," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, the Michael S. and Mary Sue Shannon Director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Dr. Allickson is also the Otto Bremer Trust Director, Biomanufacturing and Product Development, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Biomanufacturing uses living organisms to manufacture medicines known as biologics that are made from human sources such as blood and cells. Biologics have shown potential for targeted healing with few side effects.</p>



<p>The biomanufacturing process is like a bridge that moves biologics from the lab into first-in-human clinical trials. From there, Mayo Clinic aims to license these technologies to industry collaborators who can conduct clinical trials and commercialize them, thereby making them accessible to patients worldwide.</p>



<p>"To ensure broad access to new medicines, the most effective approach is to bring them to market," says Dr. Allickson. "We are evaluating the scientific rigor required to scale up the production of new drugs. Additionally, we are establishing a streamlined process for advanced biomanufacturing that incorporates automation. Our goal is to transfer production of the medicines to companies capable of replicating our manufacturing process. This will enable them to advance the technology toward obtaining regulatory approval."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Groundbreaking treatments for cancer</strong></h3>



<p>The Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics has reached several milestones in forwarding cutting edge cell therapies to early-stage clinical trials at Mayo Clinic, including:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing a Mayo Clinic-developed chimeric antigen therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</strong></h3>



<p>Chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/gnc-20405215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(CAR-T cell therapy)</a> is a regenerative immunotherapy in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to recognize and stop cancer. A new CAR-T cell therapy developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is aimed at B cell blood cancers that have returned and no longer respond to treatment. Mayo Clinic in Florida is preparing to biomanufacture this new cancer drug, known as BAFF-R, for a phase 1 clinical trial in early 2024. Dr. Qin is working on additional new CAR-T technologies for treating cancer.</p>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic we firmly believe that biomanufacturing CAR-T cell therapy on-site will expedite this lifesaving treatment to patients," says Dr. Allickson. "Backlogs can occur when cells are sent to an external manufacturer, causing delays that cancer patients can’t afford."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing an experimental cell-based ovarian cancer vaccine.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In this pioneering research led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/knutson-keith-l-ph-d/bio-00026672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keith Knutson, Ph.D.</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, white blood cells are extracted from blood, biomanufactured to become dendritic cells and returned to the patient. Dendritic cells act as crusaders that march through the body, triggering the immune system to halt disease progression. Manufacturing the cells at Mayo Clinic is critical so adjustments can be made for each patient's individual cancer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New biomanufacturing facilities open</strong></h3>



<p>Mayo Clinic is expanding the number of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) facilities needed to manufacture biologic therapies for clinical trials. CGMP facilities are clean rooms where therapeutic agents are manufactured in environments free of contamination and meet Food and Drug Administration specifications for safety, identity, strength, purity and quality.</p>



<p>Three new clean rooms opened recently in Florida. A new CGMP facility in One Discovery Square in Rochester, Minn., is ready to begin operations. Mayo Clinic in Arizona is taking an innovative approach of setting up CGMP clean rooms for 3D printing and 3D bioprinting. Mayo Clinic is among the first academic medical centers to 3D bioprint living cells, bones, or organs.</p>



<p>"What differentiates Mayo Clinic is its ability to 3D bioprint cells with CGMP bioprinters in a CGMP-compliant clean room," says Dr. Allickson. "This unique ability distinguishes us as a leader in this field for which we are gaining increasing recognition for our expertise."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A look ahead to 2024</strong></h2>



<p>The Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics has advanced several cell-based therapies to the process and analytical development stage in preparation for biomanufacturing in 2024. Process development establishes standard operating procedures for manufacturing to ensure an experimental therapy is safe and of consistent quality for testing on humans in clinical trials.</p>



<p>Technologies in process development include:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oncolytic virus for a two-pronged attack on cancer</strong></h3>



<p>The team of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vile-richard-g-ph-d/bio-00027663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Vile, Ph.D</a>., is developing genetically engineered viruses with potential to not only destroy cancer, but also trigger an immune response for a second wave of cancer destruction. This technology, known as oncolytic virus, will be combined with CAR-T cell therapy&nbsp;to target solid tumors in patients with liver cancer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Immune cells to address inflammatory conditions</strong></h3>



<p>Supported by a grant from the Skoll Foundation, researchers are studying immune cells to address inflammatory conditions. They are investigating whether these cells and their secretomes could be possible treatments for inflammatory conditions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lupus/symptoms-causes/syc-20365789" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lupus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. Immune cells defend the body against infection. Secretomes are the healing properties released by cells.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CAR-T cell therapy targeting thyroid cancer, graft-versus-host disease and inflammatory bowel disease</strong></h3>



<p>Groundbreaking technology developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, would expand CAR-T cell therapy beyond blood cancers to solid tumors. This discovery targets thyroid hormone stimulating receptor (TSHR) found on the surface of thyroid cancer tumors. Also in process development is a unique CAR-T cell therapy from Dr. Kenderian' s lab developed from mesenchymal stem cells. It will initially treat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/videos/graft-vs-host-disease-gvhd-mayo-clinic/vid-20433405#:~:text=Marrow%20Transplant%20Division.-,Graft%20vs.,and%20they%20reject%20your%20body." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graft-versus-host disease</a>, a rare complication from a bone marrow transplant, and inflammatory bowel disease.</p>



<p>Dr. Allickson sees an exciting year ahead that will include research and development of Regulatory T-cells, often called "Tregs."&nbsp; Tregs play a critical role in regulating the immune system. They show potential for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colitis</a>&nbsp;in which the body mistakenly attacks healthy cells.</p>



<p>"It's a privilege and an honor to be at Mayo Clinic where we can research and develop promising long-term or permanent solutions for patients with rare and complex disease," says Dr. Allickson.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic researchers make new discoveries, develop first-of-its-kind tools and technologies and constantly improve upon existing ones with the goal to provide the best in healthcare. The following five stories are a round-up of some of the most significant medical research advances at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> over the past year. Discoveries range from harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to detect disease sooner to advancing treatments for rare and complex diseases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/10/11/advancing-ultrasound-microvessel-imaging-and-ai-to-improve-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advancing ultrasound microvessel imaging and AI to improve cancer detection</a></h2>



<p>Tumors consist not only of cancer cells but also a matrix of small blood vessels, or microvessels, that cannot be seen in the images produced by conventional ultrasound machines. To solve this problem, physician-scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/alizad-azra-m-d/bio-00085586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azra Alizad, M.D.</a>, and biomedical engineering scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fatemi-mostafa-ph-d/bio-00086282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostafa Fatemi, Ph.D.</a>, teamed up at Mayo Clinic to design and study a tool that may improve the resolution of ultrasound imaging. As demonstrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, they developed high-resolution ultrasound imaging software, compatible with many ultrasound machines, that could exponentially improve both the detail and quality of images. See the animation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCtLfFbWcEo&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>"If we can visualize and capture the microvessel in the earliest stages of cancer, we can better diagnose and treat it earlier, which improves the outcome for the patient," says Dr. Alizad, who specializes in ultrasound technology for cancer imaging.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/10/11/advancing-ultrasound-microvessel-imaging-and-ai-to-improve-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/19/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-ovarian-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harnessing the immune system to fight ovarian cancer</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic research is biomanufacturing an experimental, cell-based ovarian cancer vaccine and combining it with immunotherapy to study a "one-two punch" approach to halting disease progression in ovarian cancer patients. This research begins with a blood draw from women with advanced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>&nbsp;whose tumors have returned after standard surgery and chemotherapy. White blood cells are extracted from the blood, biomanufactured to become dendritic cells and are returned to the patient. Dendritic cells act as crusaders that march through the body, triggering the immune system to recognize and fight cancer.</p>



<p>"We're building on an earlier phase 1 clinical trial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18962-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that showed promising results</a>&nbsp;in terms of survival after the dendritic cell-based vaccine," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, co-principal investigator and medical oncologist. "Of the 18 evaluable patients in the phase 1 study, 11 had cancer return, but seven of them — 40%&nbsp;— have been cancer-free for almost 10 years. We typically expect 90% of patients in this condition to have the cancer return."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/19/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-ovarian-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic research has developed a new type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</a>&nbsp;aimed at killing B-cell blood cancers that have returned and are no longer responding to treatment. This pioneering technology, designed and developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, killed B-cell tumors grown in the laboratory and tumors implanted in mouse models. The preclinical findings are published in&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00262-023-03537-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy</a>.</p>



<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/11/mayo-clinic-prepares-to-biomanufacture-a-new-car-t-cell-therapy-for-b-cell-blood-cancers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Colonoscopy remains the gold standard in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer. But the procedure has limitations. Some studies suggest that&nbsp;more than half&nbsp;of post-colonoscopy colon cancer cases arise from lesions that were missed at patients’ previous colonoscopies.</p>



<p>"AI, particularly the subset of AI called computer vision, is naturally suited to what we do through the endoscope," says Michael B. Wallace, M.D., who describes himself as a bit of a technology geek.</p>



<p>In 2022, Dr. Wallace&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35304117/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published the results</a>&nbsp;of an international, multicenter study testing the impact of adding AI to routine colonoscopies. His team, which included James East, M.D., a gastroenterologist at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London</a>, as well as researchers from the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Germany and Ireland, found that incorporating AI into colonoscopies reduced the risk of missing polyps by 50%.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/02/03/artificial-intelligence-is-forging-a-new-future-for-gastroenterology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;researchers uncover evidence supporting a shorter treatment time for breast cancer patients in a randomized trial, published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(23)00388-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Oncology</a>. The study compared two separate dosing schedules of pencil-beam scanning proton therapy, the most advanced type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/proton-therapy/about/pac-20384758?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proton therapy</a>&nbsp;known for its precision in targeting cancer cells while preserving healthy tissue to reduce the risk of side effects.</p>



<p>"The study provides the first prospective data supporting the use of shorter-course proton PMRT, including in patients with immediate breast reconstruction, and the first mature results of a randomized trial in the field of breast particle therapy," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mutter-robert-w-m-d/bio-20343551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Mutter, M.D.</a>, a radiation oncologist and physician-scientist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "We can now consider the option of 15 days of therapy with patients based on the similar treatment outcomes observed as the longer conventional course. Of note, the short course actually resulted in reduced skin side effects during and after treatment."&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-mayo-clinic-study-reveals-proton-beam-therapy-may-shorten-breast-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Doctors often use radiation to target cancer cells, but did you know radiation therapy can also provide relief from pain?</p>



<p>"Radiation therapy is typically used in about 50% to 60% of all cancer patients, it's very, very common,” says Dr. Holtzman.</p>



<p>He says high-powered energy eradicates cancer cells, shrinking the tumors and helping to ease agonizing aches.</p>



<p>"Typically, 60% to 80% of patients usually have partial or even complete relief of their pain in two to four weeks,” says Dr. Holtzman.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic is using innovation to streamline the process. Even before patients walk through the door, they undergo a virtual planning scan that was created from a prior CT.</p>



<p>"What that means is patients using a diagnostic scan that was previously obtained, we map out the radiation plan, so we can deliver it quicker and more efficiently to maximize that patient's time and quality of life,” explains Dr. Holtzman.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why you might need palliative radiation therapy</h3>

<li>Improve quality of life.</li>



<li>Shrink tumors to relieve pressure.</li>



<li>Manage bleeding/ulcers.</li>

And as family and friends get together, it's important to show that you care without coming across as insensitive.</p>



<p>Lynne Vitagliano, a clinical social worker at Mayo Clinic, offers some helpful advice to make those uncomfortable conversations less awkward.</p>

<p>Many times, people mean well but don't know the right things to say to someone with cancer.</p>



<p>"Every person is different. So it would be hard to say that there's any one right question to ask or right thing to say. What I think is most important is to convey genuine care and concern," says Vitagliano. "Offer an invitation rather than a question. So to say something along the lines of, 'I've been thinking of you. I know a lot is going on in your life. I'm here if you'd like to talk.'"</p>



<p>Vitagliano says it's also important how you respond. And the best response is simply listening.</p>



<p>"Allow them to talk about their experience without feeling the need to kind of jump in with your own advice or suggestions," she says.</p>



<p>And it's important to show that you care without coming across as insensitive.</p>



<p>"We want to say something that we think is supportive. So we say, 'I'm sure it'll all turn out OK.' Well, we don't know that, and that's not necessarily true. And so, by saying that, it almost invalidates what they've shared with us," Vitagliano says. "It's not as supportive as saying, 'Wow, you've been through so much this year. And I'm just blown away by your strength. What can I do to help?'"</p>

<p>How cancer spreads or metastasizes is a big question for cancer researchers and patients. Mayo Clinic researchers studying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic cancer</a>&nbsp;— the third deadliest form of cancer in the U.S. — recently made a discovery that advances knowledge of how metastasis unfolds. They identified a cell-signaling protein that drives pancreatic cancer cell growth that could be a potential therapeutic target.</p>



<p>"Our ultimate goal is to find the triggers for metastasis and stop it. Combine that with treatments to reduce tumor growth, and we can hopefully improve patient outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/razidlo-gina-ph-d/bio-00096936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gina Razidlo, Ph.D.</a>, the senior author of a paper published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(23)01053-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cell Reports</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking inside the tumor microenvironment</strong></h2>



<p>Tumors grow in nutrient-poor environments, so cancer cells must rewire cellular metabolism to meet their energy needs. One way in which cancer cells hijack metabolic pathways is through lysosomes, which function as the cell's stomach and are filled with digestive enzymes. Lysosomes break down proteins, lipids and nutrients that fuel cells to grow. Previous research has shown that amplified lysosome activity is a hallmark of various forms of cancer.</p>



<p>This knowledge led Dr. Razidlo and lead author Omar Gutierrez Ruiz, Ph.D., to look closely at the characteristics of lysosomes in pancreatic cancer cells driven by mutations in the cancer-producing mutated gene, or oncogene, KRAS. Dr. Gutierrez Ruiz collaborated with the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/core-resources/proteomics-core/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proteomics Core</a> on this project as part of his dissertation, and together, they made an unexpected discovery.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Omar-Gutierrez-Ruiz-vert_3x4-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379071" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Omar-Gutierrez-Ruiz-vert_3x4-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Omar-Gutierrez-Ruiz-vert_3x4-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Omar-Gutierrez-Ruiz-vert_3x4-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Omar-Gutierrez-Ruiz-vert_3x4-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Omar Gutierrez Ruiz, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>They compared the lysosomes from pancreatic cancer cells expressing oncogenic KRAS with lysosomes from cells with healthy KRAS to find out what was different. Among the 52 proteins they found that had changed on the surface of lysosomes in pancreatic cancer cells, one protein called dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) stood out.</p>



<p>DOCK8 creates invasive protrusions that act like little arms that can worm through and change the structure of a cell and degrade its surroundings. DOCK8 is typically found in healthy immune cells where it helps the cells navigate and squeeze through dense tissue, aiding the response to and fight against infection. Surprisingly, Dr. Razidlo, Dr. Gutierrez Ruiz and their collaborators found DOCK8 on lysosomes in pancreatic cancer cells.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does DOCK8 work?</strong></h2>



<p>How cancer cells invade and spread resembles how DOCK8 helps immune cells penetrate tissue. The researchers looked at images and videos of the pancreatic cancer cells, produced in Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-cell-signaling-gastroenterology-c-sig/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Cell Signaling in Gastroenterology</a>. They saw DOCK8 using lysosomes to break down the extracellular environment around the cancer cell — helping it spread.</p>



<p>To confirm that this protein is involved in tumor progression, the team eliminated DOCK8 in pancreatic cancer cells using the gene-editing tool CRISPR. They found in a preclinical model that the DOCK8-depleted lysosomes moved slower, tumor growth slowed and metastasis decreased. Then, they delved further and showed that DOCK8 was present in about 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer whose cells were studied.</p>



<p>"Now that we have found out that DOCK8 is regulating the process of metastasis, it could potentially be a therapeutic target to prevent or stop pancreatic cancer metastasis," says Dr. Gutierrez Ruiz, who graduated from&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>&nbsp;in May.</p>

<p>The most common form of primary <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver cancer</a> — cancer that starts in the liver — is called hepatocellular carcinoma. This type of cancer often develops in people with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis.</p>



<p>"It’s due to a chronic inflammation that leads to liver damage, cirrhosis and eventually to cancer," says Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of liver cancer" class="wp-image-174281" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<p>Most people don't have symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. But when symptoms do appear, they may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Yellowing of the eyes and skin.</li>



<li>Unexpected weight loss.</li>



<li>Upper abdominal pain.</li>



<li>White, chalky stools.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Liver cancer treatments</h3>



<p>Several promising treatments to manage the disease include targeted therapy and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>"Immunotherapy is kind of a novel type of cancer treatment that is designed to boost your immune system to attack the cancer," explains Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>



<p>Eating a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables, limiting alcohol consumption, and getting vaccinated against hepatitis B can reduce your risk of liver cancer.</p>



<p>"The hope is that we can trigger a tumor specific immune response for every patient,” says Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2020, Gary McCracken noticed a swollen lymph node near the upper left side of his neck. He initially didn't think much of it. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"I grew a beard for deer season and forgot all about it," he says with a chuckle.</p>



<p>After Thanksgiving, when Gary shaved his beard, the gland was still swollen. "There's a video of me playing guitar at church, and it looks like I swallowed a baseball," he says.</p>



<p>That's when the Hayward, Wisconsin, resident decided to get checked out.</p>



<p>"I went into the local clinic. The doctor who examined me said it was probably nothing, but I should have a biopsy to be sure," Gary says.</p>



<p>He was sent for a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/needle-biopsy/about/pac-20394749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">needle biopsy</a>. When that biopsy uncovered suspicious cells, Gary was referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist in Duluth for further investigation.</p>



<p>"The ENT said, 'You know, you don't need that gland, so let's just take it out,'" Gary says.</p>



<p>Gary agreed. On Feb. 17, 2021, he had the lymph node removed. Two days later, he received a call that made it clear he was not out of the woods and ultimately would need more specialized care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sharing the news, keeping his faith</strong></h2>



<p>"The doctor said, 'I didn't think I was going to say this, but you have cancer somewhere in your body, and the cells have gotten into your lymph system and shown up in this gland,'" Gary recalls of the day he received the follow-up call.</p>



<p>Despite the heart-wrenching news, Gary put on a brave face for his wife of 42 years and his five children.</p>



<p>"I tried to downplay my diagnosis to my family and say it's not that big of a deal, but we're a close family, and we walked through it together," he says. "I'm also a person of faith, so that carried me through."</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

</blockquote>



<p>Encouraged by his family and his faith, Gary continued to stay positive while he underwent more testing to try to identify the source of the cancer.</p>



<p>His local care team was unable to locate the cancer with imaging. So they sent him to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a> for further examination.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Experiencing the Mayo Clinic magic</strong></h2>



<p>Gary remembers the moment he arrived at Mayo Clinic. Navigating the vast campus seemed daunting initially, but he quickly learned what makes Mayo Clinic magical:&nbsp;<em>the people.</em></p>



<p>"The people there are so helpful. It's just so astounding how accommodating they are to go out of their way to help visitors navigate and feel at ease," Gary says. "It makes for such a positive and wonderful experience from the minute you walk in."</p>



<p>But Gary's gratitude for Mayo Clinic extends far beyond the warm welcome he received when he got to campus. Specialists worked together to uncover the source of Gary's cancer and treat it.</p>



<p>Gary was seen by the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (ENT) Oropharynx Multidisciplinary Clinic team, including specialists in medical oncology, radiation oncology, dentistry and speech therapy, within one day of arriving at Mayo Clinic. Then he went to the operating room where <a href="https://quarterly.mayo.edu/directory/person/person.htm?per_id=11437456&amp;search_criteria_display=%27Moore%27+%27Eric%27+">Eric Moore, M.D.</a>, chair of Otorhinolaryngology, and supervisor-physician assistant Eliot Martin, performed exploratory robotic surgery.</p>



<p>"They explained that they would take a scope down my throat and start collecting pieces of tissue to send to Pathology while I was still under," Gary says. "And they would do this until they found the cancer."</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It was the best possible outcome. We had a touching, tearful moment there. I was lying in the hospital bed, both specialists were there — it was really wonderful. </p>
<cite>Gary McCracken</cite></blockquote>



<p>It didn't take long for them to find the source. Located in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/head-and-neck-cancer-center/home/orc-20457069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tonsil tissue</a> at the back of Gary's tongue was a cancerous, pea-sized tumor.</p>



<p>"It was so small that it didn't show up on any of the scans I had before coming to Mayo Clinic," Gary says. "Once they found it, they cut me from ear to Adam's apple and took out the remaining 39 lymph nodes on the left side of my neck."</p>



<p>When Gary came out of anesthesia, his team told him the news: They not only successfully found and removed the cancerous tumor, but he also would not need chemotherapy or radiation.</p>



<p>"It was the best possible outcome. We had a touching, tearful moment there. I was lying in the hospital bed, both specialists were there — it was really wonderful," Gary says.</p>



<p>"My wife and I are just so thrilled with the compassion and care of everyone involved, from the doctors to the nurses who would come in at night," he says. "Such a big part is to keep a positive outlook to fight whatever you're going through, and they just helped so much with that."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Recovering and looking forward to his future</strong></h2>



<p>Gary says life has been "surprisingly effortless" since recovering from surgery. He was home within a few days of the procedure and had complete function after a few weeks.</p>



<p>"I was eating fairly quickly and had very little pain," Gary says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that he's fully recovered, he plans to make the most of every day he has left. To him, that means traveling around the country with his wife to visit his children, who are relieved their dad is cancer-free.</p>



<p>"When I called and told them I was free and clear, there was this wonderful euphoria," Gary says. "My daughter said, 'This could have been the worst year of our lives, and it ended up being a pretty good summer.'"</p>



<p>Gary agrees.</p>



<p>The cherry on top of a good summer? A three-day backpacking trip to Goat Rocks Wilderness in the Cascade Mountain range of Western Washington with Thomas, his second-born son.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Gary-McCracken_3-16x9-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378722" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Gary-McCracken_3-16x9-1.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Gary-McCracken_3-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Gary-McCracken_3-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>"We did some camping when our kids were younger, and when Thomas moved to Portland, he got into backpacking," Gary says. "I started traveling out there yearly to go with him, but we had to skip a few times because of the pandemic."</p>



<p>With cancer behind him, Gary has a deeper appreciation for these adventures and the everyday moments in his life.</p>



<p>"It really is true what people say after they experience something like this — the sun shines brighter; the birds sing louder," Gary says. "Everything feels so good and rich and valuable."</p>

For people at high risk, flu complications can include pneumonia, heart problems and acute respiratory distress syndrome. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pneumonia</a> is one of the most serious complications as it can be deadly for older adults and people with a chronic illness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>What is the flu?</strong></h2>



<p>What many people call the flu is actually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/viral-gastroenteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378847?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viral gastroenteritis</a>, or stomach flu, which is characterized by diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramps and pain.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Influenza</a>&nbsp;is the true flu. It's a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system, including your nose, throat and lungs.</p>



<p>At first, flu may seem like a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common cold</a>, with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. But while colds usually develop slowly, flu tends to come on suddenly. And although a cold can be a bother, you usually feel much worse with flu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>How to keep yourself healthy</strong></h2>



<p>Unlike the common cold and stomach flu, there is a vaccine for flu. While it's not 100% effective, getting vaccinated for flu can reduce your risk of becoming infected with flu, and lessen its severity and lower your risk of hospitalization if you are infected.</p>



<p>In addition to vaccination, it's also important to take several measures to reduce the spread of infection, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wash your hands.</strong><br>Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is an effective way to prevent many common infections. Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers if soap and water aren't available.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid touching your face.</strong><br>Specifically, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to prevent spreading viruses.</li>



<li><strong>Cover your coughs and sneezes.</strong><br>Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.</li>



<li><strong>Clean surfaces.</strong><br>Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid crowds.</strong><br>The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings, auditoriums and public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you reduce your chances of infection.</li>
