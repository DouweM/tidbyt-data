<p>"With the robotic approach, we believe that the incisions are smaller, the recoveries quicker and less pain," says Dr. Fong.</p>



<p>During surgery, Dr. Fong looks into a 3D camera while guiding the robot from a console.</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Candidate for robotic Whipple surgery</h3>



<p>The best candidate for the surgery depends on the person and the cancer.</p>



<p>"Typically, patients have a lower BMI and the pancreatic cancers that don't involve the main visceral vessels that passes through the pancreas," says Dr. Fong.</p>



<p>If you have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, your healthcare team will talk with you about treatment options. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">More about pancreatic cancer</h3>



<p>Pancreatic cancer usually doesn't show symptoms until it's advanced. </p>



<p>Treatment options for pancreatic cancer depend on the type, stage, and other factors and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or a combination of these.</p>

<p>Bile duct cancer, also known as cholangiocarcinoma, forms in the thin tubes that carry bile from your liver to your gallbladder and small intestine. Though relatively rare, cholangiocarcinoma is often diagnosed in later stages, making it more difficult to treat, and cases in the U.S. are increasing.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-023-00770-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review article</a>&nbsp;published in Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology in 2023, lead author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ilyas-sumera-i-m-b-b-s/bio-20258409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sumera I. Ilyas, M.B.B.S.</a>, and co-authors share advances in diagnosing, staging and treating bile duct cancer. Dr. Ilyas is a Mayo Clinic physician-scientist and a transplant hepatologist whose&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ilyas-sumera-i-m-b-b-s/bio-10031656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;focuses on the immunobiology of liver cancer. Here is a summary of their review:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The immune microenvironment of bile duct tumors promotes their growth.</h2>



<p>Dr. Ilyas says bile duct cancers have distinct tumor immune microenvironments (TIMEs). Researchers have begun to understand the complexity of these TIMEs and their relationship with the three different types of cholangiocarcinoma —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intrahepatic, hilar and distal</a>. The TIMEs of bile duct cancer have fewer cytotoxic cells — immune cells that help kill mutated and cancerous cells— and more cells that suppress the immune system. TIMEs may affect how the disease progresses and whether it can be treated with immunotherapy.</p>



<p>The genetic profile of different segments of bile duct tumors can also vary, known as heterogeneity. This makes it more challenging to target characteristics of the tumor for treatment.</p>



<p>Researchers are trying to understand how TIMEs help bile duct cancer grow and progress, evade the immune system and resist chemotherapy. Altering the TIME could make treatments more effective, &nbsp;including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune checkpoint inhibitors</a>&nbsp;and other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunotherapy</a>&nbsp;treatments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blood and bile samples may help diagnose bile duct cancer earlier.</h2>



<p>Diagnosing bile duct cancer early, when it's easier to treat, is a challenge. This is partly because cancer experts don't yet have the right tests and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/biomarker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biomarkers</a>&nbsp;to detect cholangiocarcinoma. "Efforts to identify better biomarkers to help diagnose the disease at an early stage and help gauge response to treatment are important," explains Dr. Ilyas. "Currently, there is a great deal of ongoing research focused on the use of tumor DNA in diagnosing and monitoring cholangiocarcinoma in patients receiving treatment."</p>



<p>Dr. Ilyas says research has identified potential biomarkers for cholangiocarcinoma. Researchers are now studying how biomarkers obtained through blood and bile samples from patients can help improve cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis. They are also looking for ways to detect and monitor tumors using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/liquid-biopsy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquid biopsies</a>, which use DNA that breaks away from the tumor to circulate in bodily fluids like blood or bile. "Although we anticipate that liquid biopsy may enhance early detection of cholangiocarcinoma, larger scale studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bile duct cancer treatments are improving.</h2>



<p>"Systemic treatment options for cholangiocarcinoma were once quite limited and not very effective," says Dr. Ilyas. Systemic therapies are drugs used to treat cancer, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted therapy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunotherapy</a>.</p>



<p>Targeted therapies are drugs targeting mutations that control how cancer cells grow, divide and spread. With a better understanding of the different genetic profiles of bile duct cancer subtypes, cancer experts are developing new treatments tailored to specific types of cholangiocarcinoma. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several new drugs that target specific genetic mutations associated with bile duct tumor growth. "The emergence of targeted therapies has broadened treatment options and, in doing so, given much more hope to our patients," says Dr. Ilyas.</p>



<p>Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system to attack cancer. While immunotherapy has not yet proven effective for treating cholangiocarcinoma, Dr. Ilyas says ongoing research to identify biomarkers and to understand why bile duct cancer doesn't respond to immunotherapy may improve outcomes.</p>



<p>Researchers are also studying liver transplants as a treatment option for cholangiocarcinoma in select patients with certain tumor types. However, Dr. Ilyas says this form of treatment needs further research.</p>

<p>For 10 years, the Welsh-born farmer and craftsman has been fighting <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>: a cancer that affects plasma cells which produce disease- and infection-fighting antibodies.</p>



<p>In multiple myeloma, cancerous plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow and crowd out healthy blood cells. Rather than produce helpful antibodies, the cancer cells produce abnormal proteins that can cause bone pain, fractures, kidney failure and other complications.</p>



<p>"I've struggled and carried on fighting this disease as well as trying to survive," John says.</p>

<p>He went through chemotherapy and stem cell transplants in the U.K., but his cancer was relentless. In 2021, after another failed treatment, John began looking for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20353386?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">options</a> in other countries.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ailawadhi-sikander-m-d/bio-20087330?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sikander Ailawadhi</a>, a hematologist and oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, kept coming up in his research. John took a chance and sent an email.</p>



<p>"Whatever it takes, if I have to come across the ocean, whenever they want me, I will do it," John says.</p>



<p>After crossing the Atlantic Ocean and meeting with a team at Mayo, John learned he was a candidate for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy</a>, or CAR-T. The personalized treatment collects a patient's T cells, which normally help fight off infections, and genetically engineers them to target cancer cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Florida became John's home for months as his cells were collected and prepared. In March 2022, his modified cells were infused back into his body. His cancer went into remission.</p>

<p>"Being able to go back to his life in that state of remission, spending time with his sons, thinking of going back to work if he wanted to, thinking of living his life — I think that was the No. 1 thing that it did for him," says Dr. Ailawadhi.</p>



<p>John spent months at home in remission, but his cancer was detected during a follow-up appointment. However, his story doesn't end there.</p>



<p>While John had been undergoing CAR-T and, later, in remission, new clinical trials became available in the U.K. He started care locally and is monitored closely by his Mayo team from Florida and London. John hopes to inspire others to keep searching for treatments and put up the best fight against their disease.</p>



<p>"I'm just looking to be happy," says John. "And basically, try and help somebody else. Because that gives me power to be able to see somebody benefit the way that I have."</p>

<p>Many women often don't show any signs of cervical cancer in the early stages of the disease. In advanced stages, symptoms may include vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or pain during intercourse.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/butler-kristina-a-m-d-m-s/bio-20110364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kristina Butler</a>, a Mayo Clinic gynecologic oncologist, explains why preventive screenings are crucial.</p>

<p>Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cells of the cervix. Women who have been exposed to HPV are most at risk. Routine Pap smears or HPV screenings can help detect precancerous cells.</p>



<p>"We recommend cervical cancer screening start at age 21 for most women and continue thereafter about every three to five years, depending on the type of screening that's performed. Annual pelvic exams are offered in the years a Pap smear is not due," says Dr. Butler.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cervical cancer screening recommendations for older women</h3>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women receive a Pap smear until age 65.</p>



<p>"We do know that 16% of cervical cancers happen in women above the age of 65," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>She says it's important for women with high risk factors or postmenopausal women to continue regular screenings.</p>



<p>"Particularly if a woman has abnormal bleeding, or any bleeding after menopause, it's very relevant to be evaluated," explains Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>Practicing safe sex and getting the HPV vaccine can reduce your risk of cervical cancer. People can get vaccinated between the ages of 9 and 45.</p>

<p>There are several <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> subtypes. The growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer, the most common subtype, is driven by female hormones. Another common subtype, HER2-positive breast cancer, has excessive copies of a gene called HER2 that makes its cells grow more than they should.</p>



<p>Triple-negative breast cancer, also called basal-like breast cancer, is a subtype that isn't affected by hormones or the HER2 gene. It grows rapidly, is more likely to spread beyond the breast before diagnosis and is more likely to recur than other breast cancers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20340746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20340746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon Ferre, M.D</a>.</a>, a Mayo Clinic oncologist whose research focuses on triple-negative breast cancer, says recent advances are improving treatment outcomes for people with this disease. "This subtype represents about 15% of all breast cancers," says Dr. Leon Ferre.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>"It's a bit more common at younger ages and in African American women, Hispanic women and women of Indian descent. We also see this subtype more commonly in women who have a genetic mutation predisposing them to breast cancer — the BRCA1 mutation, in particular."</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">ROBERTO LEON FERRE, M.D.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre and other researchers at Mayo Clinic are working to understand how triple-negative breast cancer grows and spreads, how the immune system may recognize and fight it, and to develop new treatments for the disease. If you've been diagnosed with this breast cancer subtype, here’s what you should know:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is triple-negative breast cancer?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/roberto-leon-ferre-15303209-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379817" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/roberto-leon-ferre-15303209-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/roberto-leon-ferre-15303209.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Roberto Leon Ferre, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We do three tests on every breast cancer tumor to help us select treatment: The estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2. If those three tests are negative, the cancer is considered triple-negative breast cancer," says Dr. Leon Ferre.</p>



<p>Confirming a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer starts with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-biopsy/about/pac-20384812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biopsy</a>, a procedure to remove a sample of breast tissue for testing. Your care team will send your tissue to the laboratory for analysis to determine cell type, aggressiveness (grade) and whether the cancer cells have hormone receptors.</p>



<p>Hormone receptors are proteins that can attach to a specific hormone. Some breast cancer cells have receptors for the female hormone estrogen and need it to grow. These breast cancers can be treated with anti-estrogen hormone (endocrine) therapy to block their growth.</p>



<p>The lab will also analyze your cancer cells' genetic makeup to determine if they are HER2-positive or have other tumor markers. HER2-positive cancers have too many copies of the HER2 gene, which causes them to produce too much of the HER2 growth-promoting protein. These breast cancers can be treated with drugs that target the HER2 protein in cancer cells to slow those cells' growth and kill them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is triple-negative breast cancer treated?</h2>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre says that for some types of breast cancer, chemotherapy is used after surgery and sometimes not at all. This is not the case for triple-negative breast cancer. "The vast majority of women with this diagnosis will need chemotherapy, and we almost always treat with chemotherapy before surgery," he says.</p>



<p>With other breast cancers, chemotherapy is given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast.</p>



<p>"Triple-negative breast cancer tends to spread at a microscopic level from the beginning," says Dr. Leon Ferre. This means the cancer must be treated with&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2021/12/16/the-4-types-of-systemic-therapy-for-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">systemic therapy</a>&nbsp;— a drug or combination of drugs that can be taken orally or through an IV to reach cancer cells in all parts of the body. "The drugs usually used to avoid chemotherapy target estrogen receptors. This cancer doesn't have those, so we rely on chemotherapy, which essentially kills any cell that is dividing rapidly," he says.</p>



<p>Another systemic therapy used to treat triple-negative breast cancer is&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/11/29/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-immunotherapy-for-people-with-triple-negative-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunotherapy</a>, drugs that help your immune system identify and kill cancer cells. "At this time, it's the only type of breast cancer for which we use immunotherapy. Of all breast cancer subtypes, it's the one that's better able to alert the immune system to its presence. We can take advantage of that and use medications to activate the immune system further to attack the cancer," says Dr. Leon Ferre.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">ROBERTO LEON FERRE, M.D.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The immunotherapy approved for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer is called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/pembrolizumab-intravenous-route/description/drg-20122552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pembrolizumab</a>. It can be used with chemotherapy or other medicines before surgery and then continued alone after surgery to treat early stage, triple-negative breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. It can also treat triple-negative breast cancer that produces the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/pd-l1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PD-L1 protein</a>&nbsp;and cannot be surgically removed.</p>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic testing</a>&nbsp;can identify additional treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer. "There are some medications that work only in people that have certain genetic mutations, so it's important to ask for genetic testing — even if you don't have a family history of breast cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What should I ask my care team about triple-negative breast cancer?</h2>



<p>Before deciding on a treatment plan, Dr. Leon Ferre recommends asking your care team these questions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>What is the goal of my treatment?</strong><br>He says everyone diagnosed with cancer should ask their care team this question. "It's important to know if treatments are likely to cure the cancer or if treatment will be about controlling the cancer."</li>



<li><strong>Are clinical trials an option?<br></strong>If available treatments are unlikely to achieve a cure, consider clinical trials. "There have been many advances in triple-negative breast cancer research, and there are a lot of newer medications that work against this cancer," he says. Participating in a&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/05/23/is-a-cancer-clinical-trial-right-for-me/">clinical trial</a>&nbsp;may provide treatment options you may not otherwise have.</li>



<li><strong>Is immunotherapy an option?</strong><br>Immunotherapy can treat cancer by blocking immune checkpoints, the part of the immune system that prevents an immune response from being so strong that it destroys a body’s healthy cells. Dr. Leon Ferre says you should ask about immunotherapy if your care team doesn't mention it. Depending on the situation, you may need a test called PD-L1 to decide if immunotherapy would be a good option.</li>



<li><strong>What are the possible side effects of treatment?</strong><br>Before deciding on a treatment plan, it's crucial to understand the side effects of any treatment. "Understanding the potential side effects will help you anticipate how you will feel and prepare beforehand. Every cancer patient should ask about treatment side effects," he says.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are new treatments being developed for triple-negative breast cancer?</h2>



<p>Researchers are studying several new types of immunotherapy with the potential to treat triple-negative breast cancer. "These therapies are promising, and because they work differently than the immunotherapy now available, they are likely to help patients that do not qualify for that drug," says Dr. Leon Ferre. "We also have made progress in a class of drugs called antibody-drug conjugates. These treatments link a small amount of chemotherapy to modified antibodies — naturally occurring proteins that help fight infections. The antibodies have been modified to recognize specific portions of the tumor, instead of bacteria or viruses, and are attached to a small dose of chemotherapy. This allows chemotherapy delivery to tumor cells while sparing cells that aren’t cancerous. These drugs seem to be more potent than traditional chemotherapy."</p>



<p>Researchers have also made advances in the development of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted therapies</a>&nbsp;for triple-negative breast cancer. These drugs target proteins that control how cancer cells grow, divide and spread. "These treatments are for patients with certain genetic mutations — some targeted therapies specifically block those mutations," says Dr. Leon Ferre. "Some of these drugs are oral and have fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy. So, we may be able to treat some patients with targeted-drug therapies and perhaps have phases of treatment where they don't need chemotherapy. These drugs can be much better tolerated and usually don't cause nausea or hair loss."</p>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre and his colleagues at Mayo Clinic are conducting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/search-results?keyword=triple-negative%20breast%20cancer&amp;studySiteStatusesGrouped=Open%2FStatus%20Unknown#0c1d955fe5494ae68c25c6f1aad733c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trials</a>&nbsp;of targeted therapies for triple-negative breast cancer. "We're working on ways to identify patients that may do well with less or no chemotherapy. We're finding immune markers that may allow us to identify patients with early stage cancer with such a good prognosis that they may need less intensive chemotherapy."</p>

</blockquote>



<p>If you've been diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, Dr. Leon Ferre wants you to know that it's treatable. "It's very sensitive to chemotherapy. With the incorporation of immunotherapy and some newer drugs, we're seeing higher cure rates for patients with early stage breast cancer. And we have new treatments for patients with metastatic breast cancer. We're making a lot of progress."</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center and Columbia University recently announced being named  the recipients of a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-columbia-university-receive-10-6-million-grant-from-nci-to-advance-glioblastoma-research-with-mathematical-oncology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$10.6 million grant from the National Cancer</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-columbia-university-receive-10-6-million-grant-from-nci-to-advance-glioblastoma-research-with-mathematical-oncology/"> Institute</a> to advance research in fighting glioblastoma - one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms of brain cancer. </p>



<p>Every year, thousands are diagnosed with the disease. Many are given little time to live. The prognosis is often poorer for older patients.</p>



<p>Researchers are searching for a cure. Meanwhile a team at Mayo Clinic is also looking for ways to help elderly patients diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-is-glioblastoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a> live longer and maintain quality of life. </p>



<p>Now, an investigational study at Mayo Clinic using an innovative approach to treatment has shown promise in improving health outcomes for people like Richard Casper.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Love at first sight</h2>



<p>Richard and Carol Casper were in their early 20s when they met. Carol was smitten, but not sure Richard would call her again.</p>



<p>"So, anyway, he did," recalls Carol with a twinkle in her eye. "That's where it all started in 1962, and we got married in 1964." </p>



<p>Children soon followed, and their family began traveling the world with Richard's career in the U.S. Air Force.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-802x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378587" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-802x1024.png 802w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-235x300.png 235w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-768x981.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM.png 844w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Richard and Carol on their wedding day in 1964</strong>                                                                                                                                                 Photo courtesy: Casper family</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The day their world changed&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After nearly 30 years of military service, the couple was looking forward to retirement. Then suddenly, in 2019, Richard suffered a seizure and their world came crashing down. Testing began to identify the cause of his seizures. </p>



<p>Ultimately surgery confirmed the family's worst fear - brain cancer.</p>



<p>"That's when we got the definite diagnosis that it was <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-is-glioblastoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma, stage 4,</a>" says Carol. Doctors told the family Richard had less than a year to live.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We were hit with a bomb."</p><cite>Carol Casper, Richard's wife</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Glioblastoma: The deadliest form of brain cancer&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Glioblastoma is one of the most complex and fast-growing forms of brain cancer. It is also the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, though it can strike at any age. It can form in the spinal cord or the brain.</p>



<p>"It carries the worst prognosis, and it has to do with the aggressiveness of the cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist with Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona. "Despite our best treatments, we see patients continue to recur, which requires additional treatments over time." &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://braintumor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Brain Tumor Society</a>, more than 14,490 Americans are expected to be diagnosed in 2023. They estimate approximately 10,000 will die from the disease.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research to improve patient outcomes</h2>



<p>Dr. Vora has been researching brain tumors and ways to improve patient outcomes for the past two decades. His team is now investigating an innovative treatment protocol for elderly patients, like Richard, who are often given less time than average to live. </p>



<p>"Most of these patients are in the six- to nine-month range," says Dr. Vora. "We're looking for ways of providing more effective and better treatments for patients in terms of both quality and quantity of life."</p>



<p>Richard sought treatment at Mayo Clinic in Arizona under the care of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-alyx-b-m-d/bio-20055164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alyx Porter, M.D</a>., a neuro-oncologist. "When people come in, it is one of the scariest times in their life," says Dr. Porter. "My job is to provide them with comfort, reassurance and direction as to what the next steps will be."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic's multidisciplinary approach</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic's healthcare model is based on a team approach. Physicians from a variety of disciplines work together to explore the best treatment options for a patient and deliver the highest level of care.</p>



<p>Richard's family was aware there was likely no cure. What&nbsp;they wanted was more time than his prognosis.&nbsp;His healthcare team agreed Richard was an ideal candidate for the clinical trial. Richard told doctors he was ready to be a participant.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Sign me up. I just need to get my balance back, and I think I'll be able to roll with the punch."&nbsp;</p><cite>Richard Casper </cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Targeting cancer cells with advanced medical imaging</h2>



<p>Radiation and chemotherapy are often used to try and slow progression of the cancer. The study is investigating an innovative approach researchers hope will help elderly glioblastoma patients live longer with fewer symptoms of the cancer and side effects from treatment.</p>



<p>It incorporates the use of an advanced medical imaging technique, called 18F-DOPA PET and MRI to target specific areas of the brain for treatment and spare healthy tissue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="557" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1024x557.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378592" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1024x557.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-300x163.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-768x418.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1536x836.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-2048x1114.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Dr. Vora showing how 18F-DOPA PET/MRI is being studied as a way to help improve treatment of glioblastoma</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"18F-DOPA is more or less a special type of sugar that cancer cells take at a faster rate compared to healthy cells that is very specific for glioblastoma. So, with this PET scan, we can actually now identify areas in the brain that are felt to be at highest risk for tumor growth," says Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>The other critical part of this regimen is that it's much more convenient for patients. "Instead of the traditional three to six weeks' worth of radiation, we're able to complete their entire treatment in one to two weeks, which allows more time for patients to stay with their family," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p>The areas are then targeted with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-proton-beam-therapy-bolsters-cancer-treatment/">proton beam therapy</a> to destroy cancer cells. Proton beam therapy is innovative technology that can painlessly deliver higher doses of radiation, in a shorter amount of time, with fewer side effects. </p>

<p>"I felt great," says Richard after completing his treatment. "I wouldn't even know I have a brain tumor right now if someone didn't tell me so." </p>



<p>Dr. Porter credits the study's treatment protocol. "With the shorter course of treatment, it saved him from many of the side effects that we know can be as devastating as the disease itself. He was able to finish the treatment, unscathed, walking and dancing into my office thrilled at how good he actually felt."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Richard survived almost twice longer than his original prognosis while maintaining his quality of life. "My dad defied the odds and kept going," says Susan, Richard's daughter. "To be almost 2 ½ years in after being told you only have a few months left to live, is quite remarkable."</p>

<p>The Casper family says they're proud of Richard's courage to help in the fight against cancer. "What he went through, and even during the trial, made a big difference in helping other people," says Carol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Richard maintained his valiant battle till the end. He died on March 8, 2023.&nbsp;"All of us at Mayo feel very fortunate to have known Mr. Casper," says Dr. Vora. "He was a very special person."</p>



<p>Dr. Vora presented results of the trial at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology. </p>



<p>"The results are quite promising," says Dr. Vora. "We're hoping to see these results carried on in a larger-scale study. If we continue to see the same types of results, we feel it could be a good option moving forward for all cancer patients."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Various strains of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV</a>, a viral infection, play a role in causing most cervical cancer. When people are exposed to genital HPV, their immune systems usually prevent the virus from doing serious harm. But sometimes the virus survives for years. Eventually, the&nbsp;virus can convert normal cells on the surface of the cervix into cancerous cells. Cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an&nbsp;HPV&nbsp;infection.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>I was recently diagnosed with cancer. Are there specific foods I should be eating or avoiding?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>It's not about any one food, and it's not about one diet; it's about a dietary pattern. The dietary pattern that organizations such as the American Institute for Cancer Research and the American Cancer Society recommend is a whole-food, plant-predominant diet. The whole food component is very important to emphasize — eating foods as close to nature as possible is key, not ones made in a factory. Aim to arrange half of your plate with a diverse array of colorful vegetables and fruits, a quarter from whole grains, and the rest from healthy sources of protein, especially from plant sources.</p>



<p>The average American consumes at least 63% ultraprocessed foods. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-are-ultraprocessed-foods-2/">Ultraprocessed foods</a> are factory-manufactured, packaged foods (frozen pizza, microwave meals, chips, pastries, cupcakes, muffins, processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages). These foods often have ingredients that are hard to pronounce. Studies show consumption of ultraprocessed food is linked directly to premature mortality or deaths from all causes. Cancer studies done in countries that don't consume nearly the amount of ultraprocessed foods compared to Americans show that not only do the ultraprocessed foods increase the risk of cancer occurring, but after a cancer diagnosis, these foods increase the risk of mortality. When you eat ultraprocessed foods, you're taking away the opportunity for your body to get nutrient-dense foods with vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients and fiber that can help fight cancer and keep it away. </p>



<p>Processed meat, which often includes hot dogs, deli food and sausage, is categorized as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization. To protect yourself against cancer, studies show that it would be best to avoid those foods. For your sources of protein, eat foods such as tofu, edamame, tempeh, fish, poultry and pulses.</p>



<p>What are pulses? Pulses are edible seeds from a legume plant. They include things such as lentils, peas and beans (black, pinto, kidney, chickpeas, etc.). Not only are you replacing animal protein when you consume pulses and soy, but you'll also get a lot of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiber</a>. And in the U.S., there's not a protein deficiency but a fiber deficiency. Soy foods are safe for all cancer patients and are an excellent source of plant protein. Studies show soy may improve survival after breast cancer.</p>



<p>Fiber is an essential nutrient, but only 5% of Americans get enough. A recent meta-analysis from the American Institute for Cancer Research Global Cancer Update Program showed that for every 10-gram increase in fiber in the diet, survival after breast cancer diagnosis improved by 13%. Health benefits of fiber include improved cholesterol, blood sugar regulation, gut health and digestion and weight control. Additionally, nuts and seeds have healthy, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fat/art-20045550#:~:text=Diets%20high%20in%20omega%2D3,heart%20and%20blood%20vessel%20diseases." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatty acids</a> that your body needs and are a great source of fiber and protein. But they are also calorie-dense, so be mindful of the serving size.</p>



<p>Aim to cut out ultraprocessed foods and consume mainly whole, plant-predominant foods:</p>



<ul>
<li>A wide variety of colorful vegetables and whole fruit (not fruit juice).</li>



<li>Whole grains, such as steal cut oats, quinoa, brown rice and barley, to name a few.</li>



<li>Proteins from nonanimal sources.</li>



<li>Foods that aren't made in a factory.</li>



<li>Drink water, not sugar-sweetened beverages.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can have a role in your cancer journey when you think of food as medicine, and that's exciting and empowering. — <strong style="font-size: revert;color: initial;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif"><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mussallem-dawn-m-d-o/bio-20055494?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Dr. Dawn Mussallem</a>, Integrative Medicine and Health, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

<p>Here's a look back at 10 (of many) of Mayo Clinic’s influential precision medicine research studies of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Mayo Clinic organoid study reveals possible key link to autism spectrum disorder</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft is-resized"><a href="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/cerebral-organoids2-002.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/cerebral-organoids2-002-1024x580.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13093" style="width:308px;height:auto" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Using miniaturized human brain models known as organoids, Mayo Clinic and Yale University scientists have discovered that the roots of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352928">autism spectrum disorder</a>&nbsp;may be associated with an imbalance of specific neurons that play a critical role in how the brain communicates and functions. The specific cells are known as excitatory cortical neurons. Led by &nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/abyzov-alexej-ph-d/bio-20089449">Alexej Abyzov, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;the new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01399-0">study</a>, published in Nature Neuroscience, reveals an abnormal imbalance of excitatory neurons in the forebrain of people with the disorder, with variations depending on their head size.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/08/10/mayo-clinic-mini-brain-study-reveals-possible-key-link-to-autism-spectrum-disorder/">Read more</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Mayo Clinic research uncovers epigenetic roots of digestive disorder associated with diabetes</strong></h3>

<p>In a new preclinical study, scientists at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/research/programs/precision-cancer-therapeutics">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a>&nbsp;have discovered insights into the root cause of diabetic gastroparesis. Published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508523048886">Gastroenterology</a>, the study, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ordog-tamas-m-d/bio-00095251">Tamas Ordog, M.D</a>., zeroed in on a gene-regulating protein in the gastrointestinal tract called hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A), which is known to help cells respond to low oxygen levels. The scientists found that HIF1A is also a key factor in regulating an enzyme called neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) within stomach nerve cells. As a result of this discovery, Dr. Ordog suggests that targeting H1F1A may be a useful therapeutic strategy.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/05/mayo-clinic-research-uncovers-epigenetic-roots-of-a-digestive-disorder-associated-with-diabetes/">Read more</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Mayo Clinic researchers link ovarian cancer to bacteria colonization in microbiome</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>A specific colonization of microbes in the reproductive tract is commonly found in women with ovarian cancer, according to a new study from Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine">Center for Individualized Medicine</a>. Published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27555-x">Scientific Reports</a>&nbsp;and led by<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/walther-antonio-marina-r-ph-d/bio-20087609">&nbsp;Marina Walther-Antonio, Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;and Abigail Asangba, Ph.D., the discovery strengthens evidence that the bacterial component of the microbiome — a community of microorganisms that also consists of viruses, yeasts and fungi — is an important indicator for early detection, diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian cancer. The study also suggests that a higher accumulation of pathogenic microbes plays a role in treatment outcomes and could be a potential indicator for predicting a patient's prognosis and response to therapy.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/01/16/mayo-clinic-researchers-link-ovarian-cancer-to-bacteria-colonization-in-microbiome/">Read more</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Could antidepressants cause treatment-emergent mania?</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright is-resized"><a href="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/antidepressants2.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/antidepressants2-1024x490.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13096" style="width:359px;height:auto" /></a></figure></div>


<p>In a new Mayo Clinic study, researchers have pinpointed a potential risk linked to antidepressants that boost mitochondrial energetics — a process responsible for extracting energy from nutrients to sustain cellular life. The findings suggest that such antidepressants may elevate the risk of treatment-emergent mania. The heightened energy expenditure during mania is linked to impulsivity, poor judgment, psychosis, and a loss of insight, often leading to high-risk behaviors that can result in hospitalization or incarceration. Published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01888-x">Molecular Psychiatry</a>, the study, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/frye-mark-a-m-d/bio-00077016">Mark Frye, M.D.</a>, specifically investigated the risk of treatment-emergent mania in people with bipolar disorder undergoing antidepressant treatment. The data suggest categorizing antidepressants based on mitochondrial energetics may be of value.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/01/24/could-antidepressants-cause-treatment-emergent-mania/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>The Tapestry study, an extensive and decentralized genomic sequencing clinical research study, aims to complete exome sequencing for 100,000 Mayo Clinic patients. The results will be integrated into the patients’ Electronic Health Record for three hereditary conditions, and the amassed data will contribute to a distinctive research dataset stored within the Mayo Clinic Cloud on the Omics Data Platform. The overall hope of Tapestry is to accelerate discoveries in individualized medicine to tailor prevention, diagnosis and treatment to a patient's unique genetic makeup. It is poised to advance evidence that exome sequencing, when applied to a diverse and comprehensive general population, can proficiently identify carriers of genetic variants that put them at higher risk for a disease so that they can take preventative measures.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/03/21/a-big-step-forward-bringing-dna-sequencing-data-to-routine-patient-care/">Read more</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Mayo Clinic discovery leads to diagnoses of 9 people with rare form of muscular dystrophy</strong></h3>

<p>Nine people around the world who have been living with unexplained, muscular dystrophy-like symptoms may now have an answer for what is causing the progressive muscle weakness in their body’s mid-section, arms and legs. In a new discovery, a collaborative team of scientists led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;has pinpointed alterations in a single gene deep inside these people's genetic blueprint as the root cause of their ultra-rare disorder, known as&nbsp;<a href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6907/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy">limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</a>. For some, the onset of debilitating muscle-wasting symptoms began in childhood, while others started having trouble walking, running, climbing stairs and breathing in adulthood. The new study describing their discovery is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929723001301">published</a>&nbsp;in the American Journal of Human Genetics.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/07/03/mayo-clinic-discovery-leads-to-diagnoses-of-9-people-with-rare-form-of-muscular-dystrophy/">Read more.</a></p>

<p>Scientists at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;have developed an artificial intelligence method, called Spatially Informed Artificial Intelligence (SPIN-AI). This new deep-learning technique can analyze the genetic information of individual cells to reconstruct the precise layout of the cells in a tissue, without preexisting knowledge of how the cells are organized.&nbsp; The scientists say their findings could potentially pave the way for individualized treatments that target the specific cellular traits of each person.

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/taneja-veena-ph-d/bio-00027247">Veena Taneja, Ph.D.</a>, have discovered a link between an abundance of specific gut bacteria and the triggering of an immune response against a person's tissue. The new study, published in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37656793/">Science Advances</a>, reveals an immune response occurs even before the clinical symptoms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648">rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;appear. Using a preclinical model, the researchers determined that the gut bacteria Eggerthella lenta causes an autoimmune response before the onset of the clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. In that response, the immune system produces autoantibodies that mistakenly target and attack the body's tissues and cells instead of foreign invaders, such as bacteria or viruses.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/18/mayo-clinic-researchers-identify-link-between-gut-bacteria-and-pre-clinical-autoimmunity-and-aging-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have identified a key gene, CDCP1, linked to improvement in heart function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a common cause of heart failure. The study, the first genome-wide association of its kind, reveals that a genetic variation in CDCP1 influences susceptibility to the condition and response to therapies. The gene's connection to cardiac fibrosis and the biomarker known as sST2 opens avenues for potential drug therapies targeting CDCP1 to mitigate adverse effects of heart failure. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37800334/">study</a>, led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pereira-naveen-l-m-d/bio-20178506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</a> is published in Circulation Research. <a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/11/27/mayo-clinic-study-explores-heart-failure-uncovers-genes-role-in-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.  </p>

<p>Lorie Kirkman embraces a lifestyle of being on the move. The 38-year-old is a wife and mom to three young daughters who are active in their Northeast Florida community and have a passion for being outdoors.</p>



<p>After working out at her gym one day, Lorie began to feel pain in her back and shoulder. When it became uncomfortable to sit or lay down, and she noticed exhaustion and difficulty sleeping, Lorie went to her local physician for answers.</p>

<p>"My first thought when they told me that I had cancer was: I have three little girls," says Lorie. "I can't have cancer. I have three little girls."</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20352489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor</a> had destroyed multiple areas of bone, including 25% of her T5 vertebrae and nearly 80% at T8. The result was a pathologic fracture with angulation of the spine, which put her at risk of a spinal cord injury and potential paralysis.</p>



<p>Lorie’s care was transferred to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, where a multidisciplinary team could coordinate her care.</p>



<p>"Once I reviewed her imaging, I had a discussion with Lorie and explained the precarious situation that she was in," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/buchanan-ian-a-m-d/bio-20521017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ian Buchanan</a>, a Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon. "We discussed with radiation and medical oncology teams, and we all agreed that we needed to proceed with surgery as the first step, with the explicit understanding being that she would need additional therapies, including radiation and chemotherapy."</p>



<p>Lorie's care team, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/starr-jason-s-d-o/bio-20439448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jason Starr</a>, a medical oncologist, began implementing the subsequent phases of treatment with insights from her surgery.</p>



<p>"Having the expertise and ability for one physician to pick up the phone, speak to an expert, and get real-time recommendations is unique to Mayo Clinic," says Dr. Starr.</p>

<p>"As physicians, we all go into this profession because we want to help people. An important part of helping patients is getting them back to a good quality of life," says Dr. Buchanan. "When you plan a surgery and interact with a patient, the goals of care have to align with what quality of life means for them."</p>



<p>For Lorie, quality of life means being there for her daughters — bringing them to school events and playing outdoors.</p>



<p>"I want my daughters to see me as their mom," says Lorie. "That was one of my promises to them: I'm still your mom, you're not losing me. I'm still here, I'll be OK. There are things that I have to do. There are doctor's appointments I have to go to. There are medicines that I'm going to have to take and therapies that I'm going to endure."</p>



<p>Lorie returned to the gym — building her strength — got back to playing with her daughters in the yard, and, over the summer, took her family on a kayaking adventure.</p>

<p>"Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of these research efforts so that we have better treatment options and patients can live better, longer, fulfilling lives," says Dr. Starr. "Lorie is doing all the heavy lifting, and we're cheering her on."</p>



<p>She is focused on her family and taking each day as it comes.</p>



<p>"For somebody with currently incurable cancer, it's nice to know that Mayo Clinic is working toward finding other treatments or a cure — that'd be nice," says Lorie. "Because every little girl needs her mama forever."</p>
