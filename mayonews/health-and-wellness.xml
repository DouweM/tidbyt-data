<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>A Rochester resident's triumph over tennis elbow through percutaneous hydrotenotomy&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>A couple of years ago, Sara Stenhaug began experiencing debilitating right elbow pain, commonly known as tennis elbow. Physical therapy and dry needling failed to provide the desired relief, leaving Sara frustrated and challenged by the persistent symptoms. She found it difficult to continue with daily activities like exercise, crafting and cooking. Even simple tasks like opening the window blinds were painful. Each day brought pain and frustration. Driven by the desire to regain functionality and return to a beloved pastime — pickleball, Sara reached out to Mayo Clinic for a solution.</p>



<p>Seeking a solution to her pain and wanting to return to her favorite sport, Sara was referred to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/konidis-jane-m-d/bio-20508998">Dr. Jane Konidis, </a>a physician in Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/physical-medicine-rehabilitation-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20467039">Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, </a>who suggested a percutaneous hydrotenotomy, also known as TenJet. The procedure, performed on July 13, proved to be less invasive than traditional methods, did not require anesthesia and provided an almost miraculously immediate relief from her pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The hardest thing about the recovery wasn't that I was in pain. I had no pain,” says Sara. "The mental aspect of recovery was a lot harder than the physical for me because I had no pain.&nbsp;I knew I had to gradually build up strength over time for long-term healing. It was difficult for me to set strict boundaries around my recovery plan because I just wanted to get back to playing pickleball."</p>



<p>Working with Dr. Konidis and Mark Jensen, her physical therapist, Sara developed a post-procedure exercise plan, changing pickleball to biking, and high-intensity workouts to hiking and walking. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of financial considerations, Sara noted that while platelet-rich plasma and shockwave procedures also were recommended, they required out-of-pocket expenses. The TenJet procedure, on the other hand, was covered by insurance, making it a more accessible option for her and other patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sara, a retired teacher and active member of the community in Rochester, Minnesota, expresses gratitude for the support she received. "Dr. Konidis is very intelligent, obviously knows what she's talking about and can easily spell it all out. I think I was in and out in 40 minutes. It was all just great," she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now six months since her procedure, Sara has returned to the pickleball court. While the pace of play is a little less intense, Sara is extremely grateful to resume a pain-free, active lifestyle. As she continues her journey toward building up strength, she enthusiastically advocates for the TenJet procedure, urging others confronting similar challenges to consider this innovative approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Knowing what I know now, would I do it again? Absolutely," she says. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What does it take to make meaningful, lasting lifestyle changes? Some may argue it takes a fair amount of willpower to develop new habits, but a person can't rely on willpower alone. </p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hensrud-donald-d-m-d-m-s/bio-20053543?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Donald Hensrud</a>, a Mayo Clinic physician specializing in nutrition and editor of "<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/product/the-mayo-clinic-diet-third-edition/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mayo Clinic Diet</a>," offers strategies that can help people achieve their weight-loss goals.</p>

<p>What is willpower? Merriam-Webster defines it as the ability to control one's own actions, emotions or urges.</p>



<p>When it comes to pushing away the potato chips and picking up the walking pace, it's easier said than done. Dr. Donald Hensrud often hears from patients that they don't have the willpower to undertake weight management.</p>



<p>"I think everybody has willpower. It's not a matter of willpower, there are powerful forces causing us to eat more and to do less activity," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>It's a matter of coming up with strategies to deal with the challenges.</p>



<p>"... and these strategies need to be practical, realistic and enjoyable enough to be sustainable. We can't just not eat. We have to eat. Nobody has perfect habits," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>He says coming up with strategies to eat healthy, low-calorie, nutrient-dense foods can be a way to game the system, and not just rely on willpower.</p>



<p>"That usually doesn't work in the long term," he says. "It's a matter of changing habits and coming up with new lifestyle changes that will fit the bill and help us manage our weight as we move along."</p>



<p>Dr. Hensrud says it's important to be kind to yourself too, and to ask yourself if you are ready for the challenge.</p>

<p>EAU CLAIRE, Wis. — Sleep might not be at the top of the list when you think about ways to boost your athletic performance. But it's just as important as your training program, nutrition and hydration.</p>



<p><strong>Why does sleep play such a crucial role not only for performance but also for overall health?</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="280" height="280" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/amy-rantala-md.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379845" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/amy-rantala-md.jpg 280w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/amy-rantala-md-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Amy Rantala</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"When you sleep, your brain processes all the information you've taken in during the day," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/amy-rantala-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Rantala, M.D.</a>, a sports medicine physician at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire</a>. "Sleep filters out and deletes some information, while storing other information in memory. That includes assimilating new skills or techniques you may have learned that day so they become an intuitive part of your sports performance."</p>



<p>As you push your body to be stronger, go faster and be more agile, your tissues undergo continual wear and tear. Sleep provides your body time and energy to repair the wear and tear. Because your body has undergone these repair sessions, you're less likely to be injured. You're also less likely to become ill because sleep strengthens your immune system.</p>



<p>Studies of collegiate athletes show that when they don't get enough sleep, their reaction times and accuracy decrease. One study focusing on basketball free throws and three-pointers found that sleep-deprived athletes can see a drop of 50% in accuracy. With 10 or more hours of sleep, accuracy can increase by 10%. That's a 60% potential difference in performance.</p>



<p>Getting enough sleep also helps with your mental health and resiliency. The&nbsp;National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)&nbsp;has added sleep screening to its best practices to monitor for conditions like insomnia and sleep apnea.</p>



<p><strong>How much sleep is enough?&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>So, what is adequate sleep? It depends on your age and stage of life:</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Children</strong><br>Kids 6–12 should get nine to 12 hours of sleep.</li>



<li><strong>Teens</strong><br>Young people ages 13–18 should get eight to 10 hours of sleep.</li>



<li><strong>Adults</strong><br>Those older than 18 need seven or more hours of sleep.</li>
</ul>



<p>Teenage student athletes face numerous challenges to achieve that sweet spot of eight to 10 hours of sleep, including the demands of training, the times when games and practices are held, school, work, and social and family time.</p>



<p>"During the teen years, the body undergoes a change in the natural sleep-wake cycle, known as circadian rhythm," Dr. Rantala says. "Teens tend to stay up later at night and sleep later in the morning. That's why those early morning practices can play havoc with a teen's sleep reservoir and influence a student athlete's mental and physical health."</p>



<p><strong>Tips for getting a good night's sleep</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Just like a training routine sets you up for athletic success, a bedtime routine sets you up for sleep success.</p>



<p><strong>An effective sleep routine includes:</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Avoiding vigorous exercise, training or competitions one to two hours before bedtime.</li>



<li>Holding off on large meals, alcohol and caffeine too late in the evening.</li>



<li>Creating a sleep-friendly environment. Your bedroom should be quiet, dark, relaxing and cool. Your mind and body should understand, "This is where I sleep."</li>



<li>Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.</li>



<li>Setting aside at least 20 to 30 minutes before bedtime to wind down. That includes turning off all electronics and screens, such as phones, tablets and TVs. Instead, dim the lights, set out your clothes for the next day, write in your journal or do other quiet activities.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>What if I still have trouble sleeping?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Daily life is full of stressors that can sabotage your best attempts to establish a healthy sleep routine. One of those stressors may be a wearable device tracking your sleep. If you're sleep deprived, seeing regular reminders of your lack of sleep can be stressful.</p>



<p>"Having a good support network of family, friends, coaches and teammates to talk with can help you cope with stress," Dr. Rantala says. "If sleep still is elusive, consider counseling, which may include cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, meditation and journaling."</p>



<p>Just like learning and gaining proficiency in your sport takes practice, so does getting a good night's sleep. The sleep habits you develop and practice now will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>Starting a workout program or being physically active takes motivation and commitment. The key is to start slowly and do something you take pleasure in.</p>



<p>"If you hate swimming, don't try to start to become a swimmer. But (if) you enjoy dancing or other activities (such as) gardening, those are forms of activity that once you engage in, you increase your consistency and compliance that will have the most health benefits," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>

<p>Being active can build muscle strength and improve cognitive and cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>"Three percent or 30 minutes a day of our waking hours, if we commit that to physical activity, will have huge benefits," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>And for those young at heart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.</p>



<p>"As we get older, dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips to get started and stick with a workout plan:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Research workout routines.</li>



<li>Schedule your workouts.</li>



<li>Find an exercise buddy.</li>



<li>Be consistent.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's officially 2024. A new year offers new beginnings and an opportunity to reset your eating habits after the holidays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is your refrigerator holding onto holiday leftovers? It's OK to let them go.</p>



<p>"What we want to do is, if we have any remaining food items or beverages that lingered after the holidays, we want to get rid of them," she says.</p>

<p>Either throw leftovers away or slowly eat them in smaller <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1">por</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tions</a>.</p>



<p>"We also want to slowly regress back to our old habits. Start introducing vegetables and fruits with most meals," says Delgado.</p>



<p>And pay attention to your food portion sizes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We don't necessarily have to go on a diet. We don't necessarily have to eliminate all of our foods. We just want to look at the portion sizes and the frequency that we have these foods," she says.</p>



<p>Opt for lean protein, whole grains and fresh produce in your diet, still allowing for an occasional treat.</p>



<p>"With nutrition, there is no all or nothing. We can still enjoy those nice treats, those good desserts, those savory beverages. It's all in how much and how often we are having them," says Delgado.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reset your eating habits with portion control</h3>



<p>Simplify your portion control by dividing your plate into three sections. This can assist you in making healthier food choices and managing your portions more effectively.</p>



<ul>
<li>One-half: fruit and nonstarchy vegetables</li>



<li>One-quarter: whole grains</li>



<li>One-quarter: protein-rich foods, such as legumes, fish or lean meats</li>
</ul>

<p>"It's worthwhile having that conversation with your primary care team because we might change depending on conditions that you have and potentially even the age at which you would receive that vaccine," says Dr. Presutti.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adult vaccinations to update</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pneumonia</a> can be life-threatening when fluid fills the lungs' air sacs. In general, a vaccination is recommended for all adults 65 and older.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shingles/symptoms-causes/syc-20353054?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shingles</a>, a reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox, can cause a painful, blistering rash. Vaccination is recommended in adults over 50.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetanus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351625?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tetanus</a> is caused by a bacterial infection, often from a cut or wound. The Tdap vaccine is recommended every 10 years and also protects against diphtheria and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/whooping-cough-pertussis-is-a-highly-contagious-respiratory-tract-infection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pertussis</a> – the latter known as whooping cough.</p>



<p>"If you're a new parent or a new grandparent, then you should be getting the pertussis update vaccine to decrease the risk of you actually communicating, or giving, pertussis to the newborn baby," says Dr. Presutti.</p>

<p>Most people have done it at least once. They make a New Year's resolution to get in better shape, but give up after a few days or weeks.</p>



<p>Johnson says there are a few things you can do to increase your odds of making good on that resolution.</p>



<p>"Making sure that you start with a really realistic goal," Johnson says, is the first step, "then really thinking about what do you enjoy."</p>



<p>Johnson says one of the first hurdles that trips a lot of people up is forcing themselves to do exercises they hate.</p>



<p>"[Start] looking at some new goals that you can be excited about," she says. "Exercise should not be drudgery. Exercise should be fun."</p>



<p>Johnson says it's also important to be realistic about your time commitment.</p>



<p>"Maybe you only have 20, 30 minutes three days a week," she says. "Start from a place where we can build success. You can always add more."</p>



<p>But above all else, she says, be honest with yourself about what you can stick to. If it's not a feasible goal, your chances of achieving it drop drastically.</p>



<p>"So having realistic, healthy expectations can be a really good way to move forward in a very successful physical activity plan."</p>

<p>During the holiday season, it may seem like opportunities to celebrate are everywhere, and alcohol is often part of the festivities. When it comes to alcohol, though, the key is moderation. Besides the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/alcohol/art-20044551?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-term risks of alcohol use</a>, an immediate consequence is often a hangover.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>What is a hangover?</strong></p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hangovers/symptoms-causes/syc-20373012?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hangover</a>&nbsp;is a group of unpleasant signs and symptoms that can develop after drinking too much alcohol. Generally, the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to have a hangover the next day. But no magic formula can tell you how much you can drink and still avoid a hangover.</p>



<p>Hangover signs and symptoms typically begin when your blood alcohol content drops significantly and is at or near zero. They're usually in full effect the morning after a night of heavy drinking and can include fatigue, excessive thirst, dry mouth, headache and nausea.</p>



<p>However unpleasant, most hangovers go away on their own. In the meantime, you can ease the discomfort by taking these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hangovers/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373015?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">measures</a>.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>When is a hangover an emergency?</strong></p>



<p>Severe signs and symptoms that accompany heavy drinking may indicate alcohol poisoning, which is a life-threatening emergency.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms that may indicate alcohol poisoning include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Confusion</li>



<li>Vomiting</li>



<li>Seizures</li>



<li>Slow breathing (less than eight breaths per minute)</li>



<li>Irregular breathing (a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths)</li>



<li>Blue-tinged or pale skin</li>



<li>Low body temperature</li>



<li>Difficulty remaining conscious</li>



<li>Passing out and can't be awakened</li>
</ul>



<p>If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning — even if you don't see the classic signs and symptoms — call 911 or your local emergency number.</p>

This disorder also involves having to drink more to get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking called alcoholism.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I worry about my neighbors this time of year who live alone. Are there health risks to loneliness? What can be done to help?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Up to 40% of older adults feel lonely. Loneliness can occur in all age groups, but people over the age of 60 have been shown to have higher incidences of both loneliness and social isolation. Loneliness is a feeling, while social isolation is something that can be measured. For example, how often do you talk to someone? How often do you leave the house? Do you attend religious services or other community events? Some people can be surrounded by a crowd but still feel lonely because they're not experiencing good connections. Social isolation measures how often you interact with other people and genuinely connect.</p>



<p>Health risks associated with loneliness can include depression, anxiety, increased risks of suicide, premature death, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dementia</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strokes</a>, heart attacks and other chronic health risks. The health risks of a lack of social connection can be just as high as the health risks of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>, smoking, physical inactivity or excessive alcohol consumption. If we pay attention to those other areas of our health, we should pay attention to social connectedness. High blood pressure, stroke and heart attack risk increase as we age. If you combine that risk with someone who is also lonely, that can increase the health risk.  </p>



<p>If someone falls who is socially isolated, the risk of complications from a potential hip fracture increases because no one may be checking in on them. If patients are admitted to the hospital for a heart attack and score high on loneliness, they are more likely to get readmitted to the hospital. If you need a colonoscopy but don't have someone to drive you, you might not get your needed procedure done. Health systems recognize these healthcare impacts and now routinely ask patients about their social connections. The U.K. and Japanese governments have recognized the public health impacts and have established ministerial leads addressing loneliness, including a "Campaign to End Loneliness" in the U.K.</p>



<p>There are many things that you can do to address loneliness and social isolation. One of the best is addressing sensory deprivation, specifically hearing and vision. When someone has hearing loss, it becomes challenging (even with hearing aids) to go to a party or a crowded restaurant. The person withdraws because they can't understand what's happening around them. Things that can help this are getting your hearing checked, ensuring you have a suitable hearing aid and learning how to use it properly. These little "computers for your ears" can make interacting with people in a social setting easier.</p>



<p>Taking the first steps may be intimidating, but someone else's assistance could help get you there. Social workers can be a great resource for connecting people to social resources. People may find support from a faith community or hobby groups. You find like-minded people when you do things you are passionate about or interested in. Many people benefit from intergenerational activities such as volunteering in schools and reading to children at the library. Social media and online resources can be another way to discover these opportunities.</p>



<p>While social media is a tool that can be used to connect to people of similar interests, there is still a need for direct human interaction. Physical touch, such as a handshake or a hug, is vital from infancy onward. The holidays can be an intensified time for people to be aware of their loneliness. Maybe you saw someone throwing a holiday party, but you were home alone. Loneliness may spike during the holidays because of what is seen in the media, through our own expectations or loss of family connection.</p>



<p>When we feel lonely, we may feel like people should come to us and fill our cups, but sometimes it's up to us to put ourselves out there. Even if you take a moment to make a small interaction at the grocery store, it may make your world seem a little less lonely. If we can start giving some energy to the universe, the universe will give it back to us and help us all feel more connected to each other. <em>— <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shah-amit-a-m-d/bio-20113894?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Amit Shah</a></strong></em><strong><em>, Geriatrician, Internist, Palliative Care Specialist, Mayo Clinic in Arizona</em></strong></p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. – The holidays have come and gone once again, and many of us are starting to think about just how much we indulged this season.</p>



<p>"When it came to eating, how did this past holiday season treat you? Which healthy habits did you maintain and which ones did you neglect?" asks <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/-/media/shared-files/images/medical-professionals/full/mankato/lisa-hardesty-phdlp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Hardesty,</a> Ph.D., a clinical health psychologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato</a>. "It is easy to feel like a failure in relationship to maintaining our healthy focus, but consistency and allowing yourself grace are important concepts to remember over the holiday time."</p>



<p>Shame, guilt and disappointment are several feelings that can lead people to kick-start strict diets beginning Jan. 1. But drastic overnight changes to habits are rarely sustainable. That's why Hardesty recommends mindful eating throughout the year.</p>



<p>"With so much of our family and social time structured around food and the act of eating during the holidays, it's no wonder that we feel like we need a reset to our eating habits this time of year when the celebrations are over," says Hardesty. "But there are healthier, more sustainable ways to approach eating habits."</p>



<p>Here are Hardesty's recommendations to lessen your responsiveness to food triggers.</p>



<p><strong>Identify your "why."</strong> Adopting a healthy eating mindset starts with identifying the reasons you want to eat healthier. What compelling reasons come up when you consider this question?</p>



<p><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> Having a plan is one of the most important things you can do. Anticipate when you may have more difficulty making healthy choices and create a solid plan for those times.</p>



<p><strong>Slow down.</strong> Instead of moving from dish to dish, first survey the options in front of you and decide which ones you want and how much you want before adding food to your plate. Then, when you sit down to eat, savor your food and focus mindfully to help you make better choices compared to eating without conscious thought.</p>



<p><strong>Allow for indulgences.</strong> It's also important to allow yourself a few unhealthy food options but decide when and where you will make those choices. When you eat those lower quality foods, be aware of your negative emotions and don’t allow shame to perpetuate overindulgences.</p>



<p><strong>Additional techniques to help modify your eating behavior include:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Bringing fruit and vegetables to holiday gatherings to create more options for yourself and others.</li>



<li>Eating a light snack before attending holiday events to lessen the likelihood of overeating.</li>



<li>Measuring and portioning your food over the holidays.</li>



<li>Increasing your level of activity and exercise.</li>



<li>Committing to making changes with someone close to you.</li>



<li>Banking your calories if you know you'll attend an event with more food options available.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Don't despair if you temporarily lose control of your food choices," says Hardesty. "Remember, consistency is key – not perfection."</p>
