<p>Every eight minutes, a person is added to the national kidney transplant waiting list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Unfortunately, in this country, there is a large gap between the demand for kidney transplantation and the supply of organs from deceased donors," says Dr. Issa.Dialysis is an option for patients with end-stage kidney disease. Though Dr. Issa says a transplant is preferred — and having a living donor is best.</p>

<p>"Kidney transplantation offers greater survival benefits and increases the lifespan of people in need of kidney transplant," he says.</p>



<p>And that's a reason why it's important to expand the eligible kidney donor pool.</p>



<p>"Allowing people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus may open the door for some people who have not been eligible before to be potential living kidney donors," Dr. Issa says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Criteria for a living kidney donor with Type 2 diabetes </h3>



<p>Those eligible must be older than 60, have well-controlled Type 2 diabetes, not on insulin and have no family history of kidney disease.</p>



<p>"Any potential individual who would like to be a candidate for living kidney donation should undergo a very thorough health assessment and very thorough examination to ensure they are healthy enough," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>It's about safeguarding the potential donor's overall health — while helping close the gap.</p>

<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/davis-dawn-marie-r-m-d/bio-20054974?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Dawn Davis</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric dermatologist, weighs in on what tweens should and should not be using as part of their skincare routines.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:09) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/SCRIPT-MCM-Tween-skincare.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Sharing the steps to achieve younger-looking skin is a popular trend seen on social media. It has young girls, in particular, seeking out pricey skincare products with anti-aging properties.</p>



<p>"Oftentimes, these young children will be given complex skincare regimens that are even more complicated than adults will use on their own skin," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>She says a lot of anti-aging products have acids and chemicals in them that can be potentially irritating to gentle or young skin.</p>



<p>"The more often that you expose yourself to a particular chemical, the more likely you are, as you age, to develop an irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from those chemicals," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>She says when it comes to skin in general, less is more.</p>



<p>"The best things that all children can do for their skin mirrors that of adults."</p>



<p>Here's what she recommends for tweens ages 8 through 12:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wash face with water and a gentle cleanser twice a day.</li>



<li>Apply a hypoallergenic, unfragranced or unscented moisturizer to skin.</li>



<li>Apply a sunscreen that contains a physical blocker, such as zinc oxide.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Once you reach pubertal stage or prepuberty, it is helpful to look for moisturizers that are specific to the face and neck if you're looking for cosmetic improvement," adds Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>Sunscreen is recommended for everyone 6 months and older. She also recommends sunscreens of at least SPF 15 when indoors and at least SPF 30 when outdoors.</p>



<p>Something else everyone can do to help keep their skin healthy is to avoid smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.</p>

<p><em>Multiple doctors and multiple examinations could not figure out why Lauri Sieben had spent much of her life “never feeling quite right” physically. Fortunately for Lauri, that changed after her daughter Christy began working as a genetic counselor in Mayo Clinic’s Molecular Technologies Laboratory. After seeing similarities between the patient testing she was performing for the lab and the physical symptoms being experienced by her mom, Christy took a leading role in getting Lauri to undergo molecular and biochemical testing at Mayo Clinic. The results of that testing not only provided much-needed answers, but a promising path forward for Lauri.</em></p>



<p>Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder that prevents the body from producing enough healthy alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-GAL) enzymes. Without functioning alpha-GAL enzymes, harmful levels of fat-like substances called sphingolipids build up in the blood vessels. Over time, this buildup can result in life-threatening damage to the heart, kidneys, brain, and central nervous system.</p>



<p>There are two recognized forms of Fabry disease: classic and late-onset/atypical. Symptoms of classic Fabry disease typically manifest during childhood and progressively worsen over time. People diagnosed with late-onset Fabry disease typically do not experience symptoms until their 30s or older. The first indication of trouble may be kidney failure or heart disease.</p>



<p>For Lauri Sieben, it was “horrendous tummy problems” that began in childhood and carried through into adulthood. “My mother told me she would take me to the doctor constantly while I was young because they couldn't figure out why I felt horrible all the time,” Lauri says.</p>



<p>Now in her late 60s and newly retired from her career as a scheduler for Mayo Clinic, Lauri had pushed through the mental and physical fog of “never feeling quite right” for decades before her symptoms took a turn for the worse. “Probably about 10 years ago is when the ringing in the ears, the dizziness, and the burning sensation in my hands began,” she says. “None of the doctors I went to could figure out what was going on.”</p>



<p>Nor could the electrocardiograms Lauri would have done in response to the shortness of breath and chest pain she was also experiencing. “The results would come back abnormal, but they didn’t point to a specific cause, so I was repeatedly sent back home without a diagnosis or treatment plan,” she says.</p>



<p>All of that began to change after Lauri’s daughter, Christy Koellner, began working as a genetic counselor in Mayo Clinic’s Molecular Technologies (formerly Molecular Genetics) Laboratory. “When I started, the very first thing I was doing was assessing new patient cases that came into the lab and making sure we had enough information to run the tests,” Christy says. “One of the testing rotations we had was molecular testing for biochemical disorders, and one of them was Fabry.”</p>



<p>As she settled into her new role with the Molecular Technologies Lab, it didn’t take Christy long to make a correlation between the patient testing she was performing, and the physical symptoms being experienced by her mom.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“I WAS STARTING TO SEE PATIENTS COMING IN WITH RINGING IN THE EARS, DIZZINESS, AND TIAS (TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS), AND I IMMEDIATELY STARTED THINKING ABOUT MY MOM,” SHE SAYS. “SHE WAS EXPERIENCING THE SAME THINGS.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At first, Christy thought it was just the result of her being a new genetic counselor not long out of graduate school. “In one of the medical school classes I had to take, they talked about ‘med school student syndrome,’ where it’s like everything you hear about, you see in somebody,” she says. “So initially, I thought, ‘I don’t know. I might just be thinking it’s Fabry disease because I’m directly working with it right now.’”</p>



<p>But then, after multiple conversations with physician colleagues Ande Rumilla, M.D., and Linda Hasadsri, M.D., Ph.D., about her mom’s search for a diagnosis amid her worsening health, Christy’s suspicions and resolve to get her mom tested for Fabry disease solidified.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“DURING THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION, I LISTED OUT EVERYTHING MY MOM WAS EXPERIENCING — THE RINGING IN THE EARS, THE PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, THE CHEST PAINS, THE DECREASE IN SWEATING, THE CORNEAL PROBLEMS, AND IT ALL JUST STARTED TO CLICK,” CHRISTY SAYS. “IT WAS LIKE ‘CHECK, CHECK, CHECK,’ FOR FABRY DISEASE. AFTER THAT CONVERSATION, I KNEW WE HAD TO GET HER TESTED.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Testing brings answers, and treatment</strong></h2>



<p>At Christy’s urging, Lauri underwent molecular and biochemical genetic testing at Mayo Clinic a short time later. The results would give Lauri a mix of emotions. “It came back positive for Fabry,” she says. “It was honestly a bit of a shocker, but it was also vindication that all these things that have been happening to me all these years were happening. I wasn’t imagining them. After processing it for a bit, I was actually excited to find out what was wrong with me, and I was just hoping there was a treatment for it.”</p>



<p>With a diagnosis now in hand, the next step&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;getting Lauri the treatment she needed to manage her symptoms. That journey began just a couple of days later when she met with Eva Morava-Kozicz, M.D., Ph.D., a clinical genomics physician at Mayo Clinic who would become a key member of Lauri’s care team. “She saw me right away and was absolutely amazing,” Lauri says. “She jumped on top of everything and got everything going.”</p>



<p>That “everything” began with enzyme replacement therapy infusions at Mayo Clinic, a first line of defense against Fabry disease intended to give Lauri’s body the missing enzyme it needs to function properly. “It’s helping her body break down all the stored material and is preventing her from getting fatal kidney and heart disease and is also helping with the pain by preventing peripheral nerve damage,” Dr. Morava-Kozicz says. “Depression can be another symptom of Fabry disease, and this therapy can also help prevent that and other central nervous system symptoms.”</p>



<p>For Lauri, her body’s response to the enzyme infusions has been encouraging. “I’m definitely feeling better than I was before my diagnosis,” she says. “Everything’s not perfect, but a lot of the pain in my hands has gone away. I can tell when it’s time for another infusion because my hands and toes will start tingling again.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“IN THE PAST, WHEN WE DIDN’T KNOW THAT FABRY DISEASE IS A GENETIC CONDITION, AND WE DIDN’T KNOW IT COULD BE TREATED, WE JUST TREATED THE SYMPTOMS — THE HYPERTENSION, THE KIDNEY FAILURE, THE HEART DISEASE,” DR. MORAVA-KOZICZ SAYS. “BUT THESE PATIENTS DIED VERY EARLY, AND NOW THAT WE HAVE ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY FOR FABRY DISEASE, WE CAN PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That prevention, of course, cannot begin without accurate diagnostic testing to confirm the presence of Fabry disease, a process for which Mayo Clinic offers multiple approaches. “The bulk of our Fabry disease testing is done in our Biochemical Genetics Laboratory,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hasadsri-linda-m-d-ph-d/bio-20514421">Linda Hasadsri, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a consultant in Mayo Clinic’s Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics who was part of the team that analyzed Lauri’s test results and confirmed her diagnosis. “Mayo offers everything from newborn screening for Fabry through dried blood spots to diagnostic testing done through our molecular lab to biomarker testing that helps us monitor the progression of the disease in affected individuals as well as their response to treatment.”</p>



<p>While other medical laboratories offer similar testing options for Fabry disease, Amy White, a genetic counselor in Mayo Clinic’s Biochemical Genetics Laboratory, says what sets Mayo Clinic apart is the biomarker testing that’s also used to add an additional layer of accuracy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“WE OFFER BOTH URINE CERAMIDE TRIHEXIDES AND BLOOD LYSO, AND THOSE IN COMBINATION OR INDIVIDUALLY ARE AN EXTRA DATA POINT THAT CAN HELP US DETERMINE IF A PATIENT IS TRULY AFFECTED BY FABRY DISEASE,” WHITE SAYS. “SOMETIMES THERE ARE DNA CHANGES THAT ARE FOUND, AND WE DON’T KNOW IF THEY CAUSE DISEASE OR NOT. OUR BIOMARKER TESTING IS A FUNCTIONAL TEST AND ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THAT CAN TELL US WHETHER A PERSON IS TRULY AFFECTED BY FABRY DISEASE.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Not just a man’s disease</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to timely and accurate laboratory testing, an equally important component to Lauri getting the diagnosis and treatment plan she needed to manage her symptoms was breaking through the misconception that Fabry disease is a genetic disorder that only affects men. “When Christy and I first began suspecting and asking about Fabry disease, we had at least one clinician say, ‘No, that’s a man’s disease,’” Lauri says. “It was dismissed right away.”</p>



<p>Since Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder, White says it is true that Fabry is typically diagnosed in males more than females, but as Lauri’s case shows, it can still very much affect females.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“IT’S A MISNOMER THAT FEMALES ARE JUST CARRIERS OF FABRY DISEASE,” WHITE SAYS. “THE MAJORITY OF FEMALES WHO HAVE A DNA CHANGE IN THE GENE FOR FABRY DISEASE DO HAVE SYMPTOMS, BUT THOSE SYMPTOMS MAY PRESENT LATER IN LIFE, AND THEY MAY PRESENT DIFFERENTLY THAN THEY DO IN MALES.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The challenge for physicians is then determining both when and how to test a patient suspected of having Fabry. “Clinicians who care for pediatric patients and have a male patient with unexplained burning pain in their hands and feet should definitely consider testing for Fabry disease given that we know that is a hallmark early sign of Fabry,” White says. “I’ve also encountered females who have had the burning hand and foot pain as early as age 8 to 10, but it’s much more common in males at that age. Females with cardiomyopathy are the next group of patients where we should think about Fabry disease in the differential diagnosis. And then, of course, any males or females with kidney disease moving toward kidney failure should also be assessed for Fabry. And finally, ophthalmologists may see corneal whirling in males or females with Fabry disease, and that could be the initial symptom that’s present and detected for this condition.”</p>

<p>Once Fabry is suspected, it’s important to understand which test to order to accurately confirm or rule out that suspicion. “For males, you can order enzyme or DNA testing, but with females, it’s really best to order DNA testing first because you can get false positives and false negatives with enzyme testing for females,” White says.</p>



<p>To which Dr. Hasadsri adds: “Fabry testing for females is tricky. There is a danger with female patients of only doing biochemical testing in that if that’s negative, you’re actually not done testing. You still need to do molecular testing to make an accurate diagnosis. Doing molecular-only testing can also be equivocal, so doing additional biochemical testing can help resolve variants of uncertain significance.”</p>



<p>For Christy, the benefits of having all of those testing options available in one place for her mom have been immeasurable. “My mom has always been a very light and airy person — very Zen-like. And after her diagnosis and treatment began, there was a veil lifted from her that I didn’t even know was there,” Christy says. “There’s more of a sense of peace that comes off of her now. It’s just so wonderful that we were able to get the testing she needed, and that it was all available right here at Mayo Clinic.”</p>

To better understand the condition, the Mayo Clinic News Network reached out to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/botha-hugo-m-b-ch-b/bio-20518791?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Hugo Botha</a>, a neurologist at Mayo Clinic, to explain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is aphasia?</strong></h2>



<p>Aphasia is a broad term that refers to a problem with language. So, for example, patients with aphasia may have trouble understanding what other people are saying, understanding what they read, or may have trouble putting their thoughts into words. It is not a&nbsp;disease&nbsp;in the sense that something like diabetes is a disease. There are many different diseases that can cause aphasia – for example, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a> or head injuries, or progressive brain diseases, like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer’s disease.</a></p>



<p>When aphasia is the main symptom of a progressive brain disease it is called primary progressive aphasia.</p>



<p>Because aphasia can result from many different diseases, the specific symptoms, treatment and prognosis varies greatly depending on the underlying cause and severity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What causes aphasia?</strong></h2>



<p>Aphasia most commonly results from damage to the language centers in the brain, which are primarily found in the left half of the brain in most people. It is often associated with other symptoms that reflect damage to the left side of the brain or areas close to the language centers. For example, patients may have trouble moving or coordinating the right side of their body, have problems with their speech, or may have cognitive issues. However, aphasia in and of itself does not mean that someone has cognitive problems outside of language. In fact, many patients with aphasia may seem cognitively impaired because they have a hard time understanding or producing language. This can be very frustrating to patients and loved ones.</p>



<p>Patients with aphasia may have nonlanguage impairments, especially ones that reflect damage to the left half of the brain. However, aphasia does not imply cognitive impairment, and many patients with aphasia seem more cognitively impaired than they truly are.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is aphasia treated?</strong></h2>



<p>Treatment of aphasia can be divided into three categories. The first set of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aphasia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369523?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatments</a> applies to all or most patients with aphasia and are focused on improving or maintaining someone’s ability to communicate. This includes speech and language therapy, communication strategies for family and friends, and, in some cases, assistive devices, such as text-to-speech applications. The second set of treatments depend on the underlying&nbsp;cause&nbsp;of the aphasia. For example, if someone has aphasia from a stroke, there may be specific treatments needed to address the stroke and prevent further strokes.</p>



<p>Similarly, if someone has aphasia from a progressive brain disease there may be further tests or treatments available. The final set of treatments address other symptoms that may accompany the aphasia. For instance, if patients also have problems with their speech or with their vision because of damage to those areas occurred along with the aphasia, they may need specific rehabilitation and strategies to deal with those.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some treatments apply to just about everyone with aphasia, such as speech therapy. However, other treatments depend on the cause, and so it is crucial to get an accurate diagnosis in terms of the cause of a patient's aphasia.</p>

<p>Lyme disease&nbsp;is a bacterial infection caused by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, commonly known as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/multimedia/deer-tick/img-20007610?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deer tick</a>.</p>



<p>It is most common in the Upper Midwest and the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. And it's also common in Europe, Asia, and in south-central and southeastern Canada.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms</h2>



<p>Patients may present with a rash at the site of the tick bite — classically with a bull's-eye rash. But that's not always the case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Also, some people may have a rash and not know if it's on the back of their head or another hard-to-see&nbsp;and&nbsp;hard-to-reach area. If the infection is not treated right away, the patient may then&nbsp;progress to having other symptoms, like disseminated rashes, joint pain, arthritis and even neurologic involvement. And they can even have one-sided facial paralysis, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bells-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370028?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bell's palsy</a>," says Dr. Pritt.</p>



<p>Lab tests help confirm or rule out diagnoses of Lyme disease. Dr. Pritt says that <a href="https://news.mayocliniclabs.com/about-us/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Laboratories </a>perform more than 300,000 tests for tick-borne diseases each year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to seek medical care</h2>



<p>Dr. Pritt says that finding a tick on you and removing it promptly is not a reason to seek medical attention, especially for those living where ticks are a daily occurrence.</p>



<p>However, "If a patient lives in an area where there's a lot of Lyme disease, finding a tick that's been attached to them for more than 24 hours, ideally more than 36 hours, that in and of itself is enough to prompt them to go to their physician to see if they should get some antibiotics to prevent Lyme disease," she says.</p>



<p>"If someone were to present with any illness during the spring, summer or fall months when they have been exposed to ticks — where they may have a rash, a headache, a fever — those could all be signs of tick-borne diseases, Lyme disease and other diseases. And that should prompt them to go to their physician," says Dr. Pritt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h2>



<p>The best way to avoid infection is to avoid getting a tick bite. Dr. Pritt says it's important for people to protect themselves from tick bites. Avoiding tick bites will protect them not just from Lyme disease, but also many other tick-borne infections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tick bite prevention tips:</p>



<ul>
<li>When possible, avoid areas where ticks are frequently found.</li>



<li>Use a repellent with 30% or more of DEET.</li>



<li>Wear clothing that covers your arms and legs.</li>



<li>Tuck pants into socks while hiking.</li>
</ul>



<p>"I also like oil of lemon eucalyptus, shown by the Environmental Protection Agency to be almost as effective as DEET, and smells a little better. Also, wearing permethrin sprayed on clothing is helpful. That also will repel and even kill ticks. Then, just cover up with clothing so that the ticks can't get to your skin. If you tuck your pants into your socks, you're taking away an avenue for ticks to get to your legs to bite you," she says.</p>

<p>More than 60 years ago, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5480854/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pioneering researcher</a> showed how a pulse of electricity to a charging bull's brain could be used to stop the animal in its tracks.

A Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon and his colleagues believe one form of that treatment, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep brain stimulation (DBS)</a>, is poised to solve one of the greatest public health challenges: drug addiction.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="597" height="398" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Kendall-Lee.jpg" alt="Image of Kendall Lee, M.D., Ph.D." class="wp-image-382295" style="width:313px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Kendall-Lee.jpg 597w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Kendall-Lee-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kendall Lee, M.D., Ph.D., has advanced DBS, a neurosurgical procedure that uses implanted electrodes and electrical stimulation to treat movement disorders and psychiatric conditions.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Drug addiction is a huge, unmet medical need," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lee-kendall-h-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendall Lee, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, who has published nearly 100 journal articles on DBS along with his colleagues. Key to treating it, he says, is cutting off the pleasurable "high" that comes with the addiction — which DBS potentially can do.</p>



<p>"We now have several early studies showing promise in suppressing the rapid increase in dopamine that makes people feel high," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rethinking reward</strong></h2>



<p>In 2023, a record <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">112,000 people</a> in the U.S. died after overdosing on drugs, including illicit drugs and prescription opioids. Even though several psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are available for addiction, as many as 75% to 98% of patients relapse.</p>



<p>"What's unique about addiction is it creates a pattern in the brain that is self-perpetuating. Essentially, the behavior reinforces itself, making it very resistant to intervention," says Mayo Clinic addiction psychiatrist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/oesterle-tyler-s-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20549206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler Oesterle, M.D.</a></p>



<p>The brain is wired to make pleasure a priority. The brain’s reward system connects two tiny regions: the ventral tegmental area, which releases the feel-good chemical dopamine, and the nucleus accumbens, which controls memory and behavior. The former is why you feel a jolt of pleasure after biting into a hamburger. The latter is why your mouth waters whenever you smell someone fire up a grill. Drugs can overload this system, flooding it with dopamine and strengthening the connections that undergird addiction.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="458" height="457" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Hojin-Shin.jpg" alt="Image of Hojin Shin, Ph.D." class="wp-image-382297" style="width:200px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Hojin-Shin.jpg 458w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Hojin-Shin-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Hojin-Shin-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hojin Shin, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But what if you could short-circuit the reward system? If drugs no longer triggered a high, would they be easier to stop using? Preliminary research in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35411483/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animal models and humans</a> suggests that it is possible to curtail drug-seeking behavior by electrically stimulating brain regions associated with reward.</p>



<p>"The results are promising, but we still don’t know how it works," says Mayo Clinic biomedical engineer <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/neural-engineering/about/meet-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hojin Shin, Ph.D.</a> "What we really need is a technique that allows us to see how the brain works and how the brain changes in response to stimulation so we can use that information to improve the treatment."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A dopamine sensor</strong></h2>



<p>As part of the Mayo Clinic Neural Engineering Laboratory, Dr. Shin and his colleague <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/neural-engineering/about/meet-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoonbae Oh, Ph.D.</a>, have been busy devising novel techniques to measure brain chemicals — such as dopamine and serotonin — in real time. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27774784/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent iterations</a> use electrodes composed of flexible carbon fibers thinner than a human hair, wirelessly connected to an electronic circuit that can simultaneously stimulate neurons and detect neurochemicals.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="459" height="574" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Yoonbae-Oh.jpg" alt="Image of Yoonbae Oh, Ph.D." class="wp-image-382298" style="width:200px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Yoonbae-Oh.jpg 459w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Yoonbae-Oh-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Yoonbae Oh, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The researchers have used their innovations to glean important insights into the mechanisms of DBS and addiction. In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36793536/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one study</a>, they used DBS to activate the dopamine-producing ventral tegmental area in rodent brains. Then they administered a hit of a highly addictive stimulant. The experimental DBS treatment cut the flow of dopamine to the nucleus accumbens, the brain’s reward center, by nearly half.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37408764/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another study</a>, the team tested the approach on a rodent model of opioid addiction. When they gave the models a powerful opioid, they saw a spike in dopamine levels. But when they treated the models with DBS before administering the drug, that spike never happened. The experimental treatment also appeared to inhibit respiratory depression, the breathing difficulties responsible for the majority of opioid overdose deaths.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team recently received a grant from the National Institutes of Health <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/3SytIPxgmEywri__9yY6hg/project-details/10477708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to obtain approval for an FDA Investigational Device Exemption</a>, a necessary step for future preclinical studies and clinical trials of this experimental treatment.</p>



<p>"To see addiction as a biological problem, and to address it with biological treatments like this, is a paradigm shift," says Dr. Oesterle. "We know that the standard behavioral or pharmaceutical interventions don't work for everybody. We're pushing the envelope here because we know we need to do something different, truly different, to help people rebuild their lives."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers are studying whether specialized T cells taken from blood could harness the body's immune system to treat or someday cure complex inflammatory diseases.</p>



<p>Researchers are probing whether a subset of T cells known as regulatory T cells, or Tregs, have the power to suppress out-of-control immune responses. If so, they want to know if this could offer a new therapeutic option for chronic inflammation that does not respond to standard treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/faubion-william-a-jr-m-d/bio-00027222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William Faubion, Jr., M.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist who is dean of Research at Mayo Clinic in Arizona and medical director of Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> is leading a team of researchers focused on the therapeutic value of Tregs for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>.</p>



<p>"While many new agents are emerging for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, unfortunately many patients still do not completely respond, leaving a huge unmet need,” says Dr. Faubion. "Tregs are master regulators that control the immune response through many mechanisms; thus, we are interested to learn if they could restore proper immune tolerance."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new approach to cell therapy</strong></h2>



<p>The allure of Tregs lies in their potential to deliver healing messages to diseased tissues while sparing normal tissues. Dr<em>. </em>Faubion's team will study whether Tregs can be loaded with specific receptors to target intestinal inflammatory conditions and restore healthy immune function for patients. Preclinical studies have shown promising results, but engineered Tregs have not yet been studied in humans at Mayo Clinic. Exploring Tregs as a cellular therapy in clinical care would be a new approach for targeting the molecular underpinnings of inflammation and stopping it at its source.</p>



<p>"Many of the current anti-inflammatory medicines have negative side effects, such as infections," says Dr. Faubion. "New solutions are needed. Our hope is to understand whether Treg cell therapy could control symptoms, minimize the risks and be a more convenient form of treatment than currently exists for chronic inflammation."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cellular mechanisms in action</strong></h2>



<p>T cells are a type of white blood cell that act as beacons of protection, triggering the immune system to block viruses, bacteria and abnormal cells that cause disease. However, an "off target" effect of T cells can shift the body's inflammatory system into overdrive and cause it to mistakenly attack healthy tissue. The result can be autoimmune disorders such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriasis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">psoriasis</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and inflammatory bowel diseases like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a>.</p>



<p>Approximately 8% of people in the U.S. have an autoimmune disease, according to the <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/OADR-ORWH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>. Standard therapies can sometimes ease the symptoms but are not a cure.</p>



<p>Tregs, derived from T cells, act as gatekeepers of the immune system. They release anti-inflammatory molecules and growth factors to control the body's immune response. They also prevent new T cells from activating, while recruiting other immune cells to promote a calming, immune-tolerance environment that could control or stop inflammatory disorders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing Tregs for inflammatory disease</strong></h2>



<p>To better understand the clinical potential of these specialized cells, researchers take Tregs from a patient's blood and then modify them for use in clinical trials. The Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics is engineering these cells and establishing a process for isolation, expansion and biomanufacturing. The goal is to ensure the cells meet safety and quality standards for patients in clinical trials.</p>



<p>"On-site facilities at Mayo Clinic allow us to begin the biomanufacturing process without delays and limit the risks to biological integrity that can come with shipping," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, the Michael S. and Mary Sue Shannon Director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "We are excited about the prospect of offering Tregs as an experimental cell therapy that is studied in clinical trials for patients with complex inflammatory diseases." &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Allickson is also the Otto Bremer Trust Director, Biomanufacturing and Product Development, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>A better understanding of Tregs on a molecular level could have clinical value. Mayo Clinic research teams in Arizona are poised to lead this research in collaboration with colleagues in Rochester and Florida.</p>



<p>Dr. Faubion's team hopes to obtain regulatory approval for clinical trials to study Tregs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease by the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>

<p>Sodium is a mineral that your body needs to function well. When you combine sodium with the mineral, chloride, the two make table salt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sodium is added to many processed foods, including packaged and frozen meals. Many recipes call for salt in the ingredients, and many people add table salt to their food for flavor. But according to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-ivan-e-ii-m-d/bio-20113830?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ivan Porter II</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/nephrology-hypertension/sections/overview/ovc-20464571?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nephrologist</a>, adding too much salt to your diet is not a good thing. A recent <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2813410?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=122823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that adding salt to your food can increase your risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic kidney disease</a>.</p>

<p>Your kidneys balance the amount of sodium in your body. If you're getting too much, it builds up in your blood. Your heart works harder to pump and increases blood pressure, raising the risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/multimedia/vid-20522473?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney disease</a>.</p>



<p>"Chronic kidney disease — that's the way that we describe what occurs when the kidney has issues with filtering wastes and toxins from the blood," says Dr. Porter.</p>



<p>Sodium is added to most processed foods. It's also in a lot of condiments. "So it's very easy for us to get way more sodium than we need. And it's very easy for us to get a dangerous amount of sodium that has some impact on our blood pressure or our overall health," he says.</p>



<p>The recommended daily limit of sodium is 2,300 milligrams, or about 1 teaspoon. Dr. Porter recommends reading food labels. And cut back on the saltshaker by using salt-free seasonings.</p>



<p>"Sometimes you can either stop or reverse some of the initial damage that happens with chronic kidney disease. The longer that the process goes on, the more severe it is, the less likely it is to be able to get back to healthy kidneys. And that's when we have to think about things to replace kidney function like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/dialysis-programs/overview/ovc-20464948?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialysis</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a>," he says.</p>

<p>Approximately half of the world's population lives in areas vulnerable to dengue fever, particularly in hot and humid tropical and subtropical climates.</p>



<p>"That's why you see it in parts of the world such as Southeast Asia, South America, the Caribbean, and even some parts of the southern U.S., around Florida and Louisiana.," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>The primary transmitter of dengue fever is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, known to bite during both day and night. About 1 in 4 people infected with the virus will experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of dengue fever</h2>



<p>"They usually notice fevers, body aches, bone aches, muscle aches; many times, they even describe an aching behind their eyes. They can get some nausea, vomiting and even diarrhea," Dr. Rizza says.</p>



<p>While most people recover within about a week, severe cases can lead to life-threatening emergencies.</p>



<p>Symptoms of severe dengue fever may include:</p>



<p>• Severe stomach pain.<br>• Persistent vomiting.<br>• Bleeding from your gums or nose.<br>• Blood in your urine, stool or vomit.<br>• Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising.<br>• Difficult or rapid breathing.<br>• Fatigue.<br>• Irritability or restlessness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no medicine to treat dengue fever.</p>



<p>"There's no antiviral or no treatment for dengue fever," she says. "It's what we call supportive therapy. Maintaining good hydration, particularly as people are sick and having fevers, is important. They can use acetaminophen to take care of the fevers, bring down the temperature, and then ensure they take in fluids and still get some form of eating."</p>



<p>"If they become severely ill and aren't able to keep up with their fluid status, they should go to their hospital and may require hospitalization to help support them," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>Though there is no direct treatment, a vaccine is approved in many countries for children ages 9 -16 who have previously shown evidence of dengue infection. Dr. Rizza says the vaccine is not approved in the U.S.</p>



<p>"You give it to people who have already had immunologic evidence of a previous dengue infection, and then you give it to them to help prevent them from becoming reinfected," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h2>



<p>Preventing mosquito bites is vital to avoiding dengue fever. Here are some strategies:</p>



<p>• Use bug spray with DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus to prevent mosquito bites.<br>• Remove any stagnant water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.<br>• Eliminate items that hold water, such as vases and flowerpot saucers.<br>• Ensure intact window screens and closed doors to keep mosquitoes outside.<br>• Wear protective clothing like long sleeves and pants.</p>



<p>The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for several viral infections, including dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika.</p>

<p>Gynecologic cancers target the female reproductive system. This includes cancer of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovaries</a>, fallopian tubes, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uterus</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervix</a>, vulva and vagina. About 100,000 women are diagnosed yearly. However, outcomes are different for minority women.</p>



<p>"We do see, unfortunately, elevated mortality rates in Black and Hispanic women in gynecologic cancer," says Dr. Butler.</p>

<p>She says there are several socioeconomic factors that play a role in gynecologic cancer disparities. Obesity, diabetes and hypertension also contribute to cancer risks.</p>



<p>"I think that the healthcare disparities involve comorbidities of these patients, access for these patients, transportation," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>She says finding a healthcare professional you're comfortable with, getting vaccinated against HPV, and undergoing regular pelvic exams and/or Pap tests are crucial.</p>



<p>"This is tremendously important because catching and screening these abnormalities and cancers early improves long-term outcomes for women," explains Dr. Butler.</p>



<p><strong>Gynecologic cancer symptoms</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Vaginal bleeding.</li>



<li>Abnormal discharge.</li>



<li>Pelvic pain or pressure is common for ovarian and uterine cancers.</li>



<li>Itching, burning, pain, or tenderness of the vulva.</li>
</ul>
