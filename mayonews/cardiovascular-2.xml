<p>New research from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) could improve the diagnosis of peripartum <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">cardiomyopathy</a>, a potentially life-threatening and treatable condition that weakens the heart muscle of women during pregnancy or in the months after giving birth. Researchers used an AI-enabled digital stethoscope that captures <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983">electrocardiogram</a> (ECG) data and heart sounds to identify twice as many cases of peripartum cardiomyopathy as compared to regular care,<a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/ai-technology-improved-detection-of-heart-disease-during-and-after-pregnancy"> according to a news</a> release from the American Heart Association.</p>



<p>Identifying a weak heart pump caused by pregnancy is important because the symptoms, such as shortness of breath when lying down, swelling of hands and feet, weight gain, and rapid heartbeat, can be confused with normal symptoms of pregnancy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20502753">Dr. Demilade Adedinsewo</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic, shared research insights during a late-breaking science presentation at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2023.</p>



<p>Women in Nigeria have the highest reported incidence of peripartum cardiomyopathy. The randomized pragmatic clinical trial enrolled 1,195 women receiving pregnancy care in Nigeria. Approximately half were evaluated with AI-guided screening using the digital stethoscope, and half received usual obstetric care in addition to a clinical ECG. An <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856">echocardiogram</a> was used to confirm when the AI-enabled digital stethoscope predicted peripartum cardiomyopathy. Overall, 4% of the pregnant and postpartum women in the intervention arm of the clinical trial had cardiomyopathy compared to 2% in the control arm, suggesting that half are likely undetected with usual care.</p>

<p>In Steve Bernstein, M.D.'s neighborhood, Halloween is a fun time for children and families. Dressed in their costumes, they visit neighbors' homes; the chorus of "Trick or Treat" rings out as goodies are dropped in their bags.</p>



<p>Halloween 2022 was particularly remarkable for Dr. Bernstein, however. He'd undergone a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement surgery just four days earlier but now felt well enough to join the trick-or-treaters.</p>



<p>Dr. Bernstein's path to this remarkable recovery started many years earlier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An unlikely diagnosis</h2>



<p>The 65-year-old is a urologist in Minneapolis, seeing patients with prostate, bladder or kidney conditions. Dr. Bernstein also has a passion for action, from sailboat racing to vigorous bicycling, which at times has led to an injury.</p>



<p>During an emergency department visit in 2015 for a broken foot, he was diagnosed with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-murmurs/symptoms-causes/syc-20373171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart murmur</a>. Dr. Berstein was surprised. With no heart murmur symptoms, like shortness of breath, chest pain or dizziness, he had been unaware of the condition affecting his heart. The emergency department team recommended a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist.</p>



<p>The exam and testing by a cardiologist determined that Dr. Bernstein had aortic regurgitation and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/left-ventricular-hypertrophy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374319" target="_blank">left ventricular hypertrophy</a>. Aortic valve regurgitation causes the valve between the lower left chamber and the body's main artery to not close tightly. As a result, blood can lead backward out of the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber.</p>



<p>Left ventricular hypertrophy develops gradually, and some people, like Dr. Bernstein, don't have symptoms. Symptoms can develop, however, as the thickening in the heart walls makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the body effectively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A holding pattern</h2>



<p>After the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy, Dr. Bernstein continued with his medical practice and enthusiasm for sailing and biking. His cardiologist monitored his condition for the next seven years.</p>



<p>During that time, he knew he eventually would need a procedure to address the aortic stenosis. When the valve narrows, the heart must work harder to pump blood into the aorta.</p>



<p>In 2022, Dr. Bernstein and his cardiologist decided it was time to take action with an aortic valve replacement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Researching the best treatment</h2>



<p>During aortic valve replacement, a surgeon removes the damaged valve and replaces it with a mechanical valve, or one made from cow, pig or human heart tissue. The valve replacement may be done through traditional open-heart surgery, also called a midline sternotomy, which involves an incision in the middle of the chest and dividing the sternum or breastbone. A more minimally invasive method uses a smaller incision in the chest or a catheter inserted in the leg.</p>



<p>Bernstein began extensive research on aortic valve replacement surgery and called on his colleagues for recommendations for a cardiovascular surgeon.</p>



<p>"Anyone who has kidney or prostate surgery is going to have trepidation about it; there's no denying that," says Dr. Bernstein. "The trepidation before open-heart surgery is even greater, and I had some of that."</p>



<p>His research led him to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/robert-wiechmann-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Wiechmann, M.D.</a>, at Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eau Claire</a>, Wisconsin. Dr. Wiechmann and the surgery team perform a minimally invasive procedure to insert a mechanical valve through a small incision in the right chest, providing the same result as traditional open-heart surgery.</p>



<p>"It wasn't just that I got a thumbs up on Dr. Wiechmann, it was the credentials of the people who gave him a thumbs up," says Dr. Bernstein. "It's one thing to ask friends on Facebook, but when you talk to senior cardiac surgeons around the country, and they give a thumbs up — to me, that gives it a lot of clout."</p>



<p>The reputation that Dr. Wiechmann and the Mayo Clinic Health System <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire/services-and-treatments/cardiac-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac surgery</a> team have established around the country led Dr. Bernstein to determine he would have his surgery in Eau Claire.</p>



<p>"I made the decision to drive a few hundred miles to get the best possible treatment for my particular condition. I left a big city — with a big academic, highly regarded medical center — to go to the relatively small city of Eau Claire because I thought it was that important of an investment to make," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Care like clockwork</h2>



<p>After deciding to have Dr. Wiechmann perform the aortic valve replacement, Dr. Bernstein was scheduled for a pre-op physical exam and bloodwork.</p>



<p>"I drove to Eau Claire, and everything went like a Swiss watch. And that's very reassuring for someone who's going to have surgery," he says. "The trepidation balanced with my confidence in the surgeon, his team and the health system."</p>



<p>Several weeks later, Dr. Bernstein returned to Eau Claire for the surgery.</p>



<p>"The cardiothoracic surgery team at Mayo Clinic Health System is leading the field in bringing the latest advances in cardiac surgery to patients," says Dr. Wiechmann. "The team specializes in performing minimally invasive surgical procedures, which provide a quicker, less painful recovery to help people, like Dr. Bernstein, get back to doing the activities they enjoy sooner."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A remarkable recovery</h2>



<p>Following the successful surgery, Dr. Bernstein was moved to the ICU.</p>



<p>"The pain was well-controlled; it was uncomfortable, but not horrible. I was less uncomfortable than I expected," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Bernstein had been told to expect to be in the hospital for four to six days to regain strength and monitor his heart. By Sunday, just two days after surgery, he felt pretty good.</p>



<p>On Monday morning, Dr. Wiechmann checked on his patient and, after the exam, didn't find a reason to keep him in the hospital any longer.</p>



<p>"Dr. Bernstein's active lifestyle and good physical health before his surgery played a role in his rapid recovery in the hospital," says Dr. Wiechmann.</p>



<p>Although his inpatient stay was short, Dr. Bernstein appreciated his interactions with the care team.</p>



<p>"All of the touchpoints that I had when I was there were outstanding, from the nurses at the bedside managing all the tubes and fluids, the X-ray people who took my picture every morning, Dr. Wiechmann's nurse practitioner, physician assistant and the housekeeping and dietary people. All the people, without fail — everyone was professional and compassionate," says Dr. Bernstein.</p>



<p>The at-home preparations done in advance for his recovery, including obtaining a shower chair, turned out to be unnecessary. Showering, dressing and moving around the house proved to be easier than he had expected.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting back on the bike</h2>



<p>For the next two weeks, Dr. Bernstein stayed active by walking in the local mall. Three weeks after the surgery, he was anxious to get back on his exercise bike.</p>



<p>Dr. Wiechmann agreed he could start slowly with a low-resistance, 20-minute ride. With no issues from the initial biking exercise, Dr. Bernstein continued to increase his activity level and duration.</p>



<p>By Thanksgiving weekend, just four weeks after surgery, he was ready to ride his snow bike with studded tires outside in the crisp fall weather.</p>



<p>Although Dr. Bernstein felt well enough to return to work after just six weeks, he took the recommended 12 weeks off. By then, he was back to 100% health with no deficiencies after the surgery and ready to rejoin his busy medical practice.</p>



<p>While the routine post-op follow-up visit is typically done in person at the hospital, Dr. Bernstein was able to do his post-op appointment using telehealth with Dr. Wiechmann's nurse practitioner.</p>



<p>"The incision is basically invisible. It looks like a plastic surgeon closed it," says Dr. Bernstein.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Going forward</h2>



<p>Dr. Bernstein continued his heart care with his cardiologist after the surgery and recovery. A postoperative echocardiogram was performed to look at his heart and establish a new baseline. The echocardiogram showed a typical result for heart function.</p>



<p>"So the beginning of hypertrophy of the left ventricle has resolved, as Dr. Wiechmann suspected it would, and my heart is normal after the aortic valve replacement," says Dr. Bernstein.</p>



<p>"Treating complex cardiac conditions with a minimally invasive approach provides the best outcome possible for candidates of the surgery," explains Dr. Wiechmann. "The goal is to provide the highest-quality heart care for our patients."</p>



<p>With his background in healthcare leadership, Dr. Bernstein is experienced in evaluating care to look for opportunities to increase efficiency, decrease cost or improve patient experience.</p>



<p>"As I look back on my experience with heart surgery, I can't find anything to improve. I couldn't recommend Dr. Weichmann and his team more strongly for patients with surgical heart valve disease."</p>

The good news: Angina often is treatable. The bad news: While people may think angina affects only the elderly, it can occur in younger people too.</p>



<p>The pain of angina can vary widely. Most often, it is an uncomfortable feeling of heaviness, tightness or constriction, like there is a tight band around the chest, Dr. Brecker says. Other symptoms can include sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea and fatigue. Discomfort may also be felt in the teeth, jaw, neck or back.</p>

<p>While angina is most common in people over 60, it is not confined to older people.</p>



<p>"We see many young patients who have developed premature coronary disease or have a familial tendency to high cholesterol," Dr. Brecker says.</p>



<p>Lifestyle-related factors, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/chronic-stress-can-wreak-havoc-on-your-mind-and-body/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress</a>, smoking, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/secondhand-smoke/faq-20058082?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secondhand smoke</a> exposure and lack of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise</a>, can raise the risk.

<p>Angina typically is diagnosed using medical imaging, such as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/diagnostics/echocardiogram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT coronary angiogram</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/diagnostics/echocardiogram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress echocardiogram</a> and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, also known as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/diagnostics/cardiac-mri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac MRI</a>. Stress tests, which measure blood flow to the heart muscle during exercise, and blood tests may be a useful part of the assessment</p>



<p>Treatment for angina can include lifestyle changes, medication, the insertion of a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angioplasty/about/pac-20384761?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tiny balloon or stents</a> to open clogged arteries, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-bypass-surgery/about/pac-20384589?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary bypass surgery</a>.</p>



<p>"The vast majority of cases of coronary artery disease can now be treated very effectively," Dr. Brecker says. "Even with the most advanced forms of coronary disease, there are now effective treatments to increase blood flow to the heart muscle."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Artificial intelligence (AI) from patient electrocardiograms (ECGs) may be an innovative solution to enhance heart disease risk assessment. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atherosclerotic</a> cardiovascular disease — arteries narrowed or blocked by the accumulation of fatty plaques — is the leading global cause of death and is often driven by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>. New <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00436-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study data published in eClinicalMedicine</a> suggest that ECG-AI can flag some risks years sooner than current risk calculator equations by identifying signs of coronary artery disease, such as calcification and blockages, as well as evidence of a prior heart attack.</p>



<p>Many people may have coronary artery disease and not be aware of it. Unfortunately, the first sign of the disease could be sudden death or a major heart attack. Clinician tools, such as the pooled cohort equation, help determine a patient's 10-year risk for heart attacks and strokes. The tools guide shared decisions about the timing of therapies, but these tools have limitations.</p>



<p>ECG is a widely available test that measures the heart's electrical activity, and AI can be trained to identify and detect hidden patterns of disease from those electrical signals.</p>



<p>The ECG-AI to predict coronary artery disease was developed at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> and <a href="https://anumana.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anumana</a> using the retrospective analysis of electronic health data of over 7 million patients across the U.S. Three separate ECG-AI models were trained, one each to detect coronary artery calcium, coronary artery blockage and segments of the heart's left ventricle not moving well — a sign of a prior heart attack.</p>



<p>"Used together, the three independent ECG-AI models predicted which patients had a high risk of hidden coronary artery disease, and therefore a high risk of having a heart attack. This is important information to guide our conversations with patients at the point of care, especially since the AI was useful in calculating these risks for as short as three years," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the paper. "Used alone, the pooled cohort equation estimates the 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The addition of ECG-AI to see hidden risks sooner has the potential to save more lives. This model may also help identify people who do not know they have coronary disease who may benefit from lifesaving therapies."</p>



<p>The study was funded by Anumana, a spinoff company of nference and Mayo Clinic. Mayo Clinic has licensed this technology to Anumana. Mayo Clinic and authors of this study may benefit financially in the future if this technology is commercialized.</p>

<p>A recent Mayo Clinic<a>&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.122.028734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;of residents living in a mostly rural, 11‐county region of southeast Minnesota found that patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a> and multiple social risk factors were more likely than other heart failure patients to experience adverse outcomes such as emergency department visits, hospitalization, delayed recovery and reduced quality of life.</p>



<p>Researchers investigated the effect of social factors, including education, isolation and "community deprivation" — a lack of community resources and opportunities measured at the community level.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Savitz-Samuel-T._20498616_202009010234.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376284" style="aspect-ratio:0.83375;width:224px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Savitz-Samuel-T._20498616_202009010234.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Savitz-Samuel-T._20498616_202009010234-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Samuel Savitz, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"The findings suggest that it is possible to identify a small but meaningful subset of patients with heart failure who have multiple, co-occurring social risk factors and may be at greater risk for poor health outcomes," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/savitz-samuel-sam-t-ph-d/bio-20503199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Savitz, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic health services researcher and lead author of the study.</p>



<p>Researchers used a statistical method to categorize 3,142 patients with heart failure. They all were living in an 11‐county region of southeast Minnesota and were 18 years or older with a first‐ever diagnosis of heart failure. The average age was 73.4, with 45.2% of the patients being women.</p>



<p>Researchers divided them into four groups based on living environments and other social risk factors.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Group 1</strong>&nbsp;had 1,093 patients living in urban areas with moderate social risk factors.</li>



<li><strong>Group 2</strong>&nbsp;had 531 patients living in rural areas with similar risk factors.</li>



<li><strong>Group 3</strong>&nbsp;had 185 patients and was considered moderately rural with multiple social risk factors.</li>



<li><strong>Group 4</strong>, the reference group, had 1,333 patients and consisted of mostly urban areas with higher education levels and fewer social risk challenges.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key findings</strong></h2>



<p>According to the study, patients in Group 3 — living in a moderately rural area and facing the most social risk factors — used more healthcare services than those in Group 4, who had higher education levels and more access to community resources.</p>



<p>Patients in Group 1 — living in urban areas — had better outcomes than those in the "mostly urban" Group 4, despite having more social risk factors. The researchers suggest this was likely due to better access to care within their urban community.</p>



<p>The research also revealed that approximately 18.2% of patients within the study experienced moderate social isolation, while 5.7% experienced high social isolation, indicating a lack of social connections or support.</p>



<p>"This study provides further evidence that health systems and policymakers should devote resources and develop interventions to address the effects of social risk factors on patient outcomes," says&nbsp;Dr. Savitz.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking a Patient-Centered Approach</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Savitz said the study also shows that heart failure cannot be treated in isolation but should be viewed through a broader lens of the patient’s life circumstances. Future interventions, he says, could use a patient-centered approach to address social risk factors.</p>



<p>He notes that it is crucial to evaluate whether these findings extend to other regions of the country, particularly those with greater racial and ethnic diversity.</p>

<p></p>



<p>"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" is an adage that Mayo Clinic cardiologist Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez says remains true today.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-360607 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat.jpg 1687w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"No matter how difficult prevention might look, it is way better than treating heart disease."</p><cite>Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p></p>
</div></div>



<p>And prevention, he says, can start small by focusing on the simple things, like&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-8-heart-healthy-diet-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diet</a>&nbsp;and exercise.</p>



<p>"Trying to eat healthier a little bit at a time, to move around through the day, avoiding sitting for too long," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>A positive outlook also can go far in your physical well-being. Enjoy a walk with a friend, for instance.</p>



<p>"Trying to find purpose every day, and trying to give love every day, because those are some of the emotional things that we don't take care of (that) also affect the heart," he says.</p>



<p>And finally, he says if you are prescribed medication for high&nbsp;blood pressure or high&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>, avoid the risk of a heart attack and follow your doctor's orders.</p>



<p>"Take those medications, check your numbers and be sure that all those factors are well under control," Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips and strategies for a heart-healthy diet</h3>

<p>Sudden cardiac arrest is among the leading causes of death in the U.S., and this year alone, more than 350,000 people will experience <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest</a>. In the hospital setting, defibrillators are used to deliver a jolt of electricity to the person's chest to get the heart beating again. Outside of the hospital, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/in-depth/automated-external-defibrillators/art-20043909" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">automated external defibrillators (AEDs)</a> are portable devices that are used to revive someone suffering cardiac arrest. AEDs can be found in many public places and don’t require any special training to use. However, knowing where to look for them and how to use them could potentially help save someone’s life.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/gallo-de-moraes-alice-m-d/bio-20337269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Alice Gallo De Moraes</a> is chair of Mayo Clinic's Medical Emergency Response Subcommittee, which oversees all cardiac arrests and rapid response at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. She wants people to feel empowered to use these lifesaving devices.</p>

<p>"I really want people not to be afraid to use an AED because applying an AED to someone who has collapsed and doesn't have a pulse can actually save their life and save their life in a way that they won't have long-lasting consequences," says Dr. Gallo De Moraes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to use an AED</h2>



<p>If someone has fainted and might need an AED:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Check to see if the person is breathing and has a pulse.</strong></li>



<li><strong>If you cannot feel a pulse and the person is not breathing, call for emergency help.</strong> If there are other people present, one person can call 911 while the other prepares the AED. If you're alone, call 911 or emergency services first to make sure help is on the way.</li>



<li><strong>Turn on the AED.</strong> The automated external defibrillator gives you step-by-step voice instructions. It will tell you how to check for breathing and pulse and how to position electrode pads on the person's bare chest.</li>



<li><strong>Deliver the shock.</strong> When the pads are in place, the AED automatically measures the person's heart rhythm and determines if a shock is needed. If it is, the machine tells the user to stand back and push a button to deliver the shock. The AED is programmed not to deliver a shock if a shock isn't needed.</li>



<li><strong>Start CPR.</strong> Begin CPR after the shock is delivered if CPR is still needed. The AED also will guide users through CPR. The process can be repeated as needed until emergency crews take over.</li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. Gallo De Moraes says CPR is the most important thing to do after the shock of the AED is delivered.</p>



<p>"Once you start chest compressions, the AED will give you a countdown clock for two minutes, and it will remind you to stop compressions at two minutes so it can analyze again," says Dr. Gallo De Moraes.</p>



<p>She says if the audio instructions are followed, there’s no way to further hurt or injure someone by using an AED.</p>



<p>AED devices are often found in public places, such as schools, sports stadiums and airports, and are also carried by emergency medical services. AEDs should be in easily accessible and visible locations where they can quickly be retrieved in the event of a sudden cardiac arrest. Signs with the AED heart-shaped symbol should be located above where the devices are located.</p>

<p>Lubb-dupp. Lubb-dupp. Those are the words that healthcare professionals often use to mimic the sound of your heartbeat. That steady, regular sound is made by your heart valves opening and closing as blood circulates through your heart.</p>



<p>You may have heard the term "heart murmur.” A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-murmurs/basics/definition/con-20028706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">murmur</a>&nbsp;is an extra heart sound that can be heard by a stethoscope. Sometimes, the murmur sounds like a humming, which can be faint or loud. It might be temporary or persistent. Heart murmurs may be present at birth or develop later in life during pregnancy, phases of rapid growth like adolescence or from a fever or anemia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The murmur may disappear as quickly as it comes if it has a temporary cause. However, a murmur also could be persistent and loud, easily heard and sound like a churning mill wheel or cooing seagull. This might indicate a serious heart problem.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What causes a heart murmur?</h3>



<p>Multiple factors can cause a murmur.&nbsp;It could be a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-valve-disease/basics/definition/con-20036065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart valve problem</a>&nbsp;or a hole in the heart.</p>



<p>The valves in your heart act as doors between the chambers, or rooms, of the heart. In the case of a murmur, a valve may be tight or leaky. When heart valves are very tight or narrow, this is called stenosis. A murmur also might be from a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/treating-mitral-valve-regurgitation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaky valve</a>, called regurgitation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A murmur also may occur from high blood flow in people with a fever or with low red blood cells, called anemia.</p>



<p>Some people have a family history of heart murmur and heart disease.&nbsp;Some are born with a&nbsp;congenital condition causing a murmur. Others have had a recent severe infection or illness that could damage a heart valve and need immediate medical attention.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are the symptoms?</h3>



<p>Innocent or harmless heart murmurs don't typically cause symptoms, and most aren't serious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Symptoms of a serious or worrisome heart murmur depend on the cause and require evaluation by a healthcare professional. These symptoms may include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Blue or gray lips or fingernails</li>



<li>Chest pain</li>



<li>Fainting&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fever&nbsp;</li>



<li>Leg swelling&nbsp;</li>



<li>Lingering cough</li>



<li>Shortness of breath</li>



<li>Sudden weight gain</li>



<li>Swollen liver or neck veins</li>



<li>Worsening fatigue</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How is it diagnosed?</h3>



<p>It’s common for a heart murmur to be detected during a physical exam being given for another reason. If a healthcare professional hears a murmur, you'll be asked questions about your personal and family history that could indicate a reason for the murmur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several criteria are used to determine if a murmur is innocent or worrisome, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Volume —&nbsp;</strong>The loudness of the murmur is evaluated on a scale from 1 to 6. The loudest heart murmur is a 6.</li>



<li><strong>Location —&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The location of the murmur in the heart will be identified, along with whether the sound spreads to the neck or back.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Pitch —&nbsp;</strong>The murmur may be high-, medium- or low-pitched.</li>



<li><strong>Timing of the murmur —&nbsp;</strong>A murmur that occurs when blood leaves the heart is a systolic murmur. A murmur that occurs when the heart fills with blood is called a diastolic murmur. A murmur also may be heard throughout the heartbeat. When the murmur is heard as blood passes through the heart, it may be a sign of a larger heart problem.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>You will need to undergo testing to determine the cause of the heart murmur. Your healthcare professional will likely order an ultrasound picture of your heart, called an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/basics/definition/prc-20013918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>&nbsp;or echo, to show detailed images of your heart’s valves, chambers, structure and function.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/DrReviewsEchocardiogram-1024x682.jpg" alt="Closeup of Dr. Jae Oh, MD, Cardiology Consultant, reviewing echocardiogram results on monitor which can detect a heart murmur " class="wp-image-375111" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/DrReviewsEchocardiogram-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/DrReviewsEchocardiogram-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/DrReviewsEchocardiogram-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/DrReviewsEchocardiogram-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/DrReviewsEchocardiogram.jpg 1688w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A doctor reviews an echocardiogram </figcaption></figure>



<p>Once the cause has been found, some people will need repeated evaluation. Others may need surgery to treat the cause of the murmur, especially if it is to adjust a tight or leaky valve or to close a hole in the heart.</p>



<p>In some situations, people may need to take antibiotics before going to a dentist to protect the heart valves from potential infection. This infection, called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endocarditis/basics/definition/con-20022403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endocarditis</a>, can be spread via the bloodstream during dental work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to learn if a heart murmur is innocent or serious so you can get the proper treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Physiologically, AugMAP can be considered a marker of global left ventricular contractile function," says Chieh-Ju Chao, M.D., senior associate consultant in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Department of Cardiovascular Medicine</a> and the study's first author. "AugMAP is easily calculated from the patient's blood pressure and mean aortic gradient, and we found that low AugMAP is associated with higher mortality in all moderate aortic stenosis patient subgroups."</p>



<p>Aortic stenosis is one of the most common cardiac valvular abnormalities, affecting about 5% of people older than 65 years. For most patients with moderate aortic stenosis, clinical guidelines call only for periodic monitoring with echocardiography, a test that uses sound waves to show how blood moves through the heart. However, growing evidence shows that patients with moderate aortic stenosis have poor longer-term survival rates and could benefit from earlier intervention.</p>



<p>The study looked at 4,563 patients with moderate aortic stenosis who were treated at Mayo Clinic from January 2010 through December 2020. The findings indicate that AugMAP is a better prognostic tool compared to other available measures and can detect early-stage left ventricular dysfunction before a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction is observed. "With this information, we can identify patients at higher risk of mortality with current management strategies and initiate discussion about other treatment strategies," says Dr. Chao.</p>



<p>"Moderate aortic stenosis does carry a higher risk of morbidity and mortality compared to the general population based on several prior studies," says senior author <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/arsanjani-reza-m-d/bio-20163932?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reza Arsanjani, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.&nbsp;"Current guidelines recommend active surveillance although earlier intervention might benefit select patients.&nbsp;Our study could potentially identify high-risk individuals who might benefit from earlier intervention."</p>



<p>The authors say future studies should consider whether patients with lower AugMAP can benefit from earlier intervention rather than periodic monitoring.</p>
