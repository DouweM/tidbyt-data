<p>During Thanksgiving, food often takes center stage at gatherings of friends and family. The focus is on turkey, pie and all the sides. But it also can challenge healthy eating habits.</p>



<p>Andrea Delgado, a Mayo Clinic dietitian, says that by paying attention to how much you eat and how often, you can make <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20047702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy food</a> choices during the holidays.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:01) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/SCRIPT-MCM-Making-Healthy-Holiday-Food-Choices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Sit down. Enjoy your holiday meal, says Delgado.</p>



<p>"There's never an all-or-nothing approach in nutrition, you can still enjoy everything in moderation," she says.</p>



<p>Delgado says overindulging during the holidays can be a tipping point for some.</p>



<p>"Maybe now we have a new diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high cholesterol</a> or a new diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prediabetes</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> because, even though we only did it for a short period of time, it was enough that we were close enough to be diagnosed with these new conditions," she says.</p>



<p>One strategy includes weighing your options and making choices.</p>



<p>"Let's say I have a green bean casserole, which is filled with cream of mushroom and a lot of other ingredients, versus just a side of green beans. Your better option would be the green beans," she says.</p>

<p>But what about that pumpkin pie?</p>



<p>"We can still have a small wedge, but maybe we don't add the whipped topping or the additional toppings that we might add typically. It's not really cutting out entire foods. It's more how can we reduce the portion or what we add to those foods," says Delgado.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thanksgiving Day is also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/famhistory/knowing_not_enough.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ffeatures%2Ffamilyhealthhistory%2Findex.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Health History Day</a>, an annual national campaign to promote awareness of hereditary health traits in families.</strong></h3>



<p>Has your grandmother, mother, aunt or sister had breast or ovarian cancer? Has your grandfather, father or uncle had prostate, breast or pancreatic cancer? Is there a history in your family of colon cancer, diabetes or high cholesterol?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If any of these scenarios resonate within your family, you could also be at risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many hereditary health conditions follow patterns within families, with sometimes as high as a 50% likelihood that if one parent possesses a mutated gene, their child will inherit it. Recent Mayo Clinic&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-finds-1-in-8-patients-with-cancer-harbor-inherited-genetic-mutations/">research</a>&nbsp;shows that inherited, faulty genes cause more than 10% of all cancers.</p>



<p>"The biggest advice I would give is that if you are with your family this Thanksgiving, spend a few moments to share some of that family health history information. And if a red flag goes up, report that to your doctor. It could actually save someone's life," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/presutti-richard-john-j-d-o/bio-20053922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Presutti, D.O.</a>, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician and a researcher at the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Predictive power of genomics</strong></h3>



<p>Dr. Presutti has integrated genomics into his everyday medical decision-making for his patients, realizing the potential for improving health outcomes.</p>



<p>"If I can help identify patients at high risk for cancer and other diseases, then I can help get them started on screening earlier and avoid the situation of metastatic cancer and early cancer deaths," he says.</p>



<p>Equally important to the discovery of a person's inherited cancer mutation is the potential for them to share the heritable cause of their disease with their blood relatives, allowing family members to pursue care for earlier disease detection and cancer management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The power of genetics is that we can potentially foresee the cancer that will develop in other family members," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/samadder-niloy-jewel-jewel-j-m-d/bio-20396993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niloy Jewel Samadder, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and cancer geneticist. "This can allow us to target cancer screening to those high-risk individuals and hopefully prevent cancer altogether in the next generation of the family."</p>



<p>Dr. Samadder emphasizes that knowing your family health history can help you, but only if you act on it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Questions to ask family about health history</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Do you have chronic conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol?</li>



<li>Have you had serious diseases, such as cancer or stroke?</li>



<li>How old were you when each of these diseases or health conditions was diagnosed?</li>



<li>What is your family's ancestry? What countries or regions did your ancestors come from?</li>



<li>What were the causes and ages of death for relatives who have died?</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Examples of family health syndromes:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome</a>&nbsp;is an inherited mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Along with breast and ovarian cancer, this syndrome also can lead to male breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>&nbsp;is a cluster of mutations that can boost the risk of a wide range of cancers, including colon, rectal, endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, kidney, brain, uterus and bile duct.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/familial-hypercholesterolemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Familial hypercholesterolemia</a>&nbsp;is a genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol, which can lead to premature cardiovascular disease.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Health history situations that raise a red flag</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>A person developed cancer at an unusually young age.</li>



<li>A person has had several different types of cancer.</li>



<li>Cancer developed in both organs in a set of paired organs, such as both kidneys or both breasts.</li>



<li>Several first-degree relatives ― parents, siblings or a person's children ― have the same type of cancer. Examples might include a mother, daughter and sisters with breast cancer; multiple family members with breast or ovarian cancer; or family members with colon cancer and endometrial cancer.</li>



<li>Unusual cases of a specific cancer type, such as breast cancer in a man.</li>



<li>Being a member of a racial or ethnic group that is known to have an increased risk of having a certain inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome.</li>



<li>Several family members with cancer.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What to do with the information</strong></h3>



<p>If you have a family health history of disease, here are some steps to take:</p>



<ul>
<li>Consult a healthcare professional: Schedule a consultation with a doctor or genetic counselor to discuss your family health history and any potential risks.</li>



<li>Genetic testing: In some cases, your healthcare team may recommend genetic testing to determine whether you have specific genetic mutations or markers associated with hereditary diseases.</li>



<li>Lifestyle modifications: Make lifestyle changes to reduce risk factors, such as maintaining a healthy diet, staying physically active, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption.</li>



<li>Communicate: Keep open lines of communication with family members about their health histories, as it can provide valuable insights for everyone's well-being.</li>
</ul>

<p>New research from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) could improve the diagnosis of peripartum <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">cardiomyopathy</a>, a potentially life-threatening and treatable condition that weakens the heart muscle of women during pregnancy or in the months after giving birth. Researchers used an AI-enabled digital stethoscope that captures <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983">electrocardiogram</a> (ECG) data and heart sounds to identify twice as many cases of peripartum cardiomyopathy as compared to regular care, <a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/ai-technology-improved-detection-of-heart-disease-during-and-after-pregnancy">according to a news</a> release from the American Heart Association.</p>



<p>Identifying a weak heart pump caused by pregnancy is important because the symptoms, such as shortness of breath when lying down, swelling of hands and feet, weight gain, and rapid heartbeat, can be confused with normal symptoms of pregnancy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20502753">Dr. Demilade Adedinsewo</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic, shared research insights during a late-breaking science presentation at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2023.</p>



<p>Women in Nigeria have the highest reported incidence of peripartum cardiomyopathy. The randomized pragmatic clinical trial enrolled 1,195 women receiving pregnancy care in Nigeria. Approximately half were evaluated with AI-guided screening using the digital stethoscope, and half received usual obstetric care in addition to a clinical ECG. An <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856">echocardiogram</a> was used to confirm when the AI-enabled digital stethoscope predicted peripartum cardiomyopathy. Overall, 4% of the pregnant and postpartum women in the intervention arm of the clinical trial had cardiomyopathy compared to 2% in the control arm, suggesting that half are likely undetected with usual care.</p>

<p>In Steve Bernstein, M.D.'s neighborhood, Halloween is a fun time for children and families. Dressed in their costumes, they visit neighbors' homes; the chorus of "Trick or Treat" rings out as goodies are dropped in their bags.</p>



<p>Halloween 2022 was particularly remarkable for Dr. Bernstein, however. He'd undergone a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement surgery just four days earlier but now felt well enough to join the trick-or-treaters.</p>



<p>Dr. Bernstein's path to this remarkable recovery started many years earlier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An unlikely diagnosis</h2>



<p>The 65-year-old is a urologist in Minneapolis, seeing patients with prostate, bladder or kidney conditions. Dr. Bernstein also has a passion for action, from sailboat racing to vigorous bicycling, which at times has led to an injury.</p>



<p>During an emergency department visit in 2015 for a broken foot, he was diagnosed with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-murmurs/symptoms-causes/syc-20373171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart murmur</a>. Dr. Berstein was surprised. With no heart murmur symptoms, like shortness of breath, chest pain or dizziness, he had been unaware of the condition affecting his heart. The emergency department team recommended a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist.</p>



<p>The exam and testing by a cardiologist determined that Dr. Bernstein had aortic regurgitation and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/left-ventricular-hypertrophy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374319" target="_blank">left ventricular hypertrophy</a>. Aortic valve regurgitation causes the valve between the lower left chamber and the body's main artery to not close tightly. As a result, blood can lead backward out of the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber.</p>



<p>Left ventricular hypertrophy develops gradually, and some people, like Dr. Bernstein, don't have symptoms. Symptoms can develop, however, as the thickening in the heart walls makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the body effectively.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A holding pattern</h2>



<p>After the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy, Dr. Bernstein continued with his medical practice and enthusiasm for sailing and biking. His cardiologist monitored his condition for the next seven years.</p>



<p>During that time, he knew he eventually would need a procedure to address the aortic stenosis. When the valve narrows, the heart must work harder to pump blood into the aorta.</p>



<p>In 2022, Dr. Bernstein and his cardiologist decided it was time to take action with an aortic valve replacement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Researching the best treatment</h2>



<p>During aortic valve replacement, a surgeon removes the damaged valve and replaces it with a mechanical valve, or one made from cow, pig or human heart tissue. The valve replacement may be done through traditional open-heart surgery, also called a midline sternotomy, which involves an incision in the middle of the chest and dividing the sternum or breastbone. A more minimally invasive method uses a smaller incision in the chest or a catheter inserted in the leg.</p>



<p>Bernstein began extensive research on aortic valve replacement surgery and called on his colleagues for recommendations for a cardiovascular surgeon.</p>



<p>"Anyone who has kidney or prostate surgery is going to have trepidation about it; there's no denying that," says Dr. Bernstein. "The trepidation before open-heart surgery is even greater, and I had some of that."</p>



<p>His research led him to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/robert-wiechmann-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Wiechmann, M.D.</a>, at Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eau Claire</a>, Wisconsin. Dr. Wiechmann and the surgery team perform a minimally invasive procedure to insert a mechanical valve through a small incision in the right chest, providing the same result as traditional open-heart surgery.</p>



<p>"It wasn't just that I got a thumbs up on Dr. Wiechmann, it was the credentials of the people who gave him a thumbs up," says Dr. Bernstein. "It's one thing to ask friends on Facebook, but when you talk to senior cardiac surgeons around the country, and they give a thumbs up — to me, that gives it a lot of clout."</p>



<p>The reputation that Dr. Wiechmann and the Mayo Clinic Health System <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire/services-and-treatments/cardiac-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac surgery</a> team have established around the country led Dr. Bernstein to determine he would have his surgery in Eau Claire.</p>



<p>"I made the decision to drive a few hundred miles to get the best possible treatment for my particular condition. I left a big city — with a big academic, highly regarded medical center — to go to the relatively small city of Eau Claire because I thought it was that important of an investment to make," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Care like clockwork</h2>



<p>After deciding to have Dr. Wiechmann perform the aortic valve replacement, Dr. Bernstein was scheduled for a pre-op physical exam and bloodwork.</p>



<p>"I drove to Eau Claire, and everything went like a Swiss watch. And that's very reassuring for someone who's going to have surgery," he says. "The trepidation balanced with my confidence in the surgeon, his team and the health system."</p>



<p>Several weeks later, Dr. Bernstein returned to Eau Claire for the surgery.</p>



<p>"The cardiothoracic surgery team at Mayo Clinic Health System is leading the field in bringing the latest advances in cardiac surgery to patients," says Dr. Wiechmann. "The team specializes in performing minimally invasive surgical procedures, which provide a quicker, less painful recovery to help people, like Dr. Bernstein, get back to doing the activities they enjoy sooner."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A remarkable recovery</h2>



<p>Following the successful surgery, Dr. Bernstein was moved to the ICU.</p>



<p>"The pain was well-controlled; it was uncomfortable, but not horrible. I was less uncomfortable than I expected," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Bernstein had been told to expect to be in the hospital for four to six days to regain strength and monitor his heart. By Sunday, just two days after surgery, he felt pretty good.</p>



<p>On Monday morning, Dr. Wiechmann checked on his patient and, after the exam, didn't find a reason to keep him in the hospital any longer.</p>



<p>"Dr. Bernstein's active lifestyle and good physical health before his surgery played a role in his rapid recovery in the hospital," says Dr. Wiechmann.</p>



<p>Although his inpatient stay was short, Dr. Bernstein appreciated his interactions with the care team.</p>



<p>"All of the touchpoints that I had when I was there were outstanding, from the nurses at the bedside managing all the tubes and fluids, the X-ray people who took my picture every morning, Dr. Wiechmann's nurse practitioner, physician assistant and the housekeeping and dietary people. All the people, without fail — everyone was professional and compassionate," says Dr. Bernstein.</p>



<p>The at-home preparations done in advance for his recovery, including obtaining a shower chair, turned out to be unnecessary. Showering, dressing and moving around the house proved to be easier than he had expected.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting back on the bike</h2>



<p>For the next two weeks, Dr. Bernstein stayed active by walking in the local mall. Three weeks after the surgery, he was anxious to get back on his exercise bike.</p>



<p>Dr. Wiechmann agreed he could start slowly with a low-resistance, 20-minute ride. With no issues from the initial biking exercise, Dr. Bernstein continued to increase his activity level and duration.</p>



<p>By Thanksgiving weekend, just four weeks after surgery, he was ready to ride his snow bike with studded tires outside in the crisp fall weather.</p>



<p>Although Dr. Bernstein felt well enough to return to work after just six weeks, he took the recommended 12 weeks off. By then, he was back to 100% health with no deficiencies after the surgery and ready to rejoin his busy medical practice.</p>



<p>While the routine post-op follow-up visit is typically done in person at the hospital, Dr. Bernstein was able to do his post-op appointment using telehealth with Dr. Wiechmann's nurse practitioner.</p>



<p>"The incision is basically invisible. It looks like a plastic surgeon closed it," says Dr. Bernstein.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Going forward</h2>



<p>Dr. Bernstein continued his heart care with his cardiologist after the surgery and recovery. A postoperative echocardiogram was performed to look at his heart and establish a new baseline. The echocardiogram showed a typical result for heart function.</p>



<p>"So the beginning of hypertrophy of the left ventricle has resolved, as Dr. Wiechmann suspected it would, and my heart is normal after the aortic valve replacement," says Dr. Bernstein.</p>



<p>"Treating complex cardiac conditions with a minimally invasive approach provides the best outcome possible for candidates of the surgery," explains Dr. Wiechmann. "The goal is to provide the highest-quality heart care for our patients."</p>



<p>With his background in healthcare leadership, Dr. Bernstein is experienced in evaluating care to look for opportunities to increase efficiency, decrease cost or improve patient experience.</p>



<p>"As I look back on my experience with heart surgery, I can't find anything to improve. I couldn't recommend Dr. Weichmann and his team more strongly for patients with surgical heart valve disease."</p>

<p>LONDON — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/symptoms-causes/syc-20369373?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Angina</a>, chest discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart, is a common symptom of <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas/coronary-artery-disease-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>.

The good news: Angina often is treatable. The bad news: While people may think angina affects only the elderly, it can occur in younger people too.</p>



<p>The pain of angina can vary widely. Most often, it is an uncomfortable feeling of heaviness, tightness or constriction, like there is a tight band around the chest, Dr. Brecker says. Other symptoms can include sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea and fatigue. Discomfort may also be felt in the teeth, jaw, neck or back.</p>

<p>While angina is most common in people over 60, it is not confined to older people.</p>



<p>"We see many young patients who have developed premature coronary disease or have a familial tendency to high cholesterol," Dr. Brecker says.</p>



<p>Lifestyle-related factors, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/chronic-stress-can-wreak-havoc-on-your-mind-and-body/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress</a>, smoking, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/secondhand-smoke/faq-20058082?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secondhand smoke</a> exposure and lack of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise</a>, can raise the risk.

<p>Angina typically is diagnosed using medical imaging, such as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/diagnostics/echocardiogram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT coronary angiogram</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/diagnostics/echocardiogram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress echocardiogram</a> and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, also known as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/diagnostics/cardiac-mri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac MRI</a>. Stress tests, which measure blood flow to the heart muscle during exercise, and blood tests may be a useful part of the assessment</p>



<p>Treatment for angina can include lifestyle changes, medication, the insertion of a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angioplasty/about/pac-20384761?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tiny balloon or stents</a> to open clogged arteries, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-bypass-surgery/about/pac-20384589?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary bypass surgery</a>.</p>



<p>"The vast majority of cases of coronary artery disease can now be treated very effectively," Dr. Brecker says. "Even with the most advanced forms of coronary disease, there are now effective treatments to increase blood flow to the heart muscle."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Artificial intelligence (AI) from patient electrocardiograms (ECGs) may be an innovative solution to enhance heart disease risk assessment. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atherosclerotic</a> cardiovascular disease — arteries narrowed or blocked by the accumulation of fatty plaques — is the leading global cause of death and is often driven by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>. New <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00436-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study data published in eClinicalMedicine</a> suggest that ECG-AI can flag some risks years sooner than current risk calculator equations by identifying signs of coronary artery disease, such as calcification and blockages, as well as evidence of a prior heart attack.</p>



<p>Many people may have coronary artery disease and not be aware of it. Unfortunately, the first sign of the disease could be sudden death or a major heart attack. Clinician tools, such as the pooled cohort equation, help determine a patient's 10-year risk for heart attacks and strokes. The tools guide shared decisions about the timing of therapies, but these tools have limitations.</p>



<p>ECG is a widely available test that measures the heart's electrical activity, and AI can be trained to identify and detect hidden patterns of disease from those electrical signals.</p>



<p>The ECG-AI to predict coronary artery disease was developed at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> and <a href="https://anumana.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anumana</a> using the retrospective analysis of electronic health data of over 7 million patients across the U.S. Three separate ECG-AI models were trained, one each to detect coronary artery calcium, coronary artery blockage and segments of the heart's left ventricle not moving well — a sign of a prior heart attack.</p>



<p>"Used together, the three independent ECG-AI models predicted which patients had a high risk of hidden coronary artery disease, and therefore a high risk of having a heart attack. This is important information to guide our conversations with patients at the point of care, especially since the AI was useful in calculating these risks for as short as three years," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the paper. "Used alone, the pooled cohort equation estimates the 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The addition of ECG-AI to see hidden risks sooner has the potential to save more lives. This model may also help identify people who do not know they have coronary disease who may benefit from lifesaving therapies."</p>



<p>The study was funded by Anumana, a spinoff company of nference and Mayo Clinic. Mayo Clinic has licensed this technology to Anumana. Mayo Clinic and authors of this study may benefit financially in the future if this technology is commercialized.</p>

<p>"The findings suggest that it is possible to identify a small but meaningful subset of patients with heart failure who have multiple, co-occurring social risk factors and may be at greater risk for poor health outcomes," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/savitz-samuel-sam-t-ph-d/bio-20503199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Savitz, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic health services researcher and lead author of the study.</p>



<p>Researchers used a statistical method to categorize 3,142 patients with heart failure. They all were living in an 11‐county region of southeast Minnesota and were 18 years or older with a first‐ever diagnosis of heart failure. The average age was 73.4, with 45.2% of the patients being women.</p>



<p>Researchers divided them into four groups based on living environments and other social risk factors.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Group 1</strong>&nbsp;had 1,093 patients living in urban areas with moderate social risk factors.</li>



<li><strong>Group 2</strong>&nbsp;had 531 patients living in rural areas with similar risk factors.</li>



<li><strong>Group 3</strong>&nbsp;had 185 patients and was considered moderately rural with multiple social risk factors.</li>



<li><strong>Group 4</strong>, the reference group, had 1,333 patients and consisted of mostly urban areas with higher education levels and fewer social risk challenges.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key findings</strong></h2>



<p>According to the study, patients in Group 3 — living in a moderately rural area and facing the most social risk factors — used more healthcare services than those in Group 4, who had higher education levels and more access to community resources.</p>



<p>Patients in Group 1 — living in urban areas — had better outcomes than those in the "mostly urban" Group 4, despite having more social risk factors. The researchers suggest this was likely due to better access to care within their urban community.</p>



<p>The research also revealed that approximately 18.2% of patients within the study experienced moderate social isolation, while 5.7% experienced high social isolation, indicating a lack of social connections or support.</p>



<p>"This study provides further evidence that health systems and policymakers should devote resources and develop interventions to address the effects of social risk factors on patient outcomes," says&nbsp;Dr. Savitz.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking a Patient-Centered Approach</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Savitz said the study also shows that heart failure cannot be treated in isolation but should be viewed through a broader lens of the patient’s life circumstances. Future interventions, he says, could use a patient-centered approach to address social risk factors.</p>



<p>He notes that it is crucial to evaluate whether these findings extend to other regions of the country, particularly those with greater racial and ethnic diversity.</p>

<p></p>



<p>"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" is an adage that Mayo Clinic cardiologist Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez says remains true today.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-360607 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat.jpg 1687w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"No matter how difficult prevention might look, it is way better than treating heart disease."</p><cite>Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p></p>
</div></div>



<p>And prevention, he says, can start small by focusing on the simple things, like&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-8-heart-healthy-diet-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diet</a>&nbsp;and exercise.</p>



<p>"Trying to eat healthier a little bit at a time, to move around through the day, avoiding sitting for too long," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>A positive outlook also can go far in your physical well-being. Enjoy a walk with a friend, for instance.</p>



<p>"Trying to find purpose every day, and trying to give love every day, because those are some of the emotional things that we don't take care of (that) also affect the heart," he says.</p>



<p>And finally, he says if you are prescribed medication for high&nbsp;blood pressure or high&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>, avoid the risk of a heart attack and follow your doctor's orders.</p>



<p>"Take those medications, check your numbers and be sure that all those factors are well under control," Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips and strategies for a heart-healthy diet</h3>



<ul>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (2:24) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/SCRIPT-AED-NatPkg.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"I really want people not to be afraid to use an AED because applying an AED to someone who has collapsed and doesn't have a pulse can actually save their life and save their life in a way that they won't have long-lasting consequences," says Dr. Gallo De Moraes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to use an AED</h2>



<p>If someone has fainted and might need an AED:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Check to see if the person is breathing and has a pulse.</strong></li>



<li><strong>If you cannot feel a pulse and the person is not breathing, call for emergency help.</strong> If there are other people present, one person can call 911 while the other prepares the AED. If you're alone, call 911 or emergency services first to make sure help is on the way.</li>



<li><strong>Turn on the AED.</strong> The automated external defibrillator gives you step-by-step voice instructions. It will tell you how to check for breathing and pulse and how to position electrode pads on the person's bare chest.</li>



<li><strong>Deliver the shock.</strong> When the pads are in place, the AED automatically measures the person's heart rhythm and determines if a shock is needed. If it is, the machine tells the user to stand back and push a button to deliver the shock. The AED is programmed not to deliver a shock if a shock isn't needed.</li>



<li><strong>Start CPR.</strong> Begin CPR after the shock is delivered if CPR is still needed. The AED also will guide users through CPR. The process can be repeated as needed until emergency crews take over.</li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. Gallo De Moraes says CPR is the most important thing to do after the shock of the AED is delivered.</p>



<p>"Once you start chest compressions, the AED will give you a countdown clock for two minutes, and it will remind you to stop compressions at two minutes so it can analyze again," says Dr. Gallo De Moraes.</p>



<p>She says if the audio instructions are followed, there’s no way to further hurt or injure someone by using an AED.</p>



<p>AED devices are often found in public places, such as schools, sports stadiums and airports, and are also carried by emergency medical services. AEDs should be in easily accessible and visible locations where they can quickly be retrieved in the event of a sudden cardiac arrest. Signs with the AED heart-shaped symbol should be located above where the devices are located.</p>
