<p>Hormone changes are a natural part of aging, but the experience is different for men and women. Unlike the more dramatic plunge that occurs in women during menopause, sex hormone changes in men occur gradually. This is sometimes called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/mens-health/in-depth/male-menopause/art-20048056?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">male menopause</a>.</p>



<p>For women, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a> marks the end of their menstrual cycles, whether by naturally declining reproductive hormones, surgical removal of the ovaries, changes caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or a conditional called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-ovarian-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20354683?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary ovarian insufficiency</a>. Ovulation ends and hormone production plummets during a relatively short period of time.</p>



<p>In men, production of testosterone and other hormones declines over a period of many years and the consequences aren't necessarily clear. This gradual decline of testosterone levels is called late-onset hypogonadism or age-related low testosterone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Recognizing low testosterone levels</strong></h2>



<p>A man's testosterone levels decline on average about 1% a year after 40. But most older men still have testosterone levels within the normal range, with only an estimated 10% to 25% having levels considered to be low.</p>



<p>Low testosterone levels in older men often goes unnoticed. Testosterone levels can be checked by a blood test, but tests aren't done routinely. And many men who have low testosterone levels experience no symptoms. In addition, the signs and symptoms associated with low testosterone aren't specific to low testosterone. They also can be caused by a person's age, medication use, or other conditions, such as having a body mass index of 30 or higher.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms suggestive of low testosterone include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced sexual desire and activity.</li>



<li>Decreased spontaneous erections or erectile dysfunction.</li>



<li>Breast discomfort or swelling.</li>



<li>Infertility.</li>



<li>Height loss, low trauma fracture or low bone mineral density.</li>



<li>Hot flushes or sweats.</li>
</ul>



<p>Other possible symptoms include decreased energy, motivation and confidence; depressed mood; and poor concentration. It's also possible to experience increased sleepiness; sleep disturbances; mild, unexplained anemia; reduced muscle bulk and strength; and increased body fat.</p>



<p>Experts recommend only testing older men for low testosterone if they have signs or symptoms. If an initial test shows low testosterone, the test should be repeated to confirm the results. If low testosterone is confirmed, further testing of the pituitary gland is recommended to determine the cause and rule out other hormone deficiencies. The pituitary gland is a kidney-bean-sized gland situated at the base of your brain. It is part of your body's endocrine system, which consists of all the glands that produce and regulate hormones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Recommendations on <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/sexual-health/in-depth/testosterone-therapy/art-20045728?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testosterone therapy</a> for men with age-related low testosterone vary. In 2020, the American College of Physicians recommended that healthcare professionals consider starting testosterone treatment in men with sexual dysfunction who want to improve their sexual function, after explaining the risks and benefits. In 2018, the Endocrine Society recommended testosterone therapy for men with age-related low testosterone who have signs and symptoms associated with low testosterone.</p>



<p>Some experts also recommend offering testosterone treatment to men with age-related low testosterone without the presence of signs or symptoms.</p>



<p>If you choose to start testosterone therapy, your healthcare professional will explain the different ways testosterone can be administered, target levels and follow-up testing.</p>



<p>For some men, testosterone therapy relieves bothersome signs and symptoms of testosterone deficiency. For others, the benefits aren't clear, and there are possible risks.</p>



<p>Though further research is needed, testosterone therapy might stimulate growth of metastatic prostate and breast cancer. Testosterone therapy also may increase the risk of heart attack and stroke and contribute to the formation of blood clots in the veins.</p>



<p>Your healthcare team likely will recommend against starting testosterone therapy if your fertility is important in the near future or if you have conditions such as breast or prostate cancer, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, uncontrolled heart failure, or thrombophilia, or if you've recently had a heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>If you think you might have low testosterone, talk to your healthcare team about your signs and symptoms, testing, and possible treatment options. They can help you weigh the pros and cons of treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (:56) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Script-MCM-Salmonella.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Salmonella is a bacterial infection that affects the intestinal tract.</p>



<p>"Salmonella is contracted through poorly cooked foods — such as meat, poultry, eggs, milk — poor water conditions or poor sanitation," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>The infection also can be spread through human and animal feces.</p>



<p>"Salmonella may cause an intestinal infection, such as having diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, and, in some cases, fever," he says.</p>



<p>The good news is that, generally, cases will resolve on their own within a few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"In some cases, with severe illness, where it's unrelenting beyond a few days, seeking prompt medical attention is very important," says Dr. Bracamonte.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how can you protect yourself?</p>



<p>Be careful when preparing food, especially raw meat and poultry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevent cross-contamination of foods, and most importantly, wash your hands.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Causes of salmonella infection</h3>



<p>People can become ill from infection from a variety of sources. Commonly infected foods include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Raw meat, poultry and seafood</strong><br>Feces may get onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process. Seafood may be contaminated if harvested from contaminated water.</li>



<li><strong>Raw eggs</strong><br>While an egg's shell may seem to be a perfect barrier to contamination, some infected chickens produce eggs that contain salmonella before the shell is even formed. Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.</li>



<li><strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong><br>Some fresh produce, particularly imported varieties, may be hydrated in the field or washed during processing with water contaminated with salmonella. Contamination also can occur in the kitchen when juices from raw meat and poultry come into contact with uncooked foods, such as salads.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some pet foods, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/kiambu-11-23/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dry dog food</a>, may be contaminated with salmonella and can infect animals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Bracamonte says salmonella also is harbored in some animals,&nbsp;such as reptileacs and birds. So if you have those pets, it's important that you wash your hands appropriately after handling them.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve heard "a calorie is a calorie" when it comes to weight loss, but can that really be true? With the number of diets out there (keto, intermittent fasting, Mediterranean), I'm completely overwhelmed with what I'm meant to be doing.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Yes and no. (Isn't that always the answer to nutrition inquiries?) While a calorie <em>may</em> be a calorie when it comes to the mathematical equation of weight loss, there's more to it. Calories are a unit of energy. The total calories a food or beverage provides depend on the number of grams of carbohydrates, protein, fat and/or alcohol contained. The number of calories, though, does not predict how we'll feel afterward.</p>



<p>For example, a 200-calorie snack of an apple with peanut butter is going to help you feel fuller and more satisfied than a 200-calorie snack of chips. The difference is in not only the food composition but food volume as well. The apple and peanut butter snack will provide fiber, fat, water and some protein. The majority of these attributes are lacking when it comes to the chips.</p>



<p>Think volume too — the apple snack will stretch the stomach more due to its larger size, sending that fullness signal to the brain. The 200 calories worth of chips also are going to be digested and leave the stomach faster than the apple because there's not much breakdown that needs to happen.</p>



<p>We also can't talk about this topic without referencing health outcomes. It is well known that the composition of one's diet, or dietary pattern, is significant. A plant-based diet containing whole grains, fruits, vegetables, unsaturated fats and lean proteins provides the body with balanced nutrition that can decrease the risk of chronic conditions.</p>



<p>There are multiple ways to do this healthfully. Diet styles such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mediterranean</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">DASH</a> and the <a href="https://diet.mayoclinic.org/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Diet</a> are examples of eating patterns that focus on high nutrient density and have been shown to promote positive health outcomes. This also can be done through a well-planned <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegetarian diet</a>. It's important to take both your food preferences and health concerns or goals into account.</p>



<p>So what about weight loss? Here's where calories are crucial. For example, even a Mediterranean diet does not guarantee weight loss if a calorie deficit is not present. Olive oil and nuts are excellent sources of healthy fat, but when eaten without one's total calorie intake in mind, it could, technically, cause weight gain. Using the style of eating that is best for you, consider working toward a 250-750 calorie per day deficit. This may be swapping your mid-afternoon snack for a piece of fruit or skipping your usual sweetened coffee or alcoholic beverage.</p>



<p>The body needs to burn more than it's consuming to produce weight loss. While exercise is always going to be recommended, it's important to remember that exercise alone is not likely to get most people into that roughly 500-calorie deficit. The majority of us will be most successful with weight loss through dietary changes.</p>



<p>Most diets work because adapting your baseline eating habits to fit a specific diet's protocol will likely cause you to eat fewer calories. Good news, right? Possibly. This is only going to benefit someone who can stay on said diet long term. Diets that endorse or require drastic and unrealistic changes (such as the cabbage soup diet) aren't sustainable. And when a diet is not sustainable, the weight loss won't be either.</p>



<p>So, start here:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose a healthful diet that fits your personal eating and health preferences.</li>



<li>Work toward a gradual calorie deficit, ideally limiting excess (more than you need) and empty (non-nutrition-providing) calories.</li>



<li>Remember that a slow, steady and sustainable approach is most likely to help you achieve a healthy weight. <span style="color: #000000"><em>—</em></span> <em><strong>Tara Schmidt, Registered Dietitian, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</strong></em></li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Two common types of inflammatory bowel disease</h3>



<p>IBD is a broad term for chronic inflammation of your digestive tract. Two types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</p>



<p>“Ulcerative colitis really tends to only involve the colon and be more of a superficial type inflammation; whereas Crohn's disease can impact anything in the intestine, essentially, from the mouth all the way down to the anus," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<p>She says diet alone does not cause IBD. While some foods may reduce symptoms, there is no one proven diet to control inflammation.</p>



<p>"The right diet is probably different for each individual, based on the type of IBD that they have, the location of their disease, whether they've had surgeries or other complications," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Young Hispanic or Latina woman cuts vegetables, bowl of fruit" class="wp-image-373059" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1.jpg 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Diet recommendations for inflammatory bowel disease depend on the indivdual. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid ultraprocessed foods, added sugars and animal fats. And drink plenty of fluid to stay hydrated.</p>



<p>Diet does not replace medical treatment. Dr. Johnson says there are effective <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20353325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> options, so it is important to work with your healthcare provider.</p>



<p>"The tenant of therapy we have are immune-suppressing-type therapies that try to target that inappropriate response to the intestines and then calm down that inflammation within the gut," she says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>I'm pregnant with my second child. During the 20-week anatomy scan, my obstetrician detected my baby has a cleft lip. Does this mean my baby also has a cleft palate? How and when is a cleft lip or cleft palate corrected?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cleft-palate/symptoms-causes/syc-20370985?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleft lip and cleft palate</a> are openings or splits in the upper lip, the roof of the mouth — called the palate — or both. Cleft lip and cleft palate occur when the facial structures that are developing in an unborn baby don't close completely. While a cleft lip can form independently, it's more commonly found in combination with a cleft palate.</p>



<p>These are among the most common birth defects. Typically, cleft lip and palate happen in isolation, but occasionally, it is part of a genetic syndrome that includes cleft lip or cleft palate as one of its signs. Cleft lip and palate also can be associated with heart conditions, which often can be screened for and identified prenatally. It is important to be assessed by a genetic counselor to rule out any inherited diseases.</p>



<p>Generally, a cleft lip is repaired around the time when a child is 10 to 12 weeks old to ensure your child has established their feeding pattern and shows good weight gain. To close the separation in your child's lip, the surgeon makes incisions on both sides of the cleft and creates flaps of tissue. The flaps and lip muscles are then stitched together. This approach improves the lip's appearance, structure and function.</p>



<p>For a cleft palate, the repair is usually planned when the child is between 10 and 12 months old. The wait from birth to surgery for a cleft palate is longer because it allows more time for the mouth to grow. To close and rebuild the roof of the mouth requires access to a small space in the littlest of patients.</p>



<p>Children diagnosed with cleft palate are monitored closely for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20351616?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ear infections</a>. A cleft palate can affect the function of the eustachian tube, a small tube connecting your middle ear down to your throat. The muscles of your palate help open and close your eustachian tubes. Babies are assessed for the development of chronic fluid in the middle ear and a hearing test is performed to assess your child's ability to hear. Ear tubes may be placed at the time of the cleft lip surgery or, if present, at the time of the cleft palate surgery. Sometimes ear tubes can be placed in an office setting under no anesthesia.</p>



<p>In preparation for their cleft lip or palate repair surgery, your child may be a candidate for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ask-the-mayo-mom-healing-from-cleft-lip-and-cleft-palate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nasoalveolar molding</a>, a nonsurgical option that helps reduce the gap in the upper lip and cleft on the roof of the mouth. It also can reshape your child's nostrils. Surgery is performed after the molding is complete at around 3 to 4 months. Nasoalveolar molding can significantly improve your child's outcomes and reduce their need for additional corrective operations as they grow.</p>



<p>Having a baby born with a cleft lip or palate can be concerning, but these conditions can be corrected. Advancements in operations result in better outcomes for your child by improving function and reducing scarring. However, it is important to seek treatment from centers such as Mayo Clinic, which specializes in treating cleft lip and palate.</p>



<p>Mayo's team at the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cleft-craniofacial-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20511135?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleft and Craniofacial Clinic in Minnesota</a> employs a multispecialty approach to address each patient's individualized needs. Directed by plastic surgeons, the team may include specialists in ear, nose and throat (ENT), oral surgery, orthodontics, lactation, speech, hearing, psychology, genetics, social services and others. Together, this team treats hundreds of children each year who have cleft lip and palate. <em><span style="color: #000000">— </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mardini-samir-m-d/bio-20054870?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dr. Samir Mardini</strong></a><strong>, Plastic Surgery and </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/gibreel-waleed-m-b-b-s/bio-20505921?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dr. Waleed Gibreel</strong></a><strong>, Plastic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</strong></em></p>

<p>"The décor, the gifts and the fun outdoor activities can be a lot of fun for families, especially children," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/peter-reisner-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Reisner, M.D.</a>, a family medicine physician at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/chetek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Chetek, Wisconsin</a>. "But parents should be aware of the hidden dangers they may not be thinking about when putting up the Christmas tree or heading out for an afternoon of sledding."</p>



<p>Dr. Reisner recommends these safety tips while preparing for the holidays:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Manage your Christmas tree.</strong></h2>



<p>If you have a real tree, ensure the tree stand is always filled with water so the tree doesn't dry out and pose an increased fire hazard. If you buy an artificial tree, make sure it is made from fire-retardant material. Make sure the stand is flat on the ground and decorate the tree to equally distribute weight.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Keep flames away.</strong></h2>



<p>Don't leave children alone in a room with lighted candles, matches, lighters, fireplaces, or any other sources of flame or heat.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Watch for tempting seasonal decor.</strong></h2>



<p>Keep decorations out of reach of children and secured to the wall. Any object small enough to fit through a toilet paper tube can obstruct a child's airway. Closely supervise children if they're helping you decorate, especially when handling lighting, ornaments and breakable objects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Keep plants out of little hands.</strong></h2>



<p>Keep mistletoe, holly berries and poinsettias out of reach of children, as each is toxic when ingested.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Remember electricity safety.</strong></h2>



<p>Use power strips with built-in circuit breakers. Avoid putting too many plugs into one electrical outlet. Keep cords out of the way or behind furniture, and insert electrical outlet covers into unused outlets. Purchase lights with the UL Listed mark, which certifies that the product has been tested to meet safety requirements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Find safe toys.</strong></h2>



<p>Make sure your children's toys are age-appropriate and the batteries cannot be easily removed. Batteries shaped like disks, or button batteries, pose a choking risk to young children. Avoid placing gifts under the tree that contain glass, perfume or cologne, poisonous substances or sharp materials.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Monitor alcohol in the home.</strong></h2>



<p>Keep alcohol out of reach of children. Quickly clean up leftover drinks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Bundle up and use safety gear.</strong></h2>



<p>Dress children properly for the weather, making sure that their hands, feet and heads are covered. Supervise children and make sure they wear the correct safety gear for sledding, skiing, snowboarding, ice skating and other outdoor activities.</p>



<p>"Carefully inspecting your home and taking care of any safety hazards can ensure you and your children have a happy and safe holiday season," says Dr. Reisner.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Whole grains are an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/whole-grains/art-20047826?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">important part of healthy diet</a>. They are good sources of complex carbohydrates, as well as some key vitamins and minerals. And because whole grains are naturally high in fiber, they may help you feel full and satisfied, which can make it easier to maintain a healthy body weight. Eating more whole-grain foods also can <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/expert-answers/whole-grain-foods/faq-20058417?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lower your blood pressure</a>.</p>



<p>Some people, though, have a medical diagnosis that means they must avoid the gluten in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celiac disease</a>, also called celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immune reaction to eating gluten. While the cause of celiac disease isn't known, the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-more-people-are-developing-celiac-disease/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disease is becoming more common</a>.</p>



<p>If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents it from absorbing some nutrients. The intestinal damage often causes diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating and anemia. And it can lead to serious complications.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/gluten-free-diet/art-20048530?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gluten-free diet</a> is essential to manage signs and symptoms of celiac disease and other medical conditions associated with gluten, including nonceliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wheat-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20378897?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wheat allergy</a>.</p>



<p>Following a gluten-free diet requires paying careful attention to food selections, the ingredients found in foods and their nutritional content, as well as medications.</p>



<p>Removing wheat, barley and rye from your diet may seem daunting. Trace amounts of gluten in your diet can be damaging, even if they don't cause signs or symptoms. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352225?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gluten can be hidden</a> in foods and nonfood products, including medications, vitamin and mineral supplements, toothpaste and mouthwash. A dietitian can help you plan a healthy, gluten-free diet. </p>



<p>And you can still enjoy the health benefits of eating whole grains. Options in a gluten-free diet include buckwheat, corn, flax, millet, quinoa and rice. While oats are naturally gluten-free, they may be contaminated during production with wheat, barley or rye. Oats and oat products labeled as gluten-free have not been cross-contaminated. However, some people with celiac disease cannot tolerate the oats labeled as gluten-free.</p>

<p>In 2017, Cindy Sutherland caught a nasty cold she couldn't shake. After coughing nonstop for weeks, she went to urgent care and got a chest X-ray. When the doctor shared the results with her, he asked, "Have you ever heard of pulmonary fibrosis?" Cindy started to cry because she knew what those words meant. Her grandmother had died of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary fibrosis</a> at the age of 62. Her mother had died of it at 58, and her sister at 48.</p>

<p>The progressive lung disease can be traced to a variety of causes — autoimmune conditions, radiation treatments, specific medications or chemotherapeutic agents, toxins like asbestos or coal dust and environmental factors like mold. Recently, researchers have begun to recognize that a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33935155/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subset of cases can be attributed to genetics</a>. Some patients with pulmonary fibrosis have shortened telomeres, the caps on the ends of chromosomes that protect cells from aging. Identifying these patients is critical because, in their case, certain treatments like immunosuppressive therapies could be dangerous.</p>

<p>"I think it is way more frequent than we realize," says Sutherland’s pulmonologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/carmona-porquera-eva-m-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eva Carmona Porquera, M.D., Ph.D.</a> She is part of a large, multidisciplinary team at Mayo Clinic developing new ways to detect and treat pulmonary fibrosis cases caused by shortened telomeres.</p>



<p>"This is new territory," says Dr. Carmona Porquera. "The good thing is that at Mayo, we can offer genetic testing and telomere testing to our patients to classify, treat and prepare for complications associated with telomere biology disorders."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A rare and complex disorder</strong></h2>



<p>Telomere biology disorders are rare diseases caused by mutations that accelerate telomere shortening. Patients with these disorders are susceptible to a variety of age-related conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, bone marrow failure, osteoporosis, cancer and liver fibrosis. Many but not all patients show outward signs of premature aging, such as premature graying of hair or brittle nails. </p>

<p>Hematologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/patnaik-mrinal-s-m-b-b-s/bio-00093620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mrinal Patnaik, M.B.B.S</a>., first encountered these disorders as a medical resident in the early 2000s. A patient in his thirties with completely gray hair had shown up with a malignant tumor at the head and neck cancer clinic where Dr. Patnaik was training. Doctors there did not realize he had a telomere biology disorder. The patient died a month later from complete bone marrow failure.</p>



<p>"That really hurt me deep down," says Dr. Patnaik. "I felt that there's so many of these patients who are going to be coming into different clinics and if I didn't step up and set up a program for them and educate all my colleagues and set up the infrastructure, we're going to see a lot more patients suffer."&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the help of the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, Dr. Patnaik established the Telomere Biology Disorders Clinic at the Rochester, Minnesota, campus in 2017. The clinic is multidisciplinary in nature, drawing expertise from hematologists, oncologists, pulmonologists, liver specialists, pharmacists, molecular biologists and genetic counselors. To date, the clinic has seen more than 100 patients with shortened telomeres.</p>



<p>"We are among the largest adult telomere biology disorder clinics in the country," says Dr. Patnaik, who plans to open similar clinics in Arizona and Florida.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No perfect way</strong></h2>



<p>The most frequent manifestation of a telomere biology disorder is pulmonary fibrosis, the scarring of lung tissue that can make it difficult to breathe. As telomeres become shorter and shorter, the chromosomes they are designed to protect can unravel and fray, like a shoelace that has lost its protective cap. Eventually, the telomeres become so short that cells stop dividing — a process known as senescence. Those senescent cells send off a slew of chemicals that act as flares, triggering inflammatory changes that damage and thicken the lungs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers hope that by diagnosing and treating the disease earlier, they can improve outcomes for patients.</p>

<p>Telomere biology disorders are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29976374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typically diagnosed</a> by looking for shortened telomeres and testing for genetic mutations. "There are different techniques that have been developed over time to measure telomere length, and each one has pros and cons," says molecular biologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ferrer-alejandro-ph-d/bio-20503546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.</a> "Basically, there's no perfect way to do this."</p>



<p>One of the most common methods for measuring telomeres involves a technique known as Flow FISH, in which each telomere is labeled with a fluorescent marker and then fed into a machine that quantifies the average amount of fluorescence across all the telomeres on all the chromosomes in the cell. Other techniques involve sequencing to count the repetitive run of bases, TTAGGG, that makes up each telomere, again averaging the result.</p>



<p>"However, it's well-known in the field that it's not that all telomeres get shorter at the same time; it can be just one or two telomeres falling below a certain threshold that can cause disease," says Dr. Ferrer. "If you rely on a technique that uses the average, you could miss those cases."</p>



<p>Dr. Ferrer and collaborators within and outside Mayo Clinic devised a specialized sequencing technique called Telogator to assess the shortest telomere length of each chromosome.</p>



<p>"This test could have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value," says Dr. Patnaik.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Answers, finally</strong></h2>



<p>Even with the limitations of the current tests, the Telomere Biology Clinic is making a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=29804726&amp;query_hl=11&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive impact</a> on patients. Sutherland first visited the clinic in 2020 and learned that, on average, her telomere lengths fell below the first percentile. "Dr. Patnaik said they were the shortest telomeres he had ever seen," she recalls. Genetic testing revealed Sutherland had a mutation in the TERT gene, which codes for a protein called telomerase that is responsible for telomere maintenance.</p>



<p>The Mayo team estimates that they have identified a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33203829/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disease-causing variant in a telomere-associated gene</a> in only 40% of patients. In many cases, they have discovered genetic changes that may or may not cause disease — called variants of unknown significance — and have conducted functional studies in the laboratory to categorize the effect of those variants.</p>



<p>Sutherland says she felt relieved when she learned she had a genetic mutation. "You're always looking for a reason, a cause, an explanation for why this happened. Why did my grandmother, my mother and my sister pass of this horrible disease at such a young age?"</p>



<p>But that sense of relief was quickly replaced by one of foreboding for the mother of five. "I was absolutely, positively scared to death for my children."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Telomere biology disorders are subject to a troubling type of genetic inheritance known as genetic anticipation. The disorder tends to become more severe and appear at an earlier age as the mutation — and the shortened telomeres — are passed from one generation to the next. As a result, Sutherland worried not only that she had passed the condition on to her children, but also that they might inherit a form of the disease much worse than what she herself has experienced.</p>



<p>"These findings have repercussions for family members," says Dr. Carmona Porquera. "We can counsel patients: no smoking, no exposures that can cause more injury, be aware of certain symptoms. And we can start treating them earlier with anti-fibrotic drugs, which could slow the progression of the disease."</p>



<p>Sutherland has been taking anti-fibrotic drugs for the last six years. Though she often feels short of breath, at age 65, she still has the energy to babysit her grandchildren.</p>



<p>Recently, genetic testing revealed no inherited mutations in her family tree.</p>



<p>"Maybe this horrible disease will stop with me," she says. "That would be my greatest wish."</p>

<p>It's flu season again, so most people&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/dont-skip-your-flu-shot-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get a flu shot</a>&nbsp;and strive to stay healthy. But can certain foods or supplements boost the immune system and help with that "staying healthy" goal?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep the immune system strong</h2>



<p>While having a healthy immune system is a plus during the season of colds and flu, consider these tips for keeping your immune system strong throughout the year.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on a balanced eating plan.</h4>



<p>Don't skip meals, so your body stays well-fueled. Aim for five to nine servings of vegetables and fruits daily to provide those immune-boosting vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. A serving of fruit is one medium piece of fresh fruit, 1 cup of berries or melon, or 1/2 cup of canned fruit packed in its own juice. A serving of vegetables is 1/2 cup cooked or 1 cup raw. Getting these nutrients from foods versus vitamin or mineral supplements is always best. Many herbal remedies are marketed to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/7-ways-to-combat-coughs-and-colds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fight colds</a>&nbsp;or shorten their duration, but check with a health care professional before taking any supplements or medications. And don't forget fluids. Remember to drink adequate fluids throughout the day. Plain water is best.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Crack down on spreading germs.</h4>



<p>Good hygiene and hand-washing help prevent the spread of germs. Remember to wash produce before eating or using it in recipes. Clean glasses, forks, spoons and other utensils to reduce the spread and growth of bacteria.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Increase sleep, reduce stress.</h4>



<p>Getting adequate sleep and managing stress can be just as important as healthy eating to prevent the flu.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Research demonstrates that lack of sleep and increased stress contribute to illness and overall poor health, so:</h5>



<ul>
<li>Adults should get seven to nine hours of sleep each day, while children need eight to 14 hours, depending on age.</li>



<li>Healthy ways to cope with stress include meditating, listening to music or journaling.</li>



<li>Physical activity is another strategy to manage stress and may reduce the risk of some chronic diseases that can weaken your immune system.</li>
</ul>



<p>Even if you eat healthily, get plenty of rest, drink adequate fluids and manage your stress, you may still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/facts-about-flu">catch the flu</a>. If so, your illness may not last as long, and you may not feel so bad.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some myths and facts about immune-boosting nutrients:</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fact: Chicken soup can help you feel better.</h3>



<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, there are many healing benefits of chicken soup. Your favorite recipe likely has properties that fight inflammation, promote hydration and get mucus flowing. Drink plenty of liquids, such as water, broth or sports drinks with electrolytes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Vitamin C can prevent illness.</h3>



<p>When taken before cold symptoms start, vitamin C may shorten the duration, but it doesn't keep you from getting sick.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Dairy increases mucus production.</h3>



<p>You may have heard that milk and other dairy products worsen congestion during an illness. Research has not proven this to be true.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choose immune-boosting nutrients</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">These nutrients play a role in immune health:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Beta carotene</strong><br>Beta carotene is found in plant foods, such as sweet potatoes, spinach, carrots, mangoes, broccoli and tomatoes.</li>



<li><strong>Vitamin C</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/add-citrus-colors-and-flavors-to-meals">Vitamin C-rich foods</a>&nbsp;include citrus fruits, berries, melons, tomatoes, bell peppers and broccoli.</li>



<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong><br>Vitamin D is found in fatty fish and eggs. Milk and 100% juices fortified with vitamin D also are good sources.</li>



<li><strong>Zinc</strong><br>Zinc tends to be better absorbed from foods such as beef and seafood, but it's also found in plant-based sources, including wheat germ, beans, nuts and tofu.</li>



<li><strong>Probiotics</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-deal-with-probiotics">Probiotics</a>&nbsp;are good bacteria that promote health. You'll find them in cultured dairy products, such as yogurt, and in fermented foods, such as kefir and kimchi.</li>



<li><strong>Protein</strong><br>Protein comes from animal and plant sources, including milk, yogurt, eggs, beef, chicken, seafood, nuts, seeds, beans and lentils.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stay well. In the meantime, here are some recipes incorporating immune-fighting foods:</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Chicken noodle soup with dill</h4>



<p>Serves 6</p>



<p>10 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth<br>3 medium carrots, diced<br>1 large stalk celery, diced<br>3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger<br>6 cloves garlic, minced<br>4 ounces whole-wheat egg noodles (3 cups)<br>4 cups shredded cooked skinless chicken breast (about 1 pound)<br>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill<br>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>I've been hearing a lot about mindfulness meditation lately and how it can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. But I'm a bit skeptical and don't really understand how sitting still and doing nothing can make such a big difference. I have a busy and active lifestyle, and the idea of spending time just focusing on my breath or thoughts sounds boring. Are there real benefits of mindfulness meditation and how it can realistically fit into a fast-paced life like mine?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: It's common to feel skeptical about an activity that promises quick and easy stress relief. Yet, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/use-mindfulness-to-improve-well-being?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">mindfulness</a> meditation promises just that. It's a fast and easy way to reduce stress wherever you are.</p>



<p>Mindfulness meditation is the practice of purposefully being aware of and focusing your attention on the present moment. Mindfulness allows you to be in tune with your experience — right now in this moment — and to explore with curiosity whatever sensations, thoughts and emotions are present without expectations or judgment.</p>



<p>During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This focus can result in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.</p>



<p>Many people may think of mindfulness <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/about/pac-20385120?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">meditation</a> as "sitting on a pillow, being still, with eyes closed." This may work for some, but there are many ways to practice mindfulness meditation.</p>



<p>Practicing mindfulness involves using breathing methods, guided imagery, and other strategies to relax the body and mind to help reduce stress.</p>



<p>To try focused breathing meditation, sit down, take a deep breath and close your eyes. Focus on your breath as it moves in and out of your body. Sitting and breathing slowly for even just a minute can help.</p>



<p>As you start meditating, try these structured mindfulness exercises:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Body scan meditation</strong><br>Lie on your back with your legs extended and arms at your sides, palms facing up. Focus your attention slowly and deliberately on each part of your body, in order, from toe to head or head to toe. Be aware of any sensations, emotions or thoughts associated with each part of your body.</li>



<li><strong>Sitting meditation</strong><br>Sit comfortably with your back straight, feet flat on the floor and hands in your lap. Breathing through your nose, focus on your breath moving in and out of your body. If physical sensations or thoughts interrupt your meditation, note the experience and then return your focus to your breathing.</li>



<li><strong>Walking meditation</strong><br>Find a quiet place 10- to 20-feet long and walk slowly. Focus on the experience of walking, being aware of the sensations of standing and the subtle movements that keep your balance. When you reach the end of your path, turn and continue walking, maintaining awareness of your sensations.</li>
</ul>



<p>Often, mindfulness meditation is recommended as part of a comprehensive treatment for physical and mental health conditions. It's considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. You can incorporate mindfulness meditation into your busy routine to improve your overall health.</p>



<p>There are many benefits of mindfulness meditation engaging the brain. Think of it as a form of brain exercise. Just as physical exercise keeps your body healthy, mindfulness meditation keeps your <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-tips-to-keep-your-brain-healthy?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">brain fit</a>. Research has shown that just five to 15 minutes of daily meditation is all you need to begin experiencing benefits.</p>



<p>After decades of research into the practice, these benefits have been found to include an increase in:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cognitive flexibility</li>



<li>Diabetes control</li>



<li>Emotion regulation</li>



<li>Empathy</li>



<li>Focus and attention</li>



<li>Immune system response</li>



<li>Memory</li>



<li>Positive emotions</li>



<li>Positive relationships</li>



<li>Relaxation</li>



<li>Self-compassion</li>



<li>Self-esteem</li>
</ul>



<p>The practice also affects many negative physical and mental symptoms, including decreases in:</p>



<ul>
<li>Addictive behaviors</li>



<li>Anger and hostility</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20360803?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Anxiety</a></li>

<li>Stress</li>
</ul>



<p>Mindfulness is a supportive strategy to help manage many health issues. It pairs well with other medical treatments and counseling. It's a simple strategy that doesn't require a prescription or special equipment and can be practiced anywhere. Talk with your healthcare team about incorporating mindfulness meditation into your life and see if it makes a difference in your health and general sense of well-being. — <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/joel-bobby-licsw"><em>Joel Bobby</em></a></strong><strong><em>, licensed independent clinical social worker, Psychiatry &amp; Psychology, Mayo Clinic Health System,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/austin"><em>Austin, Minnesota</em></a></strong></p>
