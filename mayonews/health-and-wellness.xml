<p>With all the rain of late, many people may be wondering if it's safe to embrace the weather and indulge in activities like playing or exercising in the rain.</p>



<p>"So, rain itself does not make you sick," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/tanner-dunn-cnp-dnp-apnp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanner Dunn, D.N.P</a>., a family nurse practitioner at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/holmen/services-and-treatments/family-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Holmen</a>, Wisconsin. "However, the effects that rain can have on your body can make you more susceptible to illness."</p>



<p>While getting caught in the rain doesn't directly cause illness, it can lead to a decreased body temperature. This drop in temperature can create an environment where certain bacteria thrive and can weaken your immune system, potentially leading to coldlike symptoms.</p>



<p>Addressing concerns for individuals with immune system issues, Dunn notes that colds are caused by viruses, not by getting wet.</p>



<p>"If you're out in the rain for long periods, especially in very cold conditions, it might affect you. But running errands in the rain here and there doesn't significantly increase your risk," says Dunn.</p>



<p>Regarding hypothermia, Dunn explains, "This time of year, we don't typically see much <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypothermia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypothermia</a> because temperatures are generally warmer. However, in colder months, both the outside temperature and the water temperature can increase the risk of hypothermia."</p>



<p>For those who need to be outside in the rain, Dunn recommends several practical tips:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dress in layers</strong>. Use water-repellent outer layers and waterproof footwear to stay dry.</li>



<li><strong>Dry off promptly</strong>. After being in the rain, dry off thoroughly and take a warm shower to help stabilize your body temperature and prevent illness.</li>



<li><strong>Flood safety</strong>. Avoid floodwaters, which can be contaminated and pose hidden hazards. "With the expected heavy rainfall, avoid driving through flooded areas and ensure you're not consuming contaminated water," Dunn advises.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite the potential risks, there are positive aspects to being out in the rain.</p>



<p>"Many people find the sound of rain very therapeutic," says Dunn. "Additionally, exercising in the rain can be beneficial. The rain helps keep you cooler, allowing you to work out longer and more effectively."</p>



<p>Walking in the rain also has respiratory benefits. Rain washes away pollutants and allergens, leaving the air cleaner and potentially improving respiratory health.</p>



<p>"The sound of rain can act as a natural stress reliever, promoting relaxation and improving sleep quality," shares Dunn. "The steady sound of raindrops can provide a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life."</p>

<p><em><strong>Editors note</strong>: June is National Aphasia Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>Imagine being dropped off in a country where you aren't fluent in the local language Even when the native speakers speak slowly, you may understand only portions of what's being said. This is similar to how someone with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aphasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369518" target="_blank">aphasia</a>&nbsp;may feel every day.</p>



<p>Aphasia is an <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/aphasia-putting-the-disorder-into-words" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impairment of language</a> that may affect ability a person's ability to speak, understand spoken language, read, write, use numbers, perform calculations or use nonverbal gestures. It happens after an injury to the brain, most commonly a stroke. However, it also can be caused by a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor or other incident affecting the brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the symptoms of aphasia?</h2>



<p>Aphasia symptoms can range from mild to severe, with each person experiencing their own set of communication weaknesses. Mild forms of aphasia may include only occasional difficulties finding words. But those with severe aphasia can suffer a complete loss of ability to speak or understand spoken and written words.</p>



<p>One of the most common questions about aphasia is, "When will this be better?" Research suggests that most recovery happens during the first four to six months following the injury. However, improvements in communication can continue for years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can you treat aphasia?</h2>



<p>A speech-language pathologist, or SLP, trained in treating aphasia and related disorders can help with recovery. According to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.asha.org/" target="_blank">American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA)</a>, clinical evidence declaring shows that people who receive services from qualified SLPs benefit in quality and quantity of their language recovery.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/speech-language-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Therapy</a> may focus on regaining abilities, strategies to compensate for communication loss or a combination of both. Either way, the main goal of <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/neurology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> is to improve the quality and efficiency of communication.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10 tips for communication success</h2>



<p>An aphasia diagnosis affects not only the person, but also their family and friends. When communicating with a loved one who has aphasia, setting them up for success is essential.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are 10 tips for improving communication with someone who has aphasia:</h3>



<ol>
<li>Continue to treat the person with aphasia as a mature adult.</li>



<li>Reduce background noises, such as the radio, TV and other conversations.</li>



<li>Reduce visual distractions, including the TV and people moving around the area.</li>



<li>Be sure you have the person's attention before speaking to them.</li>



<li>Keep messages short and simple. Speak slowly but naturally. Speaking louder doesn't increase understanding.</li>



<li>Use gestures, facial cues and voice intonation to help the person understand the message, even if they don't understand the words.</li>



<li>Don't assume they understand what you're saying. Your loved one may respond with head nods and sounds of agreement but still not understand what's being said.</li>



<li>Encourage communication and be patient.</li>



<li>Give your loved one plenty of time to respond, and try not to answer for them.</li>



<li>Include the person when they're present. Don't talk about them as if they aren't there. Just as you shouldn't assume comprehension, don't assume lack of comprehension.</li>
</ol>



<p>Recovering speech and language after an aphasia diagnosis can take time and practice, so give your loved one support, and remain calm and focused on <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire/services-and-treatments/neurology/aphasia-camp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improving communication together</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="421" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Achilles-Tendinitis16x9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389465" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Achilles-Tendinitis16x9.jpg 750w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Achilles-Tendinitis16x9-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p>LA CROSSE, Wis. ― The warm summer weather can make adults feel like kids again. The Weekend Warrior comes roaring out, and the excitement and bursts of exertion can lead to a very common injury among that group: Achilles tendinitis.</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/achilles-tendinitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Achilles tendinitis</a> is most common in people who suddenly increase the intensity or duration of exercise. It's also common when someone hasn't been properly trained for their sport," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jacob-erickson-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Erickson, D.O., Sports Medicine</a>, Mayo Clinic Health System.</p>



<p>The Achilles tendon is a long band of tissue that connects calf muscles at the back of the lower leg to your heel bone. This tendon is used when walking, running, jumping or pushing up on your toes. But if it's injured, the pain, typically located in the back of your calf, and lack of function can throw you off your stride for months.</p>



<p>Recognizing when you're at risk for Achilles tendinitis and knowing how to prevent it can keep you walking, running and exercising without pain. Risk factors include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Your sex</strong><br>Achilles tendinitis is most common in men.</li>



<li><strong>Age</strong><br>You're at a higher risk as you get older.</li>



<li><strong>Flat feet</strong><br>A naturally flat arch in your foot can put more strain on the Achilles tendon.</li>



<li><strong>Obesity</strong><br>Carrying extra pounds also increases tendon strain.</li>



<li><strong>Poor footwear</strong><br>Running in worn-out shoes or wearing footwear inappropriate for your sport can injure the tendon.</li>



<li><strong>Weather and terrain</strong><br>Tendon pain occurs more frequently in cold weather than when it's warm out. Running on hills also can put more stress on your Achilles tendon.</li>



<li><strong>Medical conditions and medications</strong><br>People with psoriasis, high blood pressure or who take certain types of antibiotics, called fluoroquinolones, are at higher risk of developing Achilles tendinitis.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Although you may be at risk for this type of injury, there are things you can do to help prevent it," says Dr. Erickson. "For example, if you're beginning an exercise regimen, start slowly and gradually increase the duration and intensity of the training."</p>



<p>Other tips include avoiding activities that place excessive stress on your tendons, such as hill running. If you participate in a strenuous activity, warm up first by exercising at a slower pace. If you notice pain during a particular exercise, stop and rest.</p>



<p>Choose your shoes carefully. The shoes you wear while exercising should provide adequate heel cushioning and firm arch support to help reduce the tension in the Achilles tendon. Replace your worn-out shoes. If your shoes are in good condition but don't support your arch, try adding supports in both shoes.</p>



<p>Take the time to stretch your calf muscles and Achilles tendon in the morning, before exercise and after exercise to maintain flexibility. This is especially important to avoid a recurrence of Achilles tendinitis.</p>



<p>Strengthen your calf muscles. Strong calf muscles enable the calf and Achilles tendon to handle activity and exercise stress better.</p>



<p>"If you do experience an Achilles injury, be sure to rest and avoid exercising the area," says Dr. Erickson. "Recognizing the pain early and avoiding exercising through the pain is key. Ignoring the pain and continuing to exercise can cause the problem to snowball and become chronic. Early recognition, resting and basic stretching can remedy the problem quickly."</p>



<p>If you are unable to get the problem to calm down after a few weeks, it is time to contact your healthcare team. Early medical treatment includes more intensive physical therapy exercises and sometimes topical treatment to assist with the pain.</p>



<p>Achilles tendinitis can become chronic and last for many months or even years if not appropriately treated early. Refractory cases of Achilles tendon pain may require surgery to repair the tendon. Healing can take months, so it's best to be aware of your risks and practice preventive strategies to keep you active and pain-free.</p>

<p>LA CROSSE, Wis. ― With summer temperatures soaring, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/healthy-pregnancy/hlv-20049471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pregnant women</a> need to be extra cautious to avoid heat-related health issues. The body's natural cooling mechanisms are already working overtime during pregnancy, making it more difficult to regulate temperature.</p>



<p><strong>The challenge of staying cool during pregnancy</strong></p>



<p>"Pregnancy makes it more difficult to keep our body temperature down," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/abbey-rose-cnm-apnp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abbey Rose</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/tomah/services-and-treatments/obstetrics-and-gynecology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certified nurse midwife</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Tomah</a>. "Our bodies have to work harder to keep us cool because we're not only cooling ourselves but also our babies. This means that pregnant women are more susceptible to heat exhaustion and heat stroke compared to nonpregnant individuals."</p>



<p>Heat can be particularly dangerous during pregnancy because an elevated core body temperature can lead to serious complications.</p>



<p>"You don't want your core body temperature to exceed 102 degrees," warns Rose. "This can lead to heat stroke or heat exhaustion, which are both dangerous for both mother and baby."</p>



<p><strong>Hydration: The key to staying cool</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Staying hydrated</a> is one of the most important steps pregnant women can take to protect themselves in the heat.</p>



<p>"Water is always preferred," says Rose. "But fluids with electrolytes are also beneficial because we lose sodium and potassium through sweat. It's important to replace these, especially on hot summer days."</p>



<p>However, not all drinks are created equal. "Avoid caffeinated beverages like coffee, soda and certain teas, as they can dehydrate you," Rose advises. "Sports drinks and other sugary drinks shouldn't replace water. Pure water is the best and healthiest option."</p>



<p>Rose recommends pregnant women drink at least 64 ounces of water daily and increase that amount if spending time in hot weather.</p>



<p>"Your hydration needs to increase when you’re pregnant, especially in the heat," says Rose. "It's essential to stay ahead of your thirst. If you're thirsty, you're already behind on your hydration."</p>



<p><strong>Practical tips for staying cool</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dress for the heat</strong>: Wear loose, breathable fabrics, such as cotton or moisture-wicking clothes, to stay cool. Avoid tight items that can trap heat and cause discomfort.</li>



<li><strong>Seek shade</strong>: When planning outdoor activities, always look for shaded areas. "Try to stay under shade trees, near water or use a splash pad to keep cool," suggests Rose. "If you're going to a park, sit under a tree. If you're near water, keep your feet in it to help lower your body temperature."</li>



<li><strong>Recognize the signs of overheating</strong>: Pregnant women should be vigilant about the signs of overheating, which include increased sweating, dizziness, fatigue, unquenchable thirst and muscle cramps. "If you experience these symptoms, get out of the sun, hydrate and use cool cloths on your neck, armpits and groin to lower your body temperature," says Rose.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Understanding heat exhaustion and heat stroke</strong></p>



<p>It's crucial to understand the symptoms and risks of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heat-exhaustion/symptoms-causes/syc-20373250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heat exhaustion</a> symptoms include headache, dizziness, confusion, loss of appetite, nausea, extreme thirst and muscle cramps.</p>



<p>"If you experience these signs, move to a cool area," Rose explains. "Place cool washcloths or towels on your head, neck, armpits and groin. Hydrate, and you should start feeling better within 30 minutes."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heat-stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20353581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heat stroke</a>, a more severe condition, includes symptoms such as not sweating despite feeling hot, high body temperature, shortness of breath, confusion, rapid breathing and seizures.</p>



<p>"These symptoms require immediate medical attention," Rose stresses. "Heat stroke can be life-threatening for both the mother and the baby."</p>



<p><strong>Additional precautions</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Plan ahead</strong>: Always have an action plan for outdoor activities. "Pack extra water, ice packs, and have current medications handy," Rose advises. "Be aware of the heat index and air quality, especially if traveling. Be prepared to find air conditioning or a shady tree if you start to feel overheated."</li>



<li><strong>Use technology</strong>: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a Heat &amp; Health Tracker app, which provides information on heat risk and air quality. "This can be a valuable tool for planning your day," says Rose. "You can input your zip code and get real-time updates on the heat index and air quality."</li>
</ul>



<p>Rose also highlights the importance of recognizing when professional medical help is needed.</p>



<p>"If you haven't urinated in over 24 hours, or if you're experiencing frequent uterine cramps, contact your obstetrics department," she advises. "I've seen many cases where women underestimated the heat and ended up with serious complications. Many didn't realize how much fluid they need until they start feeling dizzy and experiencing cramps. Patients then come to the clinic needing IV fluids to rehydrate."</p>



<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>



<p>"Pregnancy is a time of great care and precaution," Rose concludes. "The summer heat adds an extra layer of complexity, but with the right precautions and awareness, expectant mothers can enjoy the season safely. Always prioritize hydration, wear the right clothing, seek shade and be vigilant about the signs of overheating. Your health and your baby's health depend on it."</p>

<p>About 1 in 8 men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Many of those patients undergo surgery to get rid of the cancerous tumor.</p>

<p>"Most of the time, prostate cancer is a slower-growing type of tumor," says Dr. Tollefson. "Physically removing it could then cure one from cancer."</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="632" height="598" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/prostate-tumor-632px.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-262543" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/prostate-tumor-632px.jpg 632w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/prostate-tumor-632px-300x284.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Medical illustration of a normal and cancerous prostate.</figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Advancements in robotic prostate surgery</h3>



<p>He says surgery is a common option for many men, especially if the cancer is contained in the prostate. Medical innovation has improved cancer removal surgeries. Now, there's an upgrade to the robotic prostatectomy procedure.</p>



<p>"Instead of all of the instruments coming in through separate incisions, they come in through a single incision, and the robot is able to then branch out within the abdomen and remove the prostate," explains Dr. Tollefson.</p>



<p>Patients have a faster recovery and reduced pain with the single-port robotic procedure.</p>



<p>Other prostate cancer treatment options can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Radiation therapy.</li>



<li>Ablative therapies.</li>



<li>Hormone therapy.</li>



<li>Chemotherapy.</li>



<li>Immunotherapy.</li>



<li>Targeted drug therapy.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/sexual-health/in-depth/testosterone-therapy/art-20045728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Testosterone</a> is a key male hormone that is responsible for characteristics like hair growth, muscle mass and deepening of the voice. As men age, testosterone levels gradually decline, particularly over 40.</p>



<p>"The main complaint I see as a urologist is a lack of interest in sexual functioning," says Dr. Broderick. "But fatigue, changes in mental acuity, less stamina and very often mild degrees of depression are associated with falling testosterone."</p>



<p>In some cases, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/testosterone-topical-application-route/description/drg-20073444?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infertility</a> can be tied to low testosterone. But presenting these symptoms or traits is not an automatic diagnosis.</p>



<p>"Not all men need testosterone," says Dr. Broderick. "It's very important that this diagnosis is properly made based on symptoms but also the serum level of testosterone in the blood."</p>



<p>When it comes to treating low testosterone, the most common way is a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/testosterone-topical-application-route/description/drg-20073444?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cream</a> applied to the upper arm, but <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/testosterone-intramuscular-route-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20095183?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">injectable</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/testosterone-oral-route/proper-use/drg-20461351?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pill</a> forms of testosterone are also available.</p>



<p>"Each of those avenues is designed to get you back to a normal level of testosterone," says Dr. Broderick. "What you should notice is that within 48 to 72 hours of your dosage that your desire has improved."</p>

<p>"I like to tell patients that the prostate is kind of like an orange with a straw going right through the middle of it. And as we age, the prostate gets larger and larger. And the straw going through the middle gets compressed by the tissue of the prostate, makes it harder for the bladder to push urine through the urethra," says Dr. Cheney.</p>



<p>Enlarged prostate symptoms can include frequent or urgent urination, a weak urine stream and the inability to empty your bladder.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389164" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>"I see men who get up at night to pee, and they get up again and again. They get poor sleep, It can really affect their lifestyle. So they're always looking for a restroom wherever they go, they can't drive long distances because they have to stop and urinate very frequently," says Dr. Cheney.</p>



<p>If you suffer from any of those symptoms, Dr. Cheney first recommends a few lifestyle modifications.</p>



<p>"You can tell a man to avoid excess fluids. Some men, they don't realize how much fluid they're drinking. The more fluid you drink, the more often you're going to have to urinate. The types of fluids also matter. So, if a man is drinking a lot of caffeine, a lot of alcohol, especially before bed, that can cause nighttime issues with urination," Dr. Cheney says.</p>



<p>He says talk to your healthcare team about your concerns. An enlarged prostate also can be treated effectively with medications or procedures.</p>
