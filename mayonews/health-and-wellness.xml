<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I see ads for collagen powder and supplements everywhere now, and my sister swears by it for fighting wrinkles. Does it actually help prevent aging? What exactly is collagen?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Collagen has been seen in the media in regard to having anti-aging properties. At least 30% of your body — skin, bones, tendons, organs — is made up of collagen. Collagen is a protein of the supportive tissue of the skin, which helps give it its tightness and suppleness. As you lose collagen over time, this can lead to sagging and thinning of the skin and the development of wrinkles, which can make you look aged. Much of the anti-aging industry focuses on maintaining or, hopefully, building collagen.</p>



<p>Collagen comes in the form of over-the-counter dietary <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-do-collagen-and-biotin-supplements-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supplements</a> such as capsules or powder, but it also can be consumed through gelatin found in foods such as Jell-O and marshmallows. Studies are unclear as to whether taking collagen by mouth, either through diet or by supplement, is beneficial. Oftentimes when research on collagen is performed, it is not performed on humans, or it may be performed on humans but in an amount that is impractical for your daily diet or habits over time.</p>



<p>When considering topical collagen products such as serums and moisturizers, keep in mind that collagen is a large protein with a complex structure that cannot be absorbed directly through the skin. Over-the-counter products may be labeled with fancy words such as "high hydrolyzed collagen peptides," which claim that the collagen's chemical structure is more absorbable in the gut lining or on the top of the skin so that it seemingly would be more active.</p>



<p>Topical products that are not medications are not registered through the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food and Drug Administration</a> in the same way that prescription medication is. Similarly, oral supplements are not regulated by the FDA in the same way that food and oral medications are regulated. With numerous products available on the market, it is difficult to tell how it has been tested, what it contains and if those ingredients are helpful, neutral or potentially harmful.</p>



<p>Another thing to be aware of is that in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/dermatology/sections/overview/ovc-20420526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dermatology</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/plastic-reconstructive-surgery-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20473067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plastic surgery</a>, as well as facial, ear, nose and throat surgery, collagen and fillers in the skin are given through other treatment methods in the office, such as by injection. So, if someone is interested in anti-aging properties and bringing more volume to the deeper layers of their skin, at this time, prescription or active medical intervention in a physician's office is suggested versus over-the-counter oral or topical treatment. If someone is interested in learning more, they should consult with their healthcare team.</p>



<p>The bottom line is, we don't know if topical or oral supplementation of collagen is beneficial for anti-aging purposes. There's no magic pill to reverse aging. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sunburn/in-depth/sun-damage/art-20546834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sun exposure</a> is a major cause of wrinkles, especially for people with fair skin. And <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20smoking%20causes%20lung,and%20some%20types%20of%20leukemia." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking</a> causes narrowing of the blood vessels in the outer layers of the skin and damages collagen. The most effective way to support your collagen for anti-aging is to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking/basics/quitsmoking-basics/hlv-20049487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid smoking</a> and exposure to secondhand smoke, limit alcohol use and consistently wear <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/sunscreen-agent-topical-application-route/proper-use/drg-20070255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunscreen</a>. <em>—</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/davis-dawn-marie-r-m-d/bio-20054974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dawn Davis, M.D.</strong></a><em><strong>, Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.</strong> </em></p>

<p>Hormone therapy is a treatment that uses medications containing hormones like estrogen or progesterone to replace those the body stops producing during <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a>. It can be a powerful tool for managing menopausal <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;"While hormone therapy can significantly improve quality of life and overall health for many women, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/smith-taryn-l-m-d/bio-20503248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Taryn Smith</a>, a Mayo Clinic internist and women’s health specialist.</p>



<p>She emphasizes the importance of a personalized medicine approach to hormone therapy, allowing healthcare providers to consider your health and potential risks.</p>



<p>Having discussions around menopause is important because it's often not a topic that is openly discussed or acknowledged, despite its significance and importance, she says. Menopause is a natural biological process, marking the time that a woman ends her menstrual cycle. It's diagnosed after a woman goes 12 months without a menstrual period.</p>



<p>"Many women don’t know how to navigate menopause and the symptoms that come along with it, such as <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-help-with-hot-flashes-due-to-menopause/">hot flashes</a> and night sweats. Hormone therapy is used to manage many of these symptoms," says Dr. Smith. "But it's not for everybody."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Four things Dr. Smith wants women to know about hormone therapy</h2>



<p><strong>Menopause symptoms and hormone therapy</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hormone therapy</a> is used to manage symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, trouble sleeping, and irritability.</p>



<p>"For the average healthy woman, these options are very safe. But if there are any concerns about these risk factors, it’s best to consult your physician or your women’s health specialist," she says.</p>



<p><strong>Treatment options </strong><br>Hormone therapy is a prescribed medication that can come in different forms, including patches, gels, sprays and oral medications.</p>



<p>Those options may include "A patch you wear on the skin, almost like a bandage in the lower groin or over the buttocks. We have gels that you can rub into the inner thigh and sprays that can be sprayed on the forearm. We also have some oral options.&nbsp; With all the options available, typically, we can find a good option that meets the average woman's needs," says Dr. Smith.</p>



<p><strong>Expected outcomes</strong><br>After starting hormone therapy, women can expect relief from symptoms. In many cases, hot flashes can be completely resolved, improving the woman’s quality of life.</p>



<p>"Often, we're able to completely resolve hot flashes. But if we cannot completely resolve them, we hope to get significant relief at least and help a woman restore her quality of life," she says.</p>



<p><strong>Safety concerns</strong><br>While there are safety concerns associated with hormone therapy, such as potential risks of breast cancer, stroke, or heart disease, it is generally safe for the average woman who is close to the menopause transition and younger than 60.</p>



<p>"For the average healthy woman, these options are very safe. But if there are any concerns about these risk factors, it's best to consult your physician or your women's health specialist," says Dr Smith.</p>



<p>For those who are unable to take hormone therapy or choose not to, there are FDA-approved <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/whats-the-best-nonhormonal-therapy-for-hot-flashes-experts-release-new-menopause-therapy-guidelines/">nonhormonal treatments</a> for menopause symptoms. Talk with your healthcare team to find out what is the best option.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC</strong>: I have a family member taking a prescription weight-loss drug. She has been successful thus far, which I know is improving her health. She admitted, though, that she often eats less than 1,000 calories per day. How can I encourage her weight-loss journey, but also ensure she is getting adequate nutrition?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> While <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss-drugs/art-20044832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss medications</a> are truly having a positive effect on many Americans’ health, it is important to also talk about nutrition. Not just the "please eat healthy and exercise" narrative (despite its truth), but making sure that patients on weight-loss medications are able to manage side effects, stay hydrated and consume adequate nutrients.</p>



<p>Medications for obesity approved by the Food and Drug Administration often work by decreasing appetite and increasing fullness. Popular <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/expert-answers/byetta/faq-20057955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glucagon-like peptide 1</a> medications slow gastric emptying, or the rate at which food leaves the stomach. This can lead to common side effects such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nausea/basics/definition/sym-20050736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/constipation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">constipation</a> and vomiting. For most, these side effects are mild and temporary. They are likely to be most bothersome at medication start or with a dose increase, and they may resolve or improve within days to weeks. Keep your doctor informed about any severe side effects, and reach out if you are unable to eat or drink.</p>



<p>For many, side effects become manageable with time and intention. Users should eat slowly, avoid large meals, drink plenty of fluids and maintain protein intake. If calories become a concern (less than 1,200 a day), work on increased calorie and nutrient density with meals, beverages and snacks. Items such as Greek yogurt, smoothies, protein shakes and soups are often nutrient-dense and easy to digest. Soft, blended or liquid meals may be better tolerated. Remember that hydration is crucial because the lack of it may cause or worsen side effects including nausea, constipation, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/headache/basics/definition/sym-20050800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headaches</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/definition/sym-20050894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a>. Make sure to have water or another healthy beverage on hand, and sip throughout the day.</p>



<p>Building a bank of habits is key for the long haul. While more medication options will be available in the coming years, it’s important to consider skillset, should someone need or choose to go off the weight-loss drug. Weight regain can be a scary and very real concept. Just as someone who relies on a medication to keep their blood pressure in a healthy range, eliminating the medication would likely result in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension</a> again. That's why we use the word "tool" when it comes to weight-loss medications, procedures and surgeries. They are an added benefit, but that one tool is not doing all the work. By focusing on nutritious meals and establishing an exercise routine immediately, the groundwork is set for long-term success, regardless of whether the tool is being used in the future.</p>



<p>Rapid weight loss, whether from lifestyle changes, medications or procedures, will lead to some muscle mass loss. Focus on and divide sources of protein from food or beverages throughout the day. To not add volume to meals, brainstorm ways to add protein without adding bulk, like adding a protein powder or Greek yogurt to a morning smoothie, dipping veggies in cottage cheese or adding beans to a favorite soup. Eating protein as the first item in the meal is also a helpful strategy to make sure it's not left on the plate.</p>



<p>Engaging in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/strength-training/art-20046670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strength training</a> is equally as important. Start with body weight if needed, and increase weight or difficulty over time. Can't nail a push-up yet? That’s OK! Practice first by using the wall. Then try from the arm of a couch. Progress to your knees, and don't feel bad if a push-up from your toes just isn't going to happen. The goal here is to maintain and/or build all muscle groups, regardless of whether that pushup would get you through boot camp. Other <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/strength-training/art-20046031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">body-weight exercises</a> include squats, lunges, planks, triceps dips and wall sits. Lastly, enlist help. A multidisciplinary team is an excellent resource to address your needs and concerns. In addition to the medication prescriber, patients may benefit from programs designed specifically for weight-loss medication users.

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My entire family was recently affected by pink eye, including my mom, my nephews, my sister and even her dog! How is it so contagious? And what is it?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Pink eye is an inflammation of the lining of the eyelid and eyeball. The medical term for pink eye is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pink-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20376355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conjunctivitis</a>. Just as its name, pink eye, tells us, the most noticeable symptom will be a pink or red irritated eye or eyes. Other symptoms can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Itchiness in one or both eyes.</li>



<li>A gritty feeling in one or both eyes.</li>



<li>Discharge in one or both eyes. This can form a crust overnight that can prevent one or both eyes from opening the next morning.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/watery-eyes/basics/definition/sym-20050821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watery eyes</a> or tearing.</li>
</ul>



<p>Pink eye is most commonly caused by a virus, but a bacterial infection or allergies also can be to blame. In babies, pink eye can be caused by a tear duct that is not completely opened. Most viruses will go away on their own. If the cause is bacterial, we will recommend treating the affected eye(s) with an antibiotic drop.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, pink eye is quite contagious, just like many other infectious diseases such as colds and influenza. Patients can be at risk of catching pink eye if they touch someone who is infected and then rub their eyes or face. For this reason, it is important to be consistent with hand hygiene and hand-washing, and avoid touching other things around someone who may be ill.</p>



<p>Pink eye can be a pain, but don't worry — it rarely affects your vision. If you do experience blurred vision, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/eye-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eye pain</a>, light sensitivity (photophobia) or feel as if something is stuck in your eye, seek urgent care. If you wear <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/contact-lenses/overview/ovc-20518723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact lenses</a>, you should stop wearing them as soon as you notice pink eye symptoms. If your symptoms don't begin to improve within 12 to 24 hours, you should make an appointment with your eye doctor to make sure you don't have a more serious infection related to contact lens use.</p>



<p>Pink eye is one of our more common reasons to stay home from day care, school or even work if you're an adult, because even adults can get pink eye. If it's a bacterial infection, patients need at least 24 hours of antibiotic therapy before returning to normal activities. If it's viral in nature, you may have to wait at home a little bit longer since there is no treatment other than time. If it is allergic in nature, one can safely attend school and work since allergies are not contagious. We generally recommend those patients stay at home until they feel better.</p>



<p>Doing warm compresses on the eyes can help alleviate some of the symptoms. Rest will also help you heal. If your pink eye is from allergies, using appropriate <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/in-depth/allergy-medications/art-20047403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allergy medications</a> can help. Unfortunately, we are often contagious with viruses or bacteria that cause pink eye before we even have symptoms. That is why it's so important to be consistent and mindful about our <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/hand-washing/art-20046253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hand hygiene</a> and careful about being around those who may not be feeling well. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ardon-tina-m-d/bio-20055713?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Tina Ardon, M.D.</strong></a><em><strong>,</strong> <strong>Family Medicine,</strong> <strong>Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> More and more of my friends are following the plant-based diet trend. Is that the same as going vegan? Is it healthy for you? What can I actually eat?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Plant-based foods go beyond a "boring salad." With a <a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/weight-management-1/newsfeed-post/choosing-whole-foods-for-a-healthier-you/">whole-food</a> <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/steps-to-start-eating-plant-based/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plant-based</a> diet, we focus on eating foods that are primarily coming from plants and that occur in their natural state. Veganism also takes that into account but can incorporate other social and justice factors into that lifestyle.</p>



<p>Certainly, it can be difficult to go 100% whole-food plant-based, especially if that's something you're not used to. My recommendation is to start by introducing an additional fruit, vegetable or whole food into your diet slowly and one at a time. One of the things I recommend is taking what is part of your normal routine and simply adding to it. So, if you're a person who enjoys eating oatmeal for breakfast, perhaps you'll add an additional serving of fruit.</p>



<p>One of the biggest misconceptions people have when they hear about plant-based is that they might not get enough <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein#:~:text=How%20much%20protein%20do%20you,per%20kilogram%20of%20body%20weight.">protein</a> because they're so used to eating meat, whether that's from animal protein, dairy products or eggs. But the fact is, we can get a lot of our protein from plant-based foods such as legumes, lentils, tofu, nuts and seeds.</p>



<p>Another way to look at protein needs is to look at what is on your plate. When building your plate, half of the plate should be vegetables, a quarter of the plate can be a protein and the last quarter of the plate could be a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carbohydrate</a>. The plate method is visualizing what's on your plate to help meet your daily needs. The protein of choice should be about the size of a deck of cards. Hopefully, in the future, you can supplement some of your animal proteins with plant protein.</p>



<p>Having a variety of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20050989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fruits and vegetables</a> is equally important as meeting the recommended intake of five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. The colors of different fruits and vegetables signify phytonutrients that can boost your immune system. Buying seasonal products can get us to try new foods that we may not typically go for year-round. Sometimes we might find that we like (or maybe not like) those new foods that we try. We might want to dive deeper into, "Is it the flavor that I don't like or the texture? And if so, can I cook it or prepare it a different way to make it more enjoyable?"</p>



<p>For example, I am very sensitive to raw broccoli. It has a strange aftertaste to me. But then I discovered broccoli sprouts, which are broccoli plants that are 3-5 days old. Broccoli sprouts carry a cancer-protection effect. So I'm able to add broccoli sprouts in place of having the full adult broccoli. I'll typically use it on top of a salad or add it to a sandwich as an added crunch. It's a way I can get my broccoli nutrients in.</p>



<p>One of my favorite go-to ingredients for protein are lentils. Lentils provide an adequate amount of protein and are quite easy to add to any dish. I like to add lentils to any chilis or soups that I'm making as a thickener or as a meat alternative for meatless meatballs or tacos. Lentils are an important part of a plant-based diet because they're not only high in fiber but also contain great sources of potassium as well as protein. They've been shown to lower the lipid profile in people who are overweight or obese with type 2 diabetes. They're also a great source of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/probiotics/faq-20058065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prebiotics</a> to help diversify the gut and protect it from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/digestive-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digestive diseases</a>.</p>



<p>Another important part of the whole-food, plant-based diet is the incorporation of <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/can-fungi-flavor-better-health-what-to-know-about-mushroom-coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mushrooms</a>. Interestingly, mushrooms are not vegetables or fruit, but a fungus. These fungi have been well studied throughout medical nutrition, and they've been shown to have immune-boosting properties supporting brain health and antioxidant effects. Mushrooms have a high-flavor profile and can add extra flavor to any dish, especially when cooked. They also can take on all the flavors of the seasonings around them.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal is to nourish our bodies in a way that is sustainable and that works for us. Having a completely 100% whole-food, plant-based diet might not be for everyone, but we do know that incorporating fruits and vegetables in the diet serves beneficial and long-term health effects. So, if that means adding one thing at a time, or shying away from one of those foods that we typically avoid, such as red meats, dairy, or unnecessary <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-best-cooking-fats-for-healthy-cholesterol-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oils and fats</a>, then we do so slowly. If you get stuck at any point in the process, you can always talk to your healthcare team for extra assistance. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/nguyen-christine-q-d-o/bio-20536365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Christine Nguyen, D.O.</em></strong></a><em><strong>, Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</strong></em></p>

<p>When it comes to food choices, there can be plenty to pick from.&nbsp;Dr. Nguyen hopes you'll choose carefully.</p>



<p>"Ideally, we'll pick things that are whole grains rather than refined carbs, or those white-colored carbohydrates," she says.</p>



<p>Carbohydrates are a source of energy, but not all carbs are the same.</p>



<p>Simple carbs, found in&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-are-ultraprocessed-foods-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly processed</a>&nbsp;sugary snacks for instance, are considered "bad" carbs because they can lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar and provide empty calories. Complex carbs, found naturally in grains, fruits and vegetables, are considered "good" carbs and are vital to a healthy diet.</p>



<p>"Whole grains are important because they pack vitamins and minerals that we might not get from other places. They can make up the bulk of our meal to make them filling and nutritious," says Dr. Nguyen.</p>



<p>Consider swapping healthy or good carbs in the place of refined or bad carbs. Try fiber-rich foods, such as quinoa; vegetables, like broccoli, carrots and sweet potatoes; and fresh fruits, like apples and blackberries.</p>

<p>Fiber is beneficial not only for our gut health but also in order to improve our cholesterol levels, reduce our risk of cardiovascular disease, improve anti-inflammatory properties and boost the immune system," Dr. Nguyen says</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I've never had my blood drawn before, but I have to go in for testing soon. Honestly, I'm pretty nervous about it. What can I expect?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> It can be a little nerve-wracking at first, but having blood drawn is a quick procedure that can be painless — sometimes, people don't even know that the collection has started!</p>



<p>It's important that you first ask your healthcare team what your lab tests are and why they're being collected. This can help you prepare and know what time of day to schedule your appointment. For example, if you need to be fasting prior to your blood draw, it may be preferable to schedule it first thing in the morning before you have eaten.</p>



<p>When it comes to the day of the blood collection, stay hydrated, stay warm and try to stay as calm as possible (try taking some deep breaths). The phlebotomist assigned to perform your blood draw you will ask you several questions before they get started, such as your date of birth and full name. There are often patients with similar-sounding names, so we try to ask for as many identifiers as we can to make sure we can confirm who you are. It's critical that our phlebotomists get the right blood from the right patient and get the results into the right medical record. Without the right specimens, we can't do our work.</p>



<p>The phlebotomist will ask you to make a fist and tap on your veins to identify a vein they can collect blood from. It's key for them to be able to not only see but feel a vein, make sure it's big enough and that it's not going to roll away from the needle during the collection. This is a skill that they get during their training and certification, and they become experts after many years of experience with patients. Clenching your fist increases the amount of blood that's in your vein, which then makes it more prominent and easier to see and feel.</p>



<p>Veins in your hands often have very thin walls, so it's difficult to get into the vein and not damage it. This is why you are more likely to get bruising on your hand. The veins that are in your elbow joint are very thick and easy to access, and they usually heal without much bruising, depending on the patient. Sometimes the veins in your hand are the only veins that the phlebotomist can identify, so then they'll have to use those.</p>



<p>All in all, it only takes one or two minutes for them to identify the vein, collect the specimens and make sure that you're healthy enough to leave. There's no need to eat right after a blood draw unless you've been fasting or you feel a bit woozy. Most people don't feel any different after a blood collection, but some do report being dizzy. This is unrelated to the amount of blood that's collected, though. You have plenty of blood in your body (approximately 5,000 milliliters) compared to what's being taken. Dizziness is usually the result of the patient being anxious or worried about the blood draw.</p>



<p>Your blood tells us a vast number of things, and blood testing can be very complex. Phlebotomists are incredibly important individuals whose work often goes unnoticed. All our testing relies on having your blood collected in the right way, which makes phlebotomists the foundation of our clinical practice. We couldn't run a hospital without them. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/craig-fiona-e-m-d/bio-20156652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fiona Craig, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix</em></strong></p>

<p>Diagnosing a person with autism spectrum disorder can be challenging. It's a medical condition that no blood test, brain scan or objective test can pinpoint. And because of each person's distinctive pattern of symptoms, it can be hard to determine its severity.</p>



<p>As people gain familiarity with autism, however, they are becoming more open to discussing the diagnosis and seeking treatment. Society is also becoming more motivated to learn about neurodivergent conditions, including autism.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is autism spectrum disorder?</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352928" target="_blank">Autism spectrum disorder</a>&nbsp;is a condition related to brain development that affects how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. It includes conditions that previously were considered separate, including autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of pervasive developmental disorder.</p>



<p>Autism affects children and adults in three areas: communication, social interaction and behaviors. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/could-my-child-have-autism-spectrum-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Children with autism spectrum disorder</a> may struggle with recognizing their emotions and may feel them more intensely. Regulating their anger and frustration can be difficult and lead to intense bursts of emotions. Children with autism also have higher rates of anxiety and depression.</p>



<p>Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a distinctive pattern of behavior and level of severity. A healthcare professional will generally describe the severity of the condition based on the person's level of impairments and how those affect their ability to function.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Can't start a conversation, keep one going or can only start one to make requests or label items.</li>



<li>Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions.</li>



<li>Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings.</li>



<li>Doesn't speak or has delayed speech.</li>



<li>Fails to respond to their name or appears not to hear you sometimes.</li>



<li>Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice.</li>



<li>Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression.</li>



<li>Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive.</li>



<li>Prefers playing alone.</li>



<li>Repeats words or phrases verbatim but doesn't understand how to use them.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Awareness of autism behaviors</h2>



<p>According to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/23904/CDC-Autism-rate-rises-to-1-in-36-children" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, the latest research from 2023 shows that 1 in 36 children was diagnosed with autism. This is an increase from 1 in 44 children just&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/ss/ss7202a1.htm?s_cid=ss7202a1_e&amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM101985&amp;ACSTrackingLabel=This%20Week%20in%20MMWR%20-%20Vol.%2072%2C%20March%2024%2C%202023&amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM101985" target="_blank">two years ago</a>.</p>



<p>Children tend to become more aware of their diagnosis around puberty. Kids recognize their differences from their peers and notice their struggle to fit in. They might notice they're not being invited to participate in certain activities or being accepted in the same way as many of their peers. Social interactions become more crucial for young people in middle and high school, which can be stressful for someone on the autism spectrum.</p>



<p>Parents may notice symptoms early on when they see how their child's behaviors, communication and social interactions differ from their peer group. It can be challenging for parents to accept that their child is different from other children. Parents may feel guilty and responsible, even though this developmental condition has no known cause.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Living with autism spectrum disorder</h2>



<p>As the number of people living with autism spectrum disorder increases, it's critical to seek out educational opportunities that can help with understanding autism spectrum disorder. What are the strengths and disadvantages of the child? How can that knowledge be used to strengthen the skills of a child with autism? Answering these questions can help identify specific interventions to teach skills relevant to the child.</p>



<p>For example, if a child struggles with regulating emotions, this can be addressed through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/autism-treatments-and-therapies">treatment</a>&nbsp;to help them gain more control over their emotions and behaviors.</p>



<p>No cure exists for autism spectrum disorder, and there's no one-size-fits-all treatment. The goal of treatment is to maximize your child's ability to function by reducing their autism spectrum disorder symptoms and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/helping-your-childs-education-through-an-iep-or-504-plan">supporting their development and learning</a>. Early intervention during the preschool years is key.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment options may include:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Behavior and communication therapies</li>



<li>Educational therapies</li>



<li>Family therapies</li>



<li>Medications</li>
</ul>



<p>When you have a child or loved one with autism, the chance of them having anxiety or depression is increased. Evaluating and treating these symptoms can improve their level of functioning and their overall mental health.</p>



<p>One of the most critical things parents, friends or classmates of someone diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder can do is educate yourself about it while recognizing their strengths.</p>



<p>You can develop increased compassion for your loved ones, classmates, friends and colleagues by recognizing and understanding more about the condition. While you can't eliminate a child's autism or wait for them to outgrow it, you can minimize some of its symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>

They even worked out a healthy eating plan, and you want to stick to it. And you do well for many days, but then something upsetting happens, and your first thought is food.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047342?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emotional eating</a> is eating to suppress or soothe negative emotions, such as stress, anger, fear, boredom, sadness and loneliness. Food also can be a distraction. If you're worried about an upcoming event or stewing over a conflict, for instance, you may focus on eating comfort food instead of dealing with the painful situation. </p>



<p>Emotional eating often leads to eating too much, especially overeating foods that are sweet, fatty and high in calories. And this can sabotage your weight-loss efforts. </p>



<p>When negative emotions threaten to trigger emotional eating, try these nine tips to stay on track:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Keep a food diary.<br></strong>Write down what you eat, how much you eat, when you eat, how you're feeling when you eat and how hungry you are. Over time, you might see patterns that reveal the connection between mood and food.</li><li><strong>Tame your stress.<br></strong>If stress contributes to your emotional eating, try a stress management technique, such as yoga, meditation or deep breathing.</li><li><strong>Have a hunger reality check.<br></strong>Is your hunger physical or emotional? If you ate just a few hours ago and don't have a rumbling stomach, you're probably not hungry. Give the craving time to pass.</li><li><strong>Get support.<br></strong>You're more likely to give in to emotional eating if you lack a good support network. Lean on family and friends, or consider joining a support group.</li><li><strong>Fight boredom.<br></strong>Instead of snacking when you're not hungry, distract yourself and substitute a healthier behavior. Take a walk, watch a movie, play with your pet, listen to music, read, surf the internet or call a friend.</li><li><strong>Remove temptation.<br></strong>Don't keep hard-to-resist comfort foods in your home. And if you feel angry or blue, postpone your trip to the grocery store until your emotions are in check.</li><li><strong>Don't deprive yourself.<br></strong>When trying to lose weight, you might limit calories too much, eat the same foods repeatedly and banish treats. This may just increase your food cravings, especially in response to emotions. Eat satisfying amounts of healthier foods, enjoy an occasional treat and get plenty of variety to curb cravings.</li><li><strong>Snack healthy.<br></strong>If you feel the urge to eat between meals, choose a healthy snack, such as fresh fruit, vegetables with low-fat dip, nuts or unbuttered popcorn. Or try lower-calorie versions of your favorite foods to see if they satisfy your craving.</li><li><strong>Learn from setbacks.<br></strong>If you have an episode of emotional eating, forgive yourself and start fresh the next day. Try to learn from the experience and plan for how you can prevent it in the future. Focus on the positive changes you're making in your eating habits and give yourself credit for making changes that will lead to better health.</li></ul>
