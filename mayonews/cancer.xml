<p>Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center and Columbia University recently announced being named  the recipients of a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-columbia-university-receive-10-6-million-grant-from-nci-to-advance-glioblastoma-research-with-mathematical-oncology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$10.6 million grant from the National Cancer</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-columbia-university-receive-10-6-million-grant-from-nci-to-advance-glioblastoma-research-with-mathematical-oncology/"> Institute</a> to advance research in fighting glioblastoma - one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms of brain cancer. </p>



<p>Every year, thousands are diagnosed with the disease. Many are given little time to live. The prognosis is often poorer for older patients.</p>



<p>Researchers are searching for a cure. Meanwhile a team at Mayo Clinic is also looking for ways to help elderly patients diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-is-glioblastoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a> live longer and maintain quality of life. </p>



<p>Now, an investigational study at Mayo Clinic using an innovative approach to treatment has shown promise in improving health outcomes for people like Richard Casper.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Love at first sight</h2>



<p>Richard and Carol Casper were in their early 20s when they met. Carol was smitten, but not sure Richard would call her again.</p>



<p>"So, anyway, he did," recalls Carol with a twinkle in her eye. "That's where it all started in 1962, and we got married in 1964." </p>



<p>Children soon followed, and their family began traveling the world with Richard's career in the U.S. Air Force.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="802" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-802x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378587" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-802x1024.png 802w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-235x300.png 235w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-768x981.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM.png 844w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Richard and Carol on their wedding day in 1964</strong>                                                                                                                                                 Photo courtesy: Casper family</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The day their world changed&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After nearly 30 years of military service, the couple was looking forward to retirement. Then suddenly, in 2019, Richard suffered a seizure and their world came crashing down. Testing began to identify the cause of his seizures. </p>



<p>Ultimately surgery confirmed the family's worst fear - brain cancer.</p>



<p>"That's when we got the definite diagnosis that it was <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-is-glioblastoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma, stage 4,</a>" says Carol. Doctors told the family Richard had less than a year to live.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We were hit with a bomb."</p><cite>Carol Casper, Richard's wife</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Glioblastoma: The deadliest form of brain cancer&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Glioblastoma is one of the most complex and fast-growing forms of brain cancer. It is also the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, though it can strike at any age. It can form in the spinal cord or the brain.</p>



<p>"It carries the worst prognosis, and it has to do with the aggressiveness of the cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist with Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona. "Despite our best treatments, we see patients continue to recur, which requires additional treatments over time." &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://braintumor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Brain Tumor Society</a>, more than 14,490 Americans are expected to be diagnosed in 2023. They estimate approximately 10,000 will die from the disease.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research to improve patient outcomes</h2>



<p>Dr. Vora has been researching brain tumors and ways to improve patient outcomes for the past two decades. His team is now investigating an innovative treatment protocol for elderly patients, like Richard, who are often given less time than average to live. </p>



<p>"Most of these patients are in the six- to nine-month range," says Dr. Vora. "We're looking for ways of providing more effective and better treatments for patients in terms of both quality and quantity of life."</p>



<p>Richard sought treatment at Mayo Clinic in Arizona under the care of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-alyx-b-m-d/bio-20055164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alyx Porter, M.D</a>., a neuro-oncologist. "When people come in, it is one of the scariest times in their life," says Dr. Porter. "My job is to provide them with comfort, reassurance and direction as to what the next steps will be."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Let me do the worrying, and you all do the living."</p><cite>Neuro-oncologist Dr. Alyx Porter speaking to the Casper family</cite></blockquote></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic's multidisciplinary approach</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic's healthcare model is based on a team approach. Physicians from a variety of disciplines work together to explore the best treatment options for a patient and deliver the highest level of care.</p>



<p>Richard's family was aware there was likely no cure. What&nbsp;they wanted was more time than his prognosis.&nbsp;His healthcare team agreed Richard was an ideal candidate for the clinical trial. Richard told doctors he was ready to be a participant.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Sign me up. I just need to get my balance back, and I think I'll be able to roll with the punch."&nbsp;</p><cite>Richard Casper </cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Targeting cancer cells with advanced medical imaging</h2>



<p>Radiation and chemotherapy are often used to try and slow progression of the cancer. The study is investigating an innovative approach researchers hope will help elderly glioblastoma patients live longer with fewer symptoms of the cancer and side effects from treatment.</p>



<p>It incorporates the use of an advanced medical imaging technique, called 18F-DOPA PET and MRI to target specific areas of the brain for treatment and spare healthy tissue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="557" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1024x557.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378592" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1024x557.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-300x163.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-768x418.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1536x836.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-2048x1114.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Dr. Vora showing how 18F-DOPA PET/MRI is being studied as a way to help improve treatment of glioblastoma</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"18F-DOPA is more or less a special type of sugar that cancer cells take at a faster rate compared to healthy cells that is very specific for glioblastoma. So, with this PET scan, we can actually now identify areas in the brain that are felt to be at highest risk for tumor growth," says Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>The other critical part of this regimen is that it's much more convenient for patients. "Instead of the traditional three to six weeks' worth of radiation, we're able to complete their entire treatment in one to two weeks, which allows more time for patients to stay with their family," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p>The areas are then targeted with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-proton-beam-therapy-bolsters-cancer-treatment/">proton beam therapy</a> to destroy cancer cells. Proton beam therapy is innovative technology that can painlessly deliver higher doses of radiation, in a shorter amount of time, with fewer side effects. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="566" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1024x566.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378595" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1024x566.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-300x166.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-768x424.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1536x849.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-2048x1131.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Proton beam therapy delivers higher doses of radiation in shorter amounts of time often with fewer side effects</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I felt great," says Richard after completing his treatment. "I wouldn't even know I have a brain tumor right now if someone didn't tell me so." </p>



<p>Dr. Porter credits the study's treatment protocol. "With the shorter course of treatment, it saved him from many of the side effects that we know can be as devastating as the disease itself. He was able to finish the treatment, unscathed, walking and dancing into my office thrilled at how good he actually felt."&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Richard beats the odds&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Richard survived almost twice longer than his original prognosis while maintaining his quality of life. "My dad defied the odds and kept going," says Susan, Richard's daughter. "To be almost 2 ½ years in after being told you only have a few months left to live, is quite remarkable."</p>

<p>The Casper family says they're proud of Richard's courage to help in the fight against cancer. "What he went through, and even during the trial, made a big difference in helping other people," says Carol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Richard maintained his valiant battle till the end. He died on March 8, 2023.&nbsp;"All of us at Mayo feel very fortunate to have known Mr. Casper," says Dr. Vora. "He was a very special person."</p>



<p>Dr. Vora presented results of the trial at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology. </p>



<p>"The results are quite promising," says Dr. Vora. "We're hoping to see these results carried on in a larger-scale study. If we continue to see the same types of results, we feel it could be a good option moving forward for all cancer patients."&nbsp;</p>

<p>January is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nccc-online.org/cervical-health-awareness-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cervical Health Awareness Month</a>, which makes this a good time to&nbsp;learn about the connection between HPV and cervical cancer.</p>



<p>Approximately 13,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S., and 4,000 women die of the disease, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Hispanic women have the highest rates of developing cervical cancer, while African American women are at greatest risk of dying from this cancer.</p>



<p>Early-stage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical cancer</a>&nbsp;generally produces no signs or symptoms. Indications of more advanced cervical cancer include vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between periods or after menopause; watery, bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor; and pelvic pain or pain during intercourse.</p>



<p>Various strains of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV</a>, a viral infection, play a role in causing most cervical cancer. When people are exposed to genital HPV, their immune systems usually prevent the virus from doing serious harm. But sometimes the virus survives for years. Eventually, the&nbsp;virus can convert normal cells on the surface of the cervix into cancerous cells. Cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an&nbsp;HPV&nbsp;infection.</p>



<p>Gardasil 9 is an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/in-depth/hpv-vaccine/art-20047292?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV&nbsp;vaccine</a>&nbsp;approved by the Food and Drug Administration for males and females 9 to 45. This vaccine can prevent most cases of cervical cancer if a girl or woman is vaccinated before being exposed to the virus. In addition, this vaccine can prevent vaginal and vulvar cancer in women, as well as genital warts; anal cancer; and mouth, throat, head and neck cancers&nbsp;in men and women.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352506?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment</a>&nbsp;for cervical cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, other health problems you may have and your personal preferences. Treatment may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, immunotherapy and palliative care.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>I was recently diagnosed with cancer. Are there specific foods I should be eating or avoiding?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>It's not about any one food, and it's not about one diet; it's about a dietary pattern. The dietary pattern that organizations such as the American Institute for Cancer Research and the American Cancer Society recommend is a whole-food, plant-predominant diet. The whole food component is very important to emphasize — eating foods as close to nature as possible is key, not ones made in a factory. Aim to arrange half of your plate with a diverse array of colorful vegetables and fruits, a quarter from whole grains, and the rest from healthy sources of protein, especially from plant sources.</p>



<p>The average American consumes at least 63% ultraprocessed foods. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-are-ultraprocessed-foods-2/">Ultraprocessed foods</a> are factory-manufactured, packaged foods (frozen pizza, microwave meals, chips, pastries, cupcakes, muffins, processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages). These foods often have ingredients that are hard to pronounce. Studies show consumption of ultraprocessed food is linked directly to premature mortality or deaths from all causes. Cancer studies done in countries that don't consume nearly the amount of ultraprocessed foods compared to Americans show that not only do the ultraprocessed foods increase the risk of cancer occurring, but after a cancer diagnosis, these foods increase the risk of mortality. When you eat ultraprocessed foods, you're taking away the opportunity for your body to get nutrient-dense foods with vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients and fiber that can help fight cancer and keep it away. </p>



<p>Processed meat, which often includes hot dogs, deli food and sausage, is categorized as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization. To protect yourself against cancer, studies show that it would be best to avoid those foods. For your sources of protein, eat foods such as tofu, edamame, tempeh, fish, poultry and pulses.</p>



<p>What are pulses? Pulses are edible seeds from a legume plant. They include things such as lentils, peas and beans (black, pinto, kidney, chickpeas, etc.). Not only are you replacing animal protein when you consume pulses and soy, but you'll also get a lot of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiber</a>. And in the U.S., there's not a protein deficiency but a fiber deficiency. Soy foods are safe for all cancer patients and are an excellent source of plant protein. Studies show soy may improve survival after breast cancer.</p>



<p>Fiber is an essential nutrient, but only 5% of Americans get enough. A recent meta-analysis from the American Institute for Cancer Research Global Cancer Update Program showed that for every 10-gram increase in fiber in the diet, survival after breast cancer diagnosis improved by 13%. Health benefits of fiber include improved cholesterol, blood sugar regulation, gut health and digestion and weight control. Additionally, nuts and seeds have healthy, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fat/art-20045550#:~:text=Diets%20high%20in%20omega%2D3,heart%20and%20blood%20vessel%20diseases." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatty acids</a> that your body needs and are a great source of fiber and protein. But they are also calorie-dense, so be mindful of the serving size.</p>



<p>Aim to cut out ultraprocessed foods and consume mainly whole, plant-predominant foods:</p>



<ul>
<li>A wide variety of colorful vegetables and whole fruit (not fruit juice).</li>



<li>Whole grains, such as steal cut oats, quinoa, brown rice and barley, to name a few.</li>



<li>Proteins from nonanimal sources.</li>



<li>Foods that aren't made in a factory.</li>



<li>Drink water, not sugar-sweetened beverages.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can have a role in your cancer journey when you think of food as medicine, and that's exciting and empowering. — <strong style="font-size: revert;color: initial;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif"><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mussallem-dawn-m-d-o/bio-20055494?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Dr. Dawn Mussallem</a>, Integrative Medicine and Health, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

<p>Lorie Kirkman embraces a lifestyle of being on the move. The 38-year-old is a wife and mom to three young daughters who are active in their Northeast Florida community and have a passion for being outdoors.</p>



<p>After working out at her gym one day, Lorie began to feel pain in her back and shoulder. When it became uncomfortable to sit or lay down, and she noticed exhaustion and difficulty sleeping, Lorie went to her local physician for answers.</p>

<p>"My first thought when they told me that I had cancer was: I have three little girls," says Lorie. "I can't have cancer. I have three little girls."</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20352489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor</a> had destroyed multiple areas of bone, including 25% of her T5 vertebrae and nearly 80% at T8. The result was a pathologic fracture with angulation of the spine, which put her at risk of a spinal cord injury and potential paralysis.</p>



<p>Lorie’s care was transferred to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, where a multidisciplinary team could coordinate her care.</p>



<p>"Once I reviewed her imaging, I had a discussion with Lorie and explained the precarious situation that she was in," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/buchanan-ian-a-m-d/bio-20521017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ian Buchanan</a>, a Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon. "We discussed with radiation and medical oncology teams, and we all agreed that we needed to proceed with surgery as the first step, with the explicit understanding being that she would need additional therapies, including radiation and chemotherapy."</p>



<p>Lorie's care team, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/starr-jason-s-d-o/bio-20439448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jason Starr</a>, a medical oncologist, began implementing the subsequent phases of treatment with insights from her surgery.</p>



<p>"Having the expertise and ability for one physician to pick up the phone, speak to an expert, and get real-time recommendations is unique to Mayo Clinic," says Dr. Starr.</p>

<p>"As physicians, we all go into this profession because we want to help people. An important part of helping patients is getting them back to a good quality of life," says Dr. Buchanan. "When you plan a surgery and interact with a patient, the goals of care have to align with what quality of life means for them."</p>



<p>For Lorie, quality of life means being there for her daughters — bringing them to school events and playing outdoors.</p>



<p>"I want my daughters to see me as their mom," says Lorie. "That was one of my promises to them: I'm still your mom, you're not losing me. I'm still here, I'll be OK. There are things that I have to do. There are doctor's appointments I have to go to. There are medicines that I'm going to have to take and therapies that I'm going to endure."</p>



<p>Lorie returned to the gym — building her strength — got back to playing with her daughters in the yard, and, over the summer, took her family on a kayaking adventure.</p>

<p>"Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of these research efforts so that we have better treatment options and patients can live better, longer, fulfilling lives," says Dr. Starr. "Lorie is doing all the heavy lifting, and we're cheering her on."</p>



<p>She is focused on her family and taking each day as it comes.</p>



<p>"For somebody with currently incurable cancer, it's nice to know that Mayo Clinic is working toward finding other treatments or a cure — that'd be nice," says Lorie. "Because every little girl needs her mama forever."</p>

<p>A team of researchers at Mayo Clinic has discovered that using fluorescent green dye combined with imaging during surgery for soft tissue sarcoma can help surgeons determine what tissue may be at risk of poor healing. This information allows surgeons to change the wound closure to reduce the risk of complications as the patient heals.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/soft-tissue-sarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20377725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soft tissue sarcoma</a>&nbsp;forms in tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures, including muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and the lining of joints. An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=The%20American%20Cancer%20Society's%20estimates,males%20and%206%2C000%20in%20females)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated 13,400 people</a>&nbsp;will be diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma in 2023.&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/fulltext/2021/08000/a_prospective_evaluation_of_intraoperative.7.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More than 30% of people</a>&nbsp;who receive radiation treatment before surgery to remove the cancer experience complications with their surgical wounds.</p>



<p>Patients receive the dye, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/indocyanine-green-interstitial-route-intradermal-route-intravenous-route/description/drg-20155722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indocyanine green</a>,  through an IV during surgery. When paired with imaging, the technology is called intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography. The technique allows surgeons to assess the amount of blood flowing in an area of tissue, called tissue perfusion. A lack of blood flow indicates a potential problem with tissue. Surgeons can then remove any tissue that lacks blood flow.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/monitor-632w-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379511" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/monitor-632w-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/monitor-632w.jpg 632w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Wound closure<br></strong>On the monitor, the surgeon views the incision during surgery. The white color indicates blood flowing to the tissue. If blood flow was insufficient, the monitor would show a dark spot.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"It basically changed our practice," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sherman-courtney-e-m-d/bio-20055611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Courtney Sherman, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic oncologist who led the research. "This technology gave us eyes beyond human eyes — a window into the blood supply to the patient's skin."</p>



<p>The team published its findings in the&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaos/fulltext/2021/05150/intraoperative_indocyanine_green_fluorescence.8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</a>&nbsp;(JAAOS) in May 2021 and in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/fulltext/2021/08000/a_prospective_evaluation_of_intraoperative.7.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Research and Reviews</a>&nbsp;in August 2021.</p>



<p>While the surgical technique isn’t yet in standard use for soft tissue sarcoma care across the U.S., surgeons caring for people with soft tissue sarcoma at Mayo Clinic now regularly use ICG fluorescence angiography.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How wound issues complicate healing for people with soft tissue sarcoma</h2>



<p>Soft tissue sarcoma often affects the arms and legs; surgery is a common treatment. The surgeon usually removes the cancer as well as some healthy tissue around it.</p>



<p>Patients typically receive radiation therapy to shrink the cancer before surgery, says Dr. Sherman. Orthopedic oncologists believe the combination of surgery and radiation&nbsp;<a href="https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7276567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increases the likelihood</a>&nbsp;that a surgeon can remove the cancer without needing to remove the entire limb.</p>



<p>Though modern radiation therapy is significantly more precise than in previous decades, it still may damage healthy cells along with cancer cells. This may lead to infection, or the radiation may destroy the genetic material in healthy cells and cut off blood supply. Over time, tissue that lacks blood supply dies, and the patient may require another surgery to remove this additional tissue.</p>



<p>Treatment for soft tissue sarcoma with radiation therapy followed by surgery has an infection risk of 38% for all patients. The risk of the surgical incision reopening in the same group is 42.3%, says Dr. Sherman.</p>



<p>"Wound healing issues disrupt the patient's treatment," says Dr. Sherman. "Due to wound complications, there has been a lot of 'back to the&nbsp;OR' for patients who have radiation therapy plus surgery for soft tissue sarcoma. It's a big deal if we can keep these patients out of the&nbsp;OR."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic’s research on ICG fluorescence</h2>



<p>In their&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaos/fulltext/2021/05150/intraoperative_indocyanine_green_fluorescence.8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 2021 JAAOS article</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers described their finding that&nbsp;ICG fluorescence&nbsp;angiography could not only predict wound complications for patients who had radiation therapy before surgery but also allow surgeons to make changes during the procedure to reduce the risk of complications. The 23-patient study found that intraoperative ICG fluorescence angiography could predict with a high degree of accuracy where complications with wound healing might occur, particularly for patients with soft tissue sarcoma in the lower extremities of the body (from the hip down).</p>



<p>For the&nbsp;AAOS&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/fulltext/2021/08000/a_prospective_evaluation_of_intraoperative.7.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Research and Reviews</a>&nbsp;article in August 2021, Dr. Sherman and the research team reported on a study conducted between October 2017 and September 2019 based on records for patients who received surgery for soft tissue sarcoma with ICG fluorescence angiography. The researchers compared these patients' experiences to those of patients who had received surgery without&nbsp;ICG&nbsp;fluorescence angiography. The study included 88 patients. Researchers found significantly lower rates of infection and surgical incisions reopening in patients who received ICG&nbsp;angiography compared with patients whose surgery did not include this technology.</p>



<p>"Using&nbsp;ICG&nbsp;green fluorescence is simple, straightforward and effective," says Dr. Sherman. “It’s making recovery less challenging for people with soft tissue sarcoma by reducing complications from surgery."</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;has advanced the development and biomanufacturing of novel therapeutics, called biologics, for cancer and inflammatory conditions into clinical trials.</p>



<p>"My dream has been to develop innovative technologies that go beyond treating symptoms to curing diseases. The ultimate aim is to ensure that these advancements are accessible to all patients in need," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, the Michael S. and Mary Sue Shannon Director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Dr. Allickson is also the Otto Bremer Trust Director, Biomanufacturing and Product Development, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Biomanufacturing uses living organisms to manufacture medicines known as biologics that are made from human sources such as blood and cells. Biologics have shown potential for targeted healing with few side effects.</p>



<p>The biomanufacturing process is like a bridge that moves biologics from the lab into first-in-human clinical trials. From there, Mayo Clinic aims to license these technologies to industry collaborators who can conduct clinical trials and commercialize them, thereby making them accessible to patients worldwide.</p>



<p>"To ensure broad access to new medicines, the most effective approach is to bring them to market," says Dr. Allickson. "We are evaluating the scientific rigor required to scale up the production of new drugs. Additionally, we are establishing a streamlined process for advanced biomanufacturing that incorporates automation. Our goal is to transfer production of the medicines to companies capable of replicating our manufacturing process. This will enable them to advance the technology toward obtaining regulatory approval."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Groundbreaking treatments for cancer</strong></h3>



<p>The Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics has reached several milestones in forwarding cutting edge cell therapies to early-stage clinical trials at Mayo Clinic, including:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing a Mayo Clinic-developed chimeric antigen therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</strong></h3>



<p>Chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/gnc-20405215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(CAR-T cell therapy)</a> is a regenerative immunotherapy in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to recognize and stop cancer. A new CAR-T cell therapy developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is aimed at B cell blood cancers that have returned and no longer respond to treatment. Mayo Clinic in Florida is preparing to biomanufacture this new cancer drug, known as BAFF-R, for a phase 1 clinical trial in early 2024. Dr. Qin is working on additional new CAR-T technologies for treating cancer.</p>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic we firmly believe that biomanufacturing CAR-T cell therapy on-site will expedite this lifesaving treatment to patients," says Dr. Allickson. "Backlogs can occur when cells are sent to an external manufacturer, causing delays that cancer patients can’t afford."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing an experimental cell-based ovarian cancer vaccine.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In this pioneering research led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/knutson-keith-l-ph-d/bio-00026672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keith Knutson, Ph.D.</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, white blood cells are extracted from blood, biomanufactured to become dendritic cells and returned to the patient. Dendritic cells act as crusaders that march through the body, triggering the immune system to halt disease progression. Manufacturing the cells at Mayo Clinic is critical so adjustments can be made for each patient's individual cancer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New biomanufacturing facilities open</strong></h3>



<p>Mayo Clinic is expanding the number of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) facilities needed to manufacture biologic therapies for clinical trials. CGMP facilities are clean rooms where therapeutic agents are manufactured in environments free of contamination and meet Food and Drug Administration specifications for safety, identity, strength, purity and quality.</p>



<p>Three new clean rooms opened recently in Florida. A new CGMP facility in One Discovery Square in Rochester, Minn., is ready to begin operations. Mayo Clinic in Arizona is taking an innovative approach of setting up CGMP clean rooms for 3D printing and 3D bioprinting. Mayo Clinic is among the first academic medical centers to 3D bioprint living cells, bones, or organs.</p>



<p>"What differentiates Mayo Clinic is its ability to 3D bioprint cells with CGMP bioprinters in a CGMP-compliant clean room," says Dr. Allickson. "This unique ability distinguishes us as a leader in this field for which we are gaining increasing recognition for our expertise."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A look ahead to 2024</strong></h2>



<p>The Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics has advanced several cell-based therapies to the process and analytical development stage in preparation for biomanufacturing in 2024. Process development establishes standard operating procedures for manufacturing to ensure an experimental therapy is safe and of consistent quality for testing on humans in clinical trials.</p>



<p>Technologies in process development include:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oncolytic virus for a two-pronged attack on cancer</strong></h3>



<p>The team of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vile-richard-g-ph-d/bio-00027663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Vile, Ph.D</a>., is developing genetically engineered viruses with potential to not only destroy cancer, but also trigger an immune response for a second wave of cancer destruction. This technology, known as oncolytic virus, will be combined with CAR-T cell therapy&nbsp;to target solid tumors in patients with liver cancer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Immune cells to address inflammatory conditions</strong></h3>



<p>Supported by a grant from the Skoll Foundation, researchers are studying immune cells to address inflammatory conditions. They are investigating whether these cells and their secretomes could be possible treatments for inflammatory conditions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lupus/symptoms-causes/syc-20365789" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lupus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. Immune cells defend the body against infection. Secretomes are the healing properties released by cells.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CAR-T cell therapy targeting thyroid cancer, graft-versus-host disease and inflammatory bowel disease</strong></h3>



<p>Groundbreaking technology developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, would expand CAR-T cell therapy beyond blood cancers to solid tumors. This discovery targets thyroid hormone stimulating receptor (TSHR) found on the surface of thyroid cancer tumors. Also in process development is a unique CAR-T cell therapy from Dr. Kenderian' s lab developed from mesenchymal stem cells. It will initially treat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/videos/graft-vs-host-disease-gvhd-mayo-clinic/vid-20433405#:~:text=Marrow%20Transplant%20Division.-,Graft%20vs.,and%20they%20reject%20your%20body." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graft-versus-host disease</a>, a rare complication from a bone marrow transplant, and inflammatory bowel disease.</p>



<p>Dr. Allickson sees an exciting year ahead that will include research and development of Regulatory T-cells, often called "Tregs."&nbsp; Tregs play a critical role in regulating the immune system. They show potential for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colitis</a>&nbsp;in which the body mistakenly attacks healthy cells.</p>



<p>"It's a privilege and an honor to be at Mayo Clinic where we can research and develop promising long-term or permanent solutions for patients with rare and complex disease," says Dr. Allickson.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic researchers make new discoveries, develop first-of-its-kind tools and technologies and constantly improve upon existing ones with the goal to provide the best in healthcare. The following five stories are a round-up of some of the most significant medical research advances at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> over the past year. Discoveries range from harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to detect disease sooner to advancing treatments for rare and complex diseases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/10/11/advancing-ultrasound-microvessel-imaging-and-ai-to-improve-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advancing ultrasound microvessel imaging and AI to improve cancer detection</a></h2>



<p>Tumors consist not only of cancer cells but also a matrix of small blood vessels, or microvessels, that cannot be seen in the images produced by conventional ultrasound machines. To solve this problem, physician-scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/alizad-azra-m-d/bio-00085586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azra Alizad, M.D.</a>, and biomedical engineering scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fatemi-mostafa-ph-d/bio-00086282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostafa Fatemi, Ph.D.</a>, teamed up at Mayo Clinic to design and study a tool that may improve the resolution of ultrasound imaging. As demonstrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, they developed high-resolution ultrasound imaging software, compatible with many ultrasound machines, that could exponentially improve both the detail and quality of images. See the animation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCtLfFbWcEo&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>"If we can visualize and capture the microvessel in the earliest stages of cancer, we can better diagnose and treat it earlier, which improves the outcome for the patient," says Dr. Alizad, who specializes in ultrasound technology for cancer imaging.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/10/11/advancing-ultrasound-microvessel-imaging-and-ai-to-improve-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/19/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-ovarian-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harnessing the immune system to fight ovarian cancer</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic research is biomanufacturing an experimental, cell-based ovarian cancer vaccine and combining it with immunotherapy to study a "one-two punch" approach to halting disease progression in ovarian cancer patients. This research begins with a blood draw from women with advanced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>&nbsp;whose tumors have returned after standard surgery and chemotherapy. White blood cells are extracted from the blood, biomanufactured to become dendritic cells and are returned to the patient. Dendritic cells act as crusaders that march through the body, triggering the immune system to recognize and fight cancer.</p>



<p>"We're building on an earlier phase 1 clinical trial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18962-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that showed promising results</a>&nbsp;in terms of survival after the dendritic cell-based vaccine," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, co-principal investigator and medical oncologist. "Of the 18 evaluable patients in the phase 1 study, 11 had cancer return, but seven of them — 40%&nbsp;— have been cancer-free for almost 10 years. We typically expect 90% of patients in this condition to have the cancer return."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/19/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-ovarian-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic research has developed a new type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</a>&nbsp;aimed at killing B-cell blood cancers that have returned and are no longer responding to treatment. This pioneering technology, designed and developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, killed B-cell tumors grown in the laboratory and tumors implanted in mouse models. The preclinical findings are published in&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00262-023-03537-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy</a>.</p>



<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/11/mayo-clinic-prepares-to-biomanufacture-a-new-car-t-cell-therapy-for-b-cell-blood-cancers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Colonoscopy remains the gold standard in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer. But the procedure has limitations. Some studies suggest that&nbsp;more than half&nbsp;of post-colonoscopy colon cancer cases arise from lesions that were missed at patients’ previous colonoscopies.</p>



<p>"AI, particularly the subset of AI called computer vision, is naturally suited to what we do through the endoscope," says Michael B. Wallace, M.D., who describes himself as a bit of a technology geek.</p>



<p>In 2022, Dr. Wallace&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35304117/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published the results</a>&nbsp;of an international, multicenter study testing the impact of adding AI to routine colonoscopies. His team, which included James East, M.D., a gastroenterologist at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London</a>, as well as researchers from the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Germany and Ireland, found that incorporating AI into colonoscopies reduced the risk of missing polyps by 50%.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/02/03/artificial-intelligence-is-forging-a-new-future-for-gastroenterology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;researchers uncover evidence supporting a shorter treatment time for breast cancer patients in a randomized trial, published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(23)00388-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Oncology</a>. The study compared two separate dosing schedules of pencil-beam scanning proton therapy, the most advanced type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/proton-therapy/about/pac-20384758?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proton therapy</a>&nbsp;known for its precision in targeting cancer cells while preserving healthy tissue to reduce the risk of side effects.</p>



<p>"The study provides the first prospective data supporting the use of shorter-course proton PMRT, including in patients with immediate breast reconstruction, and the first mature results of a randomized trial in the field of breast particle therapy," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mutter-robert-w-m-d/bio-20343551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Mutter, M.D.</a>, a radiation oncologist and physician-scientist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "We can now consider the option of 15 days of therapy with patients based on the similar treatment outcomes observed as the longer conventional course. Of note, the short course actually resulted in reduced skin side effects during and after treatment."&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-mayo-clinic-study-reveals-proton-beam-therapy-may-shorten-breast-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Doctors often use radiation to target cancer cells, but did you know radiation therapy can also provide relief from pain?</p>



<p>"Radiation therapy is typically used in about 50% to 60% of all cancer patients, it's very, very common,” says Dr. Holtzman.</p>



<p>He says high-powered energy eradicates cancer cells, shrinking the tumors and helping to ease agonizing aches.</p>



<p>"Typically, 60% to 80% of patients usually have partial or even complete relief of their pain in two to four weeks,” says Dr. Holtzman.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/01/a-medical-illustration-of-radiation-therapy-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of radiation therapy" class="wp-image-182448" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/01/a-medical-illustration-of-radiation-therapy-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/01/a-medical-illustration-of-radiation-therapy-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<p>Mayo Clinic is using innovation to streamline the process. Even before patients walk through the door, they undergo a virtual planning scan that was created from a prior CT.</p>



<p>"What that means is patients using a diagnostic scan that was previously obtained, we map out the radiation plan, so we can deliver it quicker and more efficiently to maximize that patient's time and quality of life,” explains Dr. Holtzman.</p>

<p>The holidays are a joyous occasion for most people.

And as family and friends get together, it's important to show that you care without coming across as insensitive.</p>



<p>Lynne Vitagliano, a clinical social worker at Mayo Clinic, offers some helpful advice to make those uncomfortable conversations less awkward.</p>

<p>Many times, people mean well but don't know the right things to say to someone with cancer.</p>



<p>"Every person is different. So it would be hard to say that there's any one right question to ask or right thing to say. What I think is most important is to convey genuine care and concern," says Vitagliano. "Offer an invitation rather than a question. So to say something along the lines of, 'I've been thinking of you. I know a lot is going on in your life. I'm here if you'd like to talk.'"</p>



<p>Vitagliano says it's also important how you respond. And the best response is simply listening.</p>



<p>"Allow them to talk about their experience without feeling the need to kind of jump in with your own advice or suggestions," she says.</p>



<p>And it's important to show that you care without coming across as insensitive.</p>



<p>"We want to say something that we think is supportive. So we say, 'I'm sure it'll all turn out OK.' Well, we don't know that, and that's not necessarily true. And so, by saying that, it almost invalidates what they've shared with us," Vitagliano says. "It's not as supportive as saying, 'Wow, you've been through so much this year. And I'm just blown away by your strength. What can I do to help?'"</p>

<p>How cancer spreads or metastasizes is a big question for cancer researchers and patients. Mayo Clinic researchers studying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic cancer</a>&nbsp;— the third deadliest form of cancer in the U.S. — recently made a discovery that advances knowledge of how metastasis unfolds. They identified a cell-signaling protein that drives pancreatic cancer cell growth that could be a potential therapeutic target.</p>



<p>"Our ultimate goal is to find the triggers for metastasis and stop it. Combine that with treatments to reduce tumor growth, and we can hopefully improve patient outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/razidlo-gina-ph-d/bio-00096936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gina Razidlo, Ph.D.</a>, the senior author of a paper published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(23)01053-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cell Reports</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking inside the tumor microenvironment</strong></h2>



<p>Tumors grow in nutrient-poor environments, so cancer cells must rewire cellular metabolism to meet their energy needs. One way in which cancer cells hijack metabolic pathways is through lysosomes, which function as the cell's stomach and are filled with digestive enzymes. Lysosomes break down proteins, lipids and nutrients that fuel cells to grow. Previous research has shown that amplified lysosome activity is a hallmark of various forms of cancer.</p>



<p>This knowledge led Dr. Razidlo and lead author Omar Gutierrez Ruiz, Ph.D., to look closely at the characteristics of lysosomes in pancreatic cancer cells driven by mutations in the cancer-producing mutated gene, or oncogene, KRAS. Dr. Gutierrez Ruiz collaborated with the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/core-resources/proteomics-core/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proteomics Core</a> on this project as part of his dissertation, and together, they made an unexpected discovery.</p>

<p>They compared the lysosomes from pancreatic cancer cells expressing oncogenic KRAS with lysosomes from cells with healthy KRAS to find out what was different. Among the 52 proteins they found that had changed on the surface of lysosomes in pancreatic cancer cells, one protein called dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) stood out.</p>



<p>DOCK8 creates invasive protrusions that act like little arms that can worm through and change the structure of a cell and degrade its surroundings. DOCK8 is typically found in healthy immune cells where it helps the cells navigate and squeeze through dense tissue, aiding the response to and fight against infection. Surprisingly, Dr. Razidlo, Dr. Gutierrez Ruiz and their collaborators found DOCK8 on lysosomes in pancreatic cancer cells.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does DOCK8 work?</strong></h2>



<p>How cancer cells invade and spread resembles how DOCK8 helps immune cells penetrate tissue. The researchers looked at images and videos of the pancreatic cancer cells, produced in Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-cell-signaling-gastroenterology-c-sig/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Cell Signaling in Gastroenterology</a>. They saw DOCK8 using lysosomes to break down the extracellular environment around the cancer cell — helping it spread.</p>



<p>To confirm that this protein is involved in tumor progression, the team eliminated DOCK8 in pancreatic cancer cells using the gene-editing tool CRISPR. They found in a preclinical model that the DOCK8-depleted lysosomes moved slower, tumor growth slowed and metastasis decreased. Then, they delved further and showed that DOCK8 was present in about 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer whose cells were studied.</p>



<p>"Now that we have found out that DOCK8 is regulating the process of metastasis, it could potentially be a therapeutic target to prevent or stop pancreatic cancer metastasis," says Dr. Gutierrez Ruiz, who graduated from&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>&nbsp;in May.</p>
