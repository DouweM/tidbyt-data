<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:00) is in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/SCRIPT-MCM-3-tips-from-Mayo-Clinic-dietitian-about-holiday-indulgence17.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>However you celebrate the holidays, there is likely to be an excess of food at your fingertips. And that usually means lots of sugar and perhaps alcohol.</p>



<p>Delgado says you can manage indulgences during the holidays with these three tips.</p>



<p>"No. 1: Don't choose to go on a diet right before the holidays," she says.</p>



<p>Instead, pay attention to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how much</a>&nbsp;and how often you're eating.</p>



<p>"No. 2: Don't beat yourself up. If you do overindulge, it's OK to make a plan moving forward at the next party, at the next gathering," says Delgado.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Allow yourself to choose different items and portion sizes next time. What you drink matters too.</p>

<p>"No. 3: Stay hydrated. Oftentimes what we neglect most is staying hydrated, and we choose sugary beverages or alcohol, which can add a lot of added calories, empty calories that we can save by drinking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water</a>," she says.</p>



<p>Water should be your main beverage every day, including the holidays</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">More strategies to manage holiday indulgences</h3>



<p><strong>Prioritize physical activity:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Keep physical activity as a priority, even during busy holiday seasons.</li>



<li>Consider morning walks or light exercises before celebrations.</li>



<li>Enjoy the festivities without compromising your health.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Plan ahead for food choices:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Eat something healthy before attending parties to avoid extreme hunger.</li>



<li>Opt for fruits and nuts to curb cravings.</li>



<li>Decide in advance what you'll eat, and focus on healthier options.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Mindful alcohol consumption:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Alcoholic drinks contribute calories and increase hunger.</li>



<li>Alternate alcoholic beverages with low-calorie options, such as carbonated water.</li>



<li>Be mindful of your alcohol intake.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Self-compassion matters:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Don't give up or feel unhappy about managing weight during the holidays.</li>



<li>Be kind to yourself and enjoy the season with a little effort.</li>
</ul>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. – Tis the season of a million errands and shopping trips, and it just so happens to coincide with that time of year when ice and snow begin to impact travel, both in our cars and on foot.</p>



<p>In the north country, a good pair of boots isn't always enough to protect your feet and ankles from injury if you're not careful. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that about 1 million adults in the U.S. are injured due to slips and falls every year, with the injury rate increasing significantly as temperatures decline.</p>



<p>"When it comes to slippery sidewalks and roads, vigilance truly is key," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/taylor-beahrs-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Beahrs, M.D.</a>, an orthopedic surgeon at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato">Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato</a>. "This can be especially true for adults with balance problems, or those who have ankle pain or instability."</p>



<p>So what can you do? Dr. Beahrs recommends the following tips while out running around on the snow and ice.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wear proper footwear.</strong><br>Be sure you have a pair of lightweight boots with good support. You also can purchase snow grips or ice cleats for the bottoms of your shoes or boots for just a few dollars.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Take your time.</strong><br>Do not hurry while walking outside. Pay attention to your steps and walk slowly.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Use assistance.</strong><br>Always use handrails, a walking stick, your walker or cane when out in winter weather.<br><br></li>



<li><strong>Take small steps.</strong><br>Small steps, almost from side to side, help you maintain your center of gravity. Take small steps and waddle a bit like a penguin.<br><br></li>



<li><strong>Stay inside.</strong><br>On days when it is icy and you do not need to go anywhere, stay home.<br><br></li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. Beahrs also recommends that if you do feel yourself falling and cannot regain your balance, don't try to brace your landing with an outstretched arm. That can lead to more injuries. Try to land on your buttock or back.</p>



<p>After a fall, wait for someone to help you in case you are injured or to avoid subsequent falls. Some people further injure themselves by springing up after a fall instead of waiting for help.</p>



<p>"Overall, just use your best judgment on the snow and ice, and take time to assess your path forward before taking steps," says Dr. Beahrs.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>We're thinking about getting a dog. We know they're great companions, but how are they good for your health?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>People with dogs know the benefits of pet ownership. The unconditional love, trust and loyalty shown by your canine companions, coupled with their unbridled enthusiasm on your return home each day, is hard to put into words.</p>



<p>There's another plus of having a dog by your side: It improves your overall physical and mental health. Here's how.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dogs get you moving</strong></h2>



<p>A notable benefit is that dogs force you to get up and move. One research study found that dog owners are more likely to report regular physical activity than people who don't own dogs.</p>



<p>Activities associated with dog ownership, like feeding, grooming, playing and letting them outside, all increase physical activity levels. Physical activity improves blood flow, induces muscle contraction and reduces joint stiffness.</p>



<p>Dogs also require regular exercise and will greet it with smiles and wagging tails. In addition to a typical walk, you can work hiking and running into your outings with your dog depending on its breed. People who regularly perform <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/aerobic-exercise/hlv-20049447">aerobic exercise</a> have improved blood pressure, reduced blood sugar levels, better-controlled weight and a reduced risk of developing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">cardiovascular disease</a>. Other studies have demonstrated that exercise can improve depression and anxiety.</p>



<p>Over time, exercise will help strengthen your muscles, bones and joints. You may notice that your usual route is feeling easier so you decide to stay out longer or walk up that extra hill.</p>



<p>When selecting a new puppy or dog, carefully consider its energy leels and exercise requirements. It's best when your lifestyle and activity levels match that of your canine buddy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dogs help your weight</strong></h2>



<p>Exercise burns calories and helps you maintain a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/healthy-weight">healthy weight</a>. In one&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/your-hearts-best-friend-dog-ownership-associated-with-better-cardiovascular-health/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721">study</a>, adults who regularly walked their dogs were less likely to be obese than their nondog-owning neighbors. The same research found that dog owners also are more likely to report a healthy diet and blood sugar at ideal levels, which improves overall heart health. Walking for 30 minutes a day will reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, colon and breast cancer, and Type 2 diabetes.</p>



<p>That 30 minutes of light-to-moderate dog walking also can help you&nbsp;achieve deeper, more <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ways-to-get-better-sleep">restful sleep</a>. Healthcare professionals recommend adults aim for 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week.</p>



<p>One way to get walking with your new dog is to start a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/get-walking-with-this-12-week-walking-schedule/">12-week walking schedule</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dogs promote social connection</strong></h2>



<p>Owning a dog has been linked to better mental health and a lower perception of social isolation, which can reduce the risk of heart attacks and cognitive issues. Being socially isolated is a strong risk factor for worse health outcomes and premature death. Dog owners interact more with other people, such as other dog owners and people they encounter on walks, and are less likely to experience depression.</p>



<p>Consider training your dog for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/a-day-in-the-life-of-luna-a-facility-dog">pet therapy</a>&nbsp;to gain the dual benefits of connection and volunteering.</p>



<p>For people who work from home, there are four significant ways pets can help with your mental health:</p>

<li><strong>Reducing work-related&nbsp;stress.</strong><br>Two out of 3 employees say work&nbsp;stresses&nbsp;them out, and 40% say their job gets in the way of their health.

<li><strong>Managing anxiety.<br></strong>With the increase in work-from-home jobs, more people are struggling with mental health. Pets can provide the companionship and support once found in the office.</li>



<li><strong>Increasing activity.</strong><br>Dogs give you a reason to go outside, breathe in fresh air and get some physical activity.</li>



<li><strong>Combating&nbsp;loneliness.</strong><br>The bond with pets helps people&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/brushing-off-the-social-rust">feel less alone</a>.

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart failure is a potentially urgent health concern for young <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-congenital-heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355456?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adults with congenital heart disease</a> (ACHD) that is often overlooked and undertreated, even as hospitalizations for this condition continue to rise. New research from Mayo Clinic shows that young adults in the U.S. living with congenital heart disease are at an increased risk of death or cardiovascular complications after being hospitalized for heart failure. However, study data published in the <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Heart Association</a> also found that patients who had been receiving recent cardiology care before a heart failure hospitalization were less likely to die.</p>



<p>"More than 85% of children born with congenital heart disease reach adulthood. They are likely to experience complications later, yet 61% of these patients beyond the age of 18 do not see a cardiology specialist," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/medical-innovation/burchill-congenital-heart-disease?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke Burchill, M.B.B.S., Ph.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. "These young adult patients have a strong need for individualized care pathways to improve their quality of life and monitor health issues like heart failure."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.118.008775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prior research</a> showed that heart failure hospitalizations of U.S. adults with congenital heart disease increased dramatically from 1998 to 2011. To further understand this trend and its effect on patients and hospital resources, Dr. Burchill and colleagues used national data to study a retrospective cohort of adults with congenital heart disease hospitalized in the past decade. The percentage of ACHD heart failure hospitalizations increased significantly, rising from 6.6% in 2010 to 14% in 2020.</p>



<p>In more than 26,000 unique hospital admissions of ACHD patients, 22% had heart failure and 78% did not. Those admitted with heart failure had a higher risk of death and other major heart and brain complications and used more healthcare resources, including rehospitalization and post-acute care services than those admitted without heart failure. However, people who had a cardiology clinic visit within 30 days prior to hospital admission had lower rates of death due to any causes at the 90-day and 1-year mark.</p>



<p>The ACHD patients with heart failure were nearly twice as likely as those without heart failure to be readmitted to a hospital, especially those under age 45, regardless of their type of congenital heart disease. Younger patients also required more medical or supportive care after they left the hospital before they could return home and care for themselves.</p>



<p>"Many of the patients I meet with ACHD and heart failure share a similar story of not having their heart-related symptoms taken seriously, leading to a delayed recognition and treatment of heart failure. The good news is that we can reset the course for most," says Dr. Burchill. "We have new medications to restrengthen the heart, new options for replacing heart valves without opening the chest, and low-risk treatments for returning heart rhythm to normal. Our goal is to shift the focus from heart failure to heart function and patient success in feeling better and living longer."</p>

<p>A salmonella outbreak in North America is being linked to cantaloupe, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/sundsvall-11-23/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/salmonella/symptoms-causes/syc-20355329?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salmonella infection, or salmonellosis,</a>&nbsp;is a common bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through feces. Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food.</p>



<p>Typically, people with&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-recognize-symptoms-of-salmonella-infection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">salmonella infection</a>&nbsp;have no symptoms. Others develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within eight to 72 hours. Most healthy people recover within a few days without specific treatment.</p>



<p>In some cases, diarrhea associated with salmonella infection can be so dehydrating that it requires prompt medical attention. Life-threatening complications also can develop if the infection spreads beyond your intestines. Your risk of acquiring salmonella infection is higher if you travel to countries with poor sanitation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of salmonella infection</h3>



<p>Most salmonella infections can be classified as&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-to-do-when-sick-with-norovirus-or-stomach-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stomach flu</a>, or gastroenteritis. The incubation period ranges from several hours to two days.</p>



<p>Possible signs and symptoms of salmonella infection include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nausea</li>



<li>Vomiting</li>



<li>Abdominal cramps</li>



<li>Diarrhea</li>



<li>Fever</li>



<li>Chills</li>



<li>Headache</li>



<li>Blood in the stool</li>
</ul>



<p>The symptoms generally last two to seven days. Diarrhea can last up to 10 days, although it may take several months before bowels return to normal.</p>



<p>A few varieties of salmonella bacteria can cause typhoid fever, a sometimes deadly disease that is more common in developing countries.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Causes of salmonella infection</h3>



<p>Salmonella bacteria live in the intestines of people, animals and birds. Most people are infected with salmonella by eating foods that have been contaminated by feces.</p>



<p>Commonly infected foods include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Raw meat, poultry and seafood</strong><br>Feces may get onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process. Seafood may be contaminated if harvested from contaminated water.</li>



<li><strong>Raw eggs</strong><br>While an egg's shell may seem to be a perfect barrier to contamination, some infected chickens produce eggs that contain salmonella before the shell is even formed. Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.</li>



<li><strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong><br>Some fresh produce, particularly imported varieties, may be hydrated in the field or washed during processing with water contaminated with salmonella. Contamination also can occur in the kitchen, when juices from raw meat and poultry come into contact with uncooked foods, such as salads.</li>

<p>"What happens in&nbsp;Dupuytren's&nbsp;disease is the layer of fascia that&nbsp;is underneath&nbsp;the skin in the palm gets thickened and contracted," says Dr. Noland.</p>



<p>That can make your fingers curl in. It's not painful, but Dr. Noland says, "It can cause significant functional limitations because the patients are unable to fully straighten out their fingers."</p>

<p>Dupuytren contracture is a condition that causes one or more fingers to bend toward the palm of the hand. The affected fingers can't straighten completely. It most often affects the two fingers farthest from the thumb.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Patients with advanced disease&nbsp;will need an intervention to relieve the contracture. There are several treatment options. An enzyme injection is a newer, less invasive treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It actually dissolves the thickened Palmer cords and fascia allowing the fingers to straighten," she says.</p>



<p>So how do you know if you need to see a specialist for your condition? Here's a tabletop test. </p>



<p>As Dr. Noland explains, "Lay your hand flat on the table. If you're able to lay it flat, then you probably will not require any intervention. But if you're unable to lay it flat because of the contractures in the fingers, then you would want to seek care with a hand surgeon <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dupuytrens-contracture/doctors-departments/ddc-20371950?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specializing</a> in&nbsp;Dupuytren's&nbsp;disease."</p>

<p>LA CROSSE, Wis. – <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/staying-safe-in-your-tree-stand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tree stand accidents</a>, <a href="https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/featured-stories/hunting-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firearm injuries</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/in-depth/heart-attack-symptoms/art-20047744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart issues</a> are the more high-profile injuries reported during deer hunting season. But some of the most common injuries occur before or after the hunt is over. Foot and ankle sprains, fractured ankles, ruptured Achilles tendons, and sore or overused muscles in the shoulders, arms and legs might have prolonged health ramifications.</p>



<p>"Oftentimes when we go out hunting, due to a lack of physical fitness, we overexert ourselves more than we're normally used to," says Katie McCabe, occupational therapist and ergonomics specialist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse</a>. "With that, we need to think about our safety as we manage our deer in the woods, whether it's a buck or a doe."</p>



<p>Once hunters have targeted and culminated in harvesting the deer, the task now becomes getting the deer back to the cabin or vehicle.  That’s when the fun might be over, and the hard work begins.</p>



<p>"I advocate the power position or tug-of-war position. We need to keep our head over our shoulders and always keep our arms close to our bodies," McCabe explains. "Anytime our arms are out away from us, it's going to be a lot more demanding, and we're going to have to use smaller muscles to do the work. That power position with a staggered stance allows the bigger, stronger muscles, such as our legs, to do the work. Just remember, with that power position, we want to keep our spine in neutral so we're maintaining &nbsp;the natural curves of the spine If we lose those curves, a lot more is demanded across our whole body."</p>



<p>She says the best-case scenario is to get a deer out of the woods going downhill. But you can have other things with you to get that deer to where you need to take it.</p>



<p>"For example, have along a deer-dragging harness. Those allow you to propel in a push motion while dragging the deer. If you don’t have one, bring a rope and find a tree limb. Tie the rope to the deer and limb, and with the limb in front of you, push using the power position. Also, we can have the rope over our shoulder or in front of our waist. This allows pushing the deer as opposed to pulling the deer having an arm behind our body, which might lead to fatigue and discomfort," says McCabe.</p>



<p>McCabe, a deer hunter herself, says hunters often may experience some low back fatigue and discomfort and potentially even shoulder and neck injuries, depending on their posture and how they exert themselves.</p>



<p>"Everyone's going to know their body the best and how their body responds to some overexertion," explains McCabe. "It's not a bad idea to stretch before you head out to the woods or hike out to the tree stand. All of our work is in front of our bodies. Try incorporating some stretching in opposite positions or opposite postures. Shoulder circles backwards and hamstring stretches can be easily done. Try and make the good choices of adding Gatorade or water so muscles and your whole body remain hydrated."</p>



<p>Whether or not you're hunting alone or with a party, it's always good to have a plan.</p>



<p>"Communicate that plan with your group, or maybe family or friends at home, regarding a timeline on your goals on when you want to go out and when you expect to be back. Let them know where your starting point will be. Always have a cellphone or a walkie-talkie available even if cellphone reception might be hit or miss. At least the hunting party knows where to find you just in case," says McCabe.</p>



<p>In 2019, over 15 million people paid for hunting licenses across the U.S. </p>

<p>During Thanksgiving, food often takes center stage at gatherings of friends and family. The focus is on turkey, pie and all the sides. But it also can challenge healthy eating habits.</p>



<p>Andrea Delgado, a Mayo Clinic dietitian, says that by paying attention to how much you eat and how often, you can make <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20047702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy food</a> choices during the holidays.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:01) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."

<p>Sit down. Enjoy your holiday meal, says Delgado.</p>



<p>"There's never an all-or-nothing approach in nutrition, you can still enjoy everything in moderation," she says.</p>



<p>Delgado says overindulging during the holidays can be a tipping point for some.</p>



<p>"Maybe now we have a new diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high cholesterol</a> or a new diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prediabetes</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> because, even though we only did it for a short period of time, it was enough that we were close enough to be diagnosed with these new conditions," she says.</p>



<p>One strategy includes weighing your options and making choices.</p>



<p>"Let's say I have a green bean casserole, which is filled with cream of mushroom and a lot of other ingredients, versus just a side of green beans. Your better option would be the green beans," she says.</p>

<p>But what about that pumpkin pie?</p>



<p>"We can still have a small wedge, but maybe we don't add the whipped topping or the additional toppings that we might add typically. It's not really cutting out entire foods. It's more how can we reduce the portion or what we add to those foods," says Delgado.</p>

The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 vaccine</a> is strongly recommended for people who face the highest risk of experiencing complications from the virus. This group includes older people, those with compromised immune systems and chronic medical conditions such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, and very young children. If you're young and healthy, the vaccine may not benefit you as much, but you still should consider getting it if you live with someone in one of these categories or want to reduce the risk of a COVID-19 infection.</p>



<p>Overall, there is little to no harm in getting the vaccine for protection. For most of the population, the risks from the vaccine are much less significant than the risks from COVID-19 itself. While getting the vaccine does not prevent all COVID-19 cases, the latest vaccines aim to reduce the number of hospitalizations, severe illnesses and deaths from the virus.</p>



<p>Even if you have had COVID-19 previously or have been vaccinated, it is important to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine because the immunity from previous vaccines and infections decreases over time. Another benefit has to do with immune innovation — when the virus changes, it can escape the antibodies you’ve formed in reaction to the previous versions of the vaccine. By getting the updated vaccine, you are protecting yourself against the strains that are currently circulating.</p>



<p>The 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer target a different strain of COVID-19 than was in the original vaccine. Think <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a> vaccines — they are all flu vaccines, but the strains they protect against change year after year.</p>



<p>The updated vaccine targets the XBB.1.5 strain that has been circulating throughout the U.S. and most parts of the world since the start of 2023. The World Health Organization has labeled XBB.1.5 as the most transmissible omicron strain to date.</p>



<p>The updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine is the only COVID-19 vaccine currently available. Essentially, with the approval of the new vaccine, the older vaccines have lost their approval.</p>



<p>Other methods to protect yourself from COVID-19 include getting enough sleep and exercise. Avoid highly crowded indoor spaces and consider wearing a mask when you cannot avoid those situations. If you become sick, wear a mask to protect those around you and stay home to avoid exposing people at your workplace and elsewhere.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 vaccine and the influenza vaccine can be given at the same time. Keep in mind that there is no way to tell the difference between flu, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cold</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/respiratory-syncytial-virus/symptoms-causes/syc-20353098?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</a> or COVID-19 symptoms besides testing.</p>

<p>"Our goal is to transform the transplant practice for future patients. To do that, we are using technology and team science to look at ways to optimize donated organs, liberate patients from anti-rejection medications and enable donated organs to last longer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burcin Taner, M.D.</a>, director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Florida.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is celebrating the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of its first organ transplant, which was a kidney transplant from a living donor on Nov. 25, 1963. Today, Mayo Clinic is the largest integrated transplant center in the U.S. Mayo Clinic's transplant centers in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota combined have performed over 31,000 organ transplants.</p>

<p>"From the very beginning, organ transplantation has been exciting because it can allow a patient who has end-stage organ failure and who is extremely ill and suffering to get back to a normal life. We need to achieve that for more patients," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heimbach-julie-k-m-d/bio-20054676?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Heimbach, M.D.</a>, director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Minnesota.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Here are four promising ways transplant is changing:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Enabling more donated organs to be safely used.</strong></h2>



<p>New technology is helping ensure that more donated organs can get to the people who desperately need them. One of the biggest advances has been organ-perfusion systems. These mechanical devices enable donated organs such as lungs, hearts, kidneys and livers to remain viable outside the body for a longer period of time so that they can be used. It also allows surgeons to restore organs that would otherwise not be safe for transplantation. "Organ perfusion technology has helped us expand the donor pool and deliver lifesaving transplants to more and more patients, all while maintaining some of the best outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bashar Aqel, M.D., </a>&nbsp;director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Helping transplants last longer.</strong></h2>



<p>The average kidney transplant in the U.S. lasts 10 to 20 years, meaning transplant recipients are often faced with needing a second transplant. But what if those donated organs could last longer? Researchers are looking at ways to keep patients healthier so that these donated organs thrive longer. For example, one of the most common causes of kidney failure is diabetes, which is related to obesity. One innovative approach is to perform bariatric surgery ahead of the kidney transplant to reduce the chance of post-transplant diabetes. Efforts are also underway to improve how organs are matched with patients with the goal of minimizing the need for immunosuppression medication, which can have negative side effects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Identifying organ failure earlier.</strong></h2>



<p>The quicker someone is identified as being at risk for organ failure, the sooner they can begin to receive treatment in hopes of delaying — and potentially preventing — the need for a transplant. Researchers are exploring ways to identify subtle warning signs that this is happening earlier via artificial intelligence and biomarkers in the blood.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Bioengineering new organs.</strong></h2>



<p>It may sound like science fiction, but experts hope that one day there will be a way to engineer new organs using <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative medicine</a>. That would eliminate the uncertainty of organ donation and long waiting lists. Those efforts are still in the early stages.</p>



<p>While all of these potential advances offer hope, choosing to be an organ donor is a step people can take today to help save more lives. More than 103,000 people are on the waiting list in the U.S. for a transplant, according to the <a href="https://unos.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing</a>. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/living-donor-transplantation/overview/ovc-20545462?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Living donation</a> allows people to donate a kidney or part of their liver to someone in need. People also can <a href="https://donatelife.net/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">register</a> to become a deceased donor.</p>
