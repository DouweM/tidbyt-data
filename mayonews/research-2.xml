<p>More than 60 years ago, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5480854/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pioneering researcher</a> showed how a pulse of electricity to a charging bull's brain could be used to stop the animal in its tracks. Today, neurostimulation is used to treat a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24330698/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">variety of human disorders</a>, including Parkinson's disease, tremor, obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette syndrome. A Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon and his colleagues believe one form of that treatment, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep brain stimulation (DBS)</a>, is poised to solve one of the greatest public health challenges: drug addiction.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="597" height="398" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Kendall-Lee.jpg" alt="Image of Kendall Lee, M.D., Ph.D." class="wp-image-382295" style="width:313px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Kendall-Lee.jpg 597w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Kendall-Lee-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kendall Lee, M.D., Ph.D., has advanced DBS, a neurosurgical procedure that uses implanted electrodes and electrical stimulation to treat movement disorders and psychiatric conditions.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Drug addiction is a huge, unmet medical need," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lee-kendall-h-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendall Lee, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, who has published nearly 100 journal articles on DBS along with his colleagues. Key to treating it, he says, is cutting off the pleasurable "high" that comes with the addiction — which DBS potentially can do.</p>



<p>"We now have several early studies showing promise in suppressing the rapid increase in dopamine that makes people feel high," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rethinking reward</strong></h2>



<p>In 2023, a record <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">112,000 people</a> in the U.S. died after overdosing on drugs, including illicit drugs and prescription opioids. Even though several psychological and pharmaceutical treatments are available for addiction, as many as 75% to 98% of patients relapse.</p>



<p>"What's unique about addiction is it creates a pattern in the brain that is self-perpetuating. Essentially, the behavior reinforces itself, making it very resistant to intervention," says Mayo Clinic addiction psychiatrist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/oesterle-tyler-s-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20549206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyler Oesterle, M.D.</a></p>



<p>The brain is wired to make pleasure a priority. The brain’s reward system connects two tiny regions: the ventral tegmental area, which releases the feel-good chemical dopamine, and the nucleus accumbens, which controls memory and behavior. The former is why you feel a jolt of pleasure after biting into a hamburger. The latter is why your mouth waters whenever you smell someone fire up a grill. Drugs can overload this system, flooding it with dopamine and strengthening the connections that undergird addiction.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="458" height="457" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Hojin-Shin.jpg" alt="Image of Hojin Shin, Ph.D." class="wp-image-382297" style="width:200px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Hojin-Shin.jpg 458w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Hojin-Shin-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Hojin-Shin-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hojin Shin, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But what if you could short-circuit the reward system? If drugs no longer triggered a high, would they be easier to stop using? Preliminary research in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35411483/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animal models and humans</a> suggests that it is possible to curtail drug-seeking behavior by electrically stimulating brain regions associated with reward.</p>



<p>"The results are promising, but we still don’t know how it works," says Mayo Clinic biomedical engineer <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/neural-engineering/about/meet-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hojin Shin, Ph.D.</a> "What we really need is a technique that allows us to see how the brain works and how the brain changes in response to stimulation so we can use that information to improve the treatment."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A dopamine sensor</strong></h2>



<p>As part of the Mayo Clinic Neural Engineering Laboratory, Dr. Shin and his colleague <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/neural-engineering/about/meet-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoonbae Oh, Ph.D.</a>, have been busy devising novel techniques to measure brain chemicals — such as dopamine and serotonin — in real time. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27774784/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent iterations</a> use electrodes composed of flexible carbon fibers thinner than a human hair, wirelessly connected to an electronic circuit that can simultaneously stimulate neurons and detect neurochemicals.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="459" height="574" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Yoonbae-Oh.jpg" alt="Image of Yoonbae Oh, Ph.D." class="wp-image-382298" style="width:200px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Yoonbae-Oh.jpg 459w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Yoonbae-Oh-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Yoonbae Oh, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The researchers have used their innovations to glean important insights into the mechanisms of DBS and addiction. In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36793536/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one study</a>, they used DBS to activate the dopamine-producing ventral tegmental area in rodent brains. Then they administered a hit of a highly addictive stimulant. The experimental DBS treatment cut the flow of dopamine to the nucleus accumbens, the brain’s reward center, by nearly half.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37408764/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another study</a>, the team tested the approach on a rodent model of opioid addiction. When they gave the models a powerful opioid, they saw a spike in dopamine levels. But when they treated the models with DBS before administering the drug, that spike never happened. The experimental treatment also appeared to inhibit respiratory depression, the breathing difficulties responsible for the majority of opioid overdose deaths.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="390" height="588" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Tyler-Oesterle.jpg" alt="Image of Tyler Oesterle, M.D." class="wp-image-382299" style="width:200px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Tyler-Oesterle.jpg 390w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Tyler-Oesterle-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tyler Oesterle, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The team recently received a grant from the National Institutes of Health <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/3SytIPxgmEywri__9yY6hg/project-details/10477708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to obtain approval for an FDA Investigational Device Exemption</a>, a necessary step for future preclinical studies and clinical trials of this experimental treatment.</p>



<p>"To see addiction as a biological problem, and to address it with biological treatments like this, is a paradigm shift," says Dr. Oesterle. "We know that the standard behavioral or pharmaceutical interventions don't work for everybody. We're pushing the envelope here because we know we need to do something different, truly different, to help people rebuild their lives."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Too often, the first sign of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a> may be a major event like a heart attack, stroke or cardiac arrest. Now, researchers and clinicians at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> are using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to flag heart problems earlier, boosting the abilities of a diagnostic test that has been around for over a century — the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram (ECG)</a>.   </p>



<p>Early detection of heart disease can make a significant difference in a patient's quality of life and longevity, but a lack of defining symptoms adds complexity. The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ai-cardiology/overview/ovc-20486648?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-enabled ECG</a> provides a way to potentially detect heart disease earlier and track disease progression using a test that is relatively inexpensive, readily available and often already part of a patient's electronic health record.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has developed ECG-AI algorithms that are currently used in research to predict a patient's likelihood of having heart conditions like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a>, amyloidosis, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-stenosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353139?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aortic stenosis</a>, low ejection fraction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and more. The AI can also predict a patient's biological age using traditional 12-lead and single-lead ECGs from smartwatches and portable devices.</p>



<p>One standout application is the use of ECG-AI to detect low ejection fraction, commonly called a weak heart pump. The 12-lead algorithm for detecting this condition is cleared for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and licensed to <a href="https://anumana.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anumana</a>. A single-lead algorithm for handheld devices externally applied to the chest is licensed to <a href="https://www.ekohealth.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eko Health</a> for commercial development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Diagnosing a weak heart pump</h2>



<p>Approximately 3% of Americans have a treatable condition called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/expert-answers/ejection-fraction/faq-20058286?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low ejection fraction</a>, where the heart is weakened and pumps less blood out to the body. The underlying causes and symptoms are often treatable, but people may not be aware of their condition until symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue and swelling in their legs start to get worse. Left untreated, low ejection fraction can progress to worsening <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>, affecting quality of life and potentially become severe enough to require a heart transplant or lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the symptoms of a weak heart pump can be confused with those seen with normal pregnancy. At Mayo Clinic in Florida, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20507418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demilade Adedinsewo, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a cardiologist, uses AI as a tool to detect a condition in women called peripartum <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiomyopathy</a>, a weak heart pump that can develop during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. Heart muscle weakness can be predicted with AI from a traditional 12-lead ECG and from an AI-enabled digital stethoscope that captures single-lead ECG and heart sound recordings.</p>



<p>"Our research with obstetric patients in Nigeria suggests that portable technology like the AI-enabled digital stethoscope has the potential to flag twice as many cases of peripartum cardiomyopathy as compared to routine care," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "It may be a powerful tool to bring portable cardiomyopathy diagnostics to more women in underserved urban and rural populations around the world. Access is an important consideration in addressing health disparities in the U.S., because Black women have up to a sixteenfold greater risk of developing peripartum cardiomyopathy, compared to white women."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Amyloid buildup in the heart</h2>



<p>Amyloidosis is a rare disease of misfolded proteins that go astray to form deposits of amyloid in organs, nerves and tissues. There are several different types, but when enough <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiac-amyloidosis-clinic/overview/ovc-20508423?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amyloid builds up in the heart</a>, it causes heart failure and symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid buildup and fainting. Patients also can have heart rhythm problems and might need a pacemaker. Early diagnosis is critical because, while amyloidosis is not curable, it is treatable with new medical therapies that can dramatically reduce the amount of amyloid produced and stop disease progression.</p>



<p>Using ECG-AI, clinicians at Mayo Clinic can potentially flag patients who are in the early stages of cardiac amyloidosis. The technology is used in research and has FDA breakthrough device designation.</p>



<p>"We've done some research indicating that, if we apply artificial intelligence just to the electrocardiogram, we can suggest if the patient has the diagnosis, often before a clinician has even suspected it. So we believe that this is a way to make an early diagnosis," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grogan-martha-m-d/bio-20053492?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martha Grogan, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "Now, it has to be put in clinical context. It's not just that one AI ECG, but it can really help us suspect amyloidosis."</p>



<p>"It's a very powerful tool because it's inexpensive. It's available almost everywhere. Our research showed that even a single lead, which is something that you could do on a watch or a simple mobile device, can give us this prediction of amyloidosis," says Dr. Grogan. "So, one could imagine that, in underserved populations throughout the world, a simple ECG might help determine if a patient has amyloidosis, especially in those high-risk groups."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a> is one of the most common genetic heart diseases, affecting 1 in 200 to 500 people. HCM happens when the heart's walls become thicker over time, which can disrupt the heart's electrical signals, increasing the risk of sudden cardiac death. Unfortunately, people often don't notice any symptoms until the disease progresses. It's like having a silent intruder in your heart.</p>



<p>Early detection is crucial but challenging. HCM does not always show up on basic tests, such as a 12-lead ECG. Most patients would not be referred to more resource-intensive tests, like an echocardiogram or MRI, unless a problem was suspected. But ECG-AI can spot HCM by recognizing subtle patterns that even expert clinicians might miss.</p>



<p>"Applying this AI algorithm to routine ECGs shows promise as a means to make early detection of HCM more practical, accurate and accessible as part of a heart health checkup," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/siontis-konstantinos-m-d/bio-20503925?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Konstantinos Siontis, M.D.</a>, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. "Athletes with yet undiagnosed HCM, who may be more at risk of dangerous arrhythmias during exercise, could benefit from early detection. And because HCM often runs in families, detecting it early in one person can lead to identifying other family members at risk."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers are studying whether specialized T cells taken from blood could harness the body's immune system to treat or someday cure complex inflammatory diseases.</p>



<p>Researchers are probing whether a subset of T cells known as regulatory T cells, or Tregs, have the power to suppress out-of-control immune responses. If so, they want to know if this could offer a new therapeutic option for chronic inflammation that does not respond to standard treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/faubion-william-a-jr-m-d/bio-00027222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William Faubion, Jr., M.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist who is dean of Research at Mayo Clinic in Arizona and medical director of Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> is leading a team of researchers focused on the therapeutic value of Tregs for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>.</p>



<p>"While many new agents are emerging for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, unfortunately many patients still do not completely respond, leaving a huge unmet need,” says Dr. Faubion. "Tregs are master regulators that control the immune response through many mechanisms; thus, we are interested to learn if they could restore proper immune tolerance."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new approach to cell therapy</strong></h2>



<p>The allure of Tregs lies in their potential to deliver healing messages to diseased tissues while sparing normal tissues. Dr<em>. </em>Faubion's team will study whether Tregs can be loaded with specific receptors to target intestinal inflammatory conditions and restore healthy immune function for patients. Preclinical studies have shown promising results, but engineered Tregs have not yet been studied in humans at Mayo Clinic. Exploring Tregs as a cellular therapy in clinical care would be a new approach for targeting the molecular underpinnings of inflammation and stopping it at its source.</p>



<p>"Many of the current anti-inflammatory medicines have negative side effects, such as infections," says Dr. Faubion. "New solutions are needed. Our hope is to understand whether Treg cell therapy could control symptoms, minimize the risks and be a more convenient form of treatment than currently exists for chronic inflammation."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cellular mechanisms in action</strong></h2>



<p>T cells are a type of white blood cell that act as beacons of protection, triggering the immune system to block viruses, bacteria and abnormal cells that cause disease. However, an "off target" effect of T cells can shift the body's inflammatory system into overdrive and cause it to mistakenly attack healthy tissue. The result can be autoimmune disorders such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriasis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">psoriasis</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rheumatoid arthritis</a> and inflammatory bowel diseases like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a>.</p>



<p>Approximately 8% of people in the U.S. have an autoimmune disease, according to the <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/OADR-ORWH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>. Standard therapies can sometimes ease the symptoms but are not a cure.</p>



<p>Tregs, derived from T cells, act as gatekeepers of the immune system. They release anti-inflammatory molecules and growth factors to control the body's immune response. They also prevent new T cells from activating, while recruiting other immune cells to promote a calming, immune-tolerance environment that could control or stop inflammatory disorders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing Tregs for inflammatory disease</strong></h2>



<p>To better understand the clinical potential of these specialized cells, researchers take Tregs from a patient's blood and then modify them for use in clinical trials. The Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics is engineering these cells and establishing a process for isolation, expansion and biomanufacturing. The goal is to ensure the cells meet safety and quality standards for patients in clinical trials.</p>



<p>"On-site facilities at Mayo Clinic allow us to begin the biomanufacturing process without delays and limit the risks to biological integrity that can come with shipping," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, the Michael S. and Mary Sue Shannon Director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "We are excited about the prospect of offering Tregs as an experimental cell therapy that is studied in clinical trials for patients with complex inflammatory diseases." &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Allickson is also the Otto Bremer Trust Director, Biomanufacturing and Product Development, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>A better understanding of Tregs on a molecular level could have clinical value. Mayo Clinic research teams in Arizona are poised to lead this research in collaboration with colleagues in Rochester and Florida.</p>



<p>Dr. Faubion's team hopes to obtain regulatory approval for clinical trials to study Tregs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease by the fourth quarter of 2024.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types of encephalitis</h2>



<p>The two main types or divisions of encephalitis are infectious and autoimmune. In some cases, the exact cause of encephalitis remains unidentified.</p>



<p><strong>Important things to know about infectious encephalitis</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>It's caused by viruses invading the brain, such as herpes and enteroviruses.</li>



<li>Mosquitoes and ticks can also transmit viruses which can cause encephalitis.</li>



<li>Symptoms develop quickly, over days to weeks.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Most people with infectious encephalitis start with symptoms such as headache and fever. These can progress to more severe symptoms within hours to days, such as confusion, personality changes, seizures, and loss of sensation or movement in specific body areas.</p>



<p><strong>Important things to know about autoimmune encephalitis:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The immune system mistakenly attacks the brain.</li>



<li>It primarily targets people from their first year of life to late 80s,&nbsp;both women and men. Some forms preferentially affect young or old; males or females.</li>



<li>It can be triggered by an infection elsewhere in the body (post-infectious autoimmune encephalitis) or a tumor (paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis). But in about 90% of cases, the cause is not found.</li>



<li>Symptoms can develop quickly, as per infectious encephalitis, or more slowly, over weeks to months, and may not include fever.</li>



<li>Those symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis may include changes in personality, memory loss, problems understanding reality (psychosis), hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there), seizures and unusual movements.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing encephalitis</h2>



<p>Prevention is a significant challenge, says Dr. Irani.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We do not have consistent preventive measures for these illnesses. Only a few infectious causes may be prevented with vaccinations. There are also a few causes of infectious encephalitis which we can prevent through limiting person-to-person spread or by trying to stop, for example, vectors like mosquitoes infecting some patients. But for autoimmune causes, we don't know of ways to prevent this illness, yet this is a major question from all of our patients," he says.</p>

<p>Dr. Irani leads a research team studying autoimmune neurological diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"One of our principal goals is to figure out how we can educate other neurologists and physicians around the world to identify patients earlier and give them early treatment," says Dr. Irani.</p>



<p>He says the research is about using science to create personalized treatments that make a difference for patients.</p>



<p>"I see ourselves as a translational research group. We see patients, care for them clinically, and obtain samples from our patients to understand their disease more closely," he says. "We then correlate clinical findings with those we obtain in our laboratory."</p>



<p>As for the laboratory work, he's interested in learning more about how these diseases occur.</p>



<p>"We want to know how the cells of the immune system that caused the illness appeared, how they perpetuate, which bodily compartments they go to, which parts of the body they reside in, and then, of course, fundamentally, how we can accurately delete them without giving the patients many side effects," says Dr. Irani.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Present and future research</h2>



<p>"In the short term, I hope this research will help patients by giving physicians a better understanding of when we should treat patients, how we should recognize them and which treatments might be most effective in which scenarios," he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"In the longer term, I hope we'll be able to build a platform by which we can interrogate each disease in turn and, as they all are slightly different to each other, try and ask how they cross compare to one another. And how can we offer the right patient the right treatment at the right time," says Dr. Irani.</p>

<p>Getting sufficient representation of racial and ethnic minority populations in clinical trials remains a pervasive challenge, despite concerted efforts by researchers and mandates set by funding sources and regulatory agencies. A lack of diversity in research results in continued disparities and poorer health outcomes in underrepresented communities.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00349-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An article in the January edition of Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a> proposes a wide range of strategies to help researchers improve community engagement with underrepresented racial and ethnic populations and reduce the "clinical trials disparity gap."</p>

<p>"Through careful deliberation and involvement with community partners, researchers can develop tailored blueprints for clinical trials that can ensure that our science reflects the needs of all populations," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/odedina-folakemi-t-ph-d/bio-20516377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Folakemi Odedina, Ph.D.</a>, first author of the article, titled "Community Engagement Strategies for Underrepresented Racial and Ethnic Populations."</p>



<p>The article is the latest in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00186-6/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of thematic reviews</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>&nbsp;about the digital transformation of clinical trials to improve healthcare and address health inequities through innovations in research design.</p>



<p>Racial and ethnic minority populations remain underrepresented in clinical trials despite decades of mandates, commitments and good intentions, Dr. Odedina says. "This inequity produces clinical trial demographics that are not representative and thus perpetuate health disparities in marginalized racial and ethnic communities," she says.</p>



<p>Among the strategies discussed in the article:</p>



<ul>
<li>Making community engagement a key element of clinical trials design to achieve representative demographics and findings. "Community-engaged research is foundational to incorporating community voice and priorities into clinical and translational research," the authors say.</li>



<li>Using best practices for community-engaged trials, including defining the community, identifying community partners, determining the level of community engagement and sustaining engagement over time to deepen relationships.</li>



<li>Remaining open at the research level to changes that allow shared power with the community and include opportunities for input and feedback from the community for continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>



<p>A demographically representative and inclusive trial design is essential for optimal diagnosis, treatment and prevention decisions to be made, especially for underserved and marginalized populations, the authors say.</p>

<p>Tammy LeDoux could never have imagined she had a tumor the size of a pineapple growing on her left ovary. Or that precancerous polyps were lurking in her stomach and colon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I never had any cramping. I never had any pain. I never felt anything hard or lumpy in my abdomen or down in my pelvic area. I never knew anything was there," says Tammy, an information technology analyst who lives in Wisconsin.</p>



<p>The surprising discoveries came after Tammy underwent genetic screening via the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, which revealed she has <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome.</a> The disorder is associated with an 80% risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a> and 50% risk of uterine and endometrial cancer.</p>



<p>"I honestly feel like knowing these genetic results has saved my life," Tammy says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tammy's experience mirrors that of many other patients who, prior to participating in the Center’s DNA sequencing research study, called Tapestry, were unaware of their disease risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, nearly 1.3 million Mayo Clinic patients like Tammy were invited to join Tapestry, which screened for three hereditary conditions: familial hypercholesterolemia (hereditary high cholesterol), hereditary breast and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a> (BRCA1 and BRCA2), and Lynch syndrome. Of those, roughly 100,000 chose to participate.</p>



<p>Based on existing literature, the study anticipated nearly 2% of participants would receive a positive result.</p>



<p>"What keeps me up at night is the fact that 1.2 million patients chose <em>not</em> to participate in the study, and this means around 20,000 of them likely have an undiagnosed hereditary risk or condition when considering the 2 percent rate of a positive result," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Konstantinos Lazaridis,</a> the Carlson and Nelson Endowed Executive Director for Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine.</p>



<p>"We need to do better job of educating people about the value of genetic screening for rare but preventable conditions," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Lazaridis says Mayo Clinic is advancing the idea of bringing genetic screening to routine patient care to help identify patients at high risk for cancer and other diseases, enabling earlier screening and mitigating the risk of cancer, the need to use expensive and limited therapies for advanced disease, and reducing premature deaths.</p>



<p>Beyond disease prevention, Mayo Clinic researchers are investigating volumes of Tapestry data to drive forward medical discoveries that enhance novel diagnostics and treatments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Launching the Mayo Clinic Early Onset and Hereditary GI Cancers Program</strong></h2>



<p>In tandem with these efforts, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/samadder-niloy-jewel-m-d/bio-20396993">Dr. Niloy Jewel Samadder</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wu-christina-s-m-b-b-ch-m-d/bio-20529971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Christina Wu,</a> physician scientists in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, launched a new program in February 2024 to address the significant rise of colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers in young people.</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic Early Onset and Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancers Program is dedicated to patients under the age of 55 who are diagnosed with colorectal, gastric, esophageal, liver, bile duct or pancreatic cancer.</p>



<p>This patient-centric program creates an integrated network of services involving gastroenterology, gynecology, oncology, colorectal surgery, infertility, pathology, genetics and adolescent and young adult specialists.</p>



<p>In 2022, Mayo Clinic's three campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota reported over 2,000 newly diagnosed cases of gastrointestinal cancers among people under the age of 55. The marked rise in young-onset colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers underscores a pressing health issue. The new program aims to provide accelerated access to top-tier care.</p>



<p>Dr. Samadder emphasizes that encircling patients with a multidisciplinary team of specialists will help provide the best possible outcomes.</p>



<p>"Our goal is to put the patient at the center of a collaborative framework of experts from diverse fields working seamlessly together," says Dr. Samadder, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and cancer geneticist.</p>



<p>"The program also incorporates translational discoveries such as immunology and cancer evolution, as well as a clinical trial menu, research initiatives and a multi-omics approach that connects to a patient's unique biological datasets,” Dr. Samadder says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tammy’s journey to the Tapestry study</strong></h2>



<p>Tammy’s initial motivation to participate in the Tapestry DNA research study was her curiosity about her ancestral heritage — another aspect of the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon receiving her genetic screening results, Tammy's team of genetic counselors and physicians moved quickly to educate her on Lynch Syndrome and help her schedule various screenings, including a colonoscopy, urine biopsy and ultrasound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These screenings uncovered 10 polyps in her colon and stomach, some with precancerous characteristics, and two concerning moles on her skin. Soon after, Tammy made the proactive decision to undergo a hysterectomy to reduce her cancer risk. It was during this procedure that surgeons discovered and removed the sizable benign tumor.</p>



<p>"I couldn’t believe it. I’m beyond grateful," Tammy says. "I've been through the ringer, but now I have peace of mind knowing I've reduced my risks for cancer, and I can go in every couple years to check for any new polyps."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is dedicated to shaping a future where cancers and other diseases can be prevented altogether, or identified at earlier stages, allowing for more precise treatment by a collaborative team of specialists.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><strong>From the time she was a young woman, Gladys Asiedu, Ph.D., knew she wanted to help people. Her path to achieving that goal began in Ghana. Learn about her journey and the difference she is making as a diversity science researcher.</strong></h5>

<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/asiedu-gladys-b-ph-d/bio-20528987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gladys Asiedu, Ph.D.</a>, always knew she wanted to make a difference in people's lives. A steady focus on that altruistic goal would ultimately lead her to Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>As a child in Ghana in West Africa, she didn't know what that would mean, or how she would get there.</p>



<p>She received her undergraduate degree in English and religious studies from the University of Cape Coast in Ghana. In 2004, she and her family landed in Manhattan, Kansas, where she pursued graduate education at Kansas State University, receiving a master's in family studies and human services, a Ph.D. in family studies, and a graduate certificate in women's studies.</p>



<p>Her research career in Kansas began with a question: What happens when you or someone you love is diagnosed with HIV or AIDS? What are the mental and social impacts on patients and their families? And how do those impacts affect treatment?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A passion for equity in the pursuit of health and wellness</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Asiedu's experience in international and community health programs before coming to the U.S. gave her firsthand knowledge of the devastating effects of such a diagnosis on underprivileged and underserved populations.</p>

<p>In both her <a href="https://krex.k-state.edu/handle/2097/325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">master's thesis</a> and Ph.D. dissertation, Dr. Asiedu argued that HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination is not something that affects just one person or one family. It is a systemic issue that affects the health and well-being of a whole community, as well as healthcare providers and care systems.</p>



<p>Dr. Asiedu observed that this stigma was fueled by misinformation and limited understanding of science, and she proposed that education was the first step to averting fears related to the disease.</p>



<p>"An aspect of our human survival mechanism is to fear the unknown and to stigmatize it," says Dr. Asiedu. "Some of the findings of the research illuminate the misconceptions, misinformation and limited knowledge of HIV that fueled the stigmatization of those diagnosed with the disease." &nbsp;</p>



<p>Her <a href="https://krex.k-state.edu/handle/2097/6698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dissertation</a> expanded on this finding and illustrated that community-based, participatory research — <a href="https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/programs/extramural/community-based-participatory.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a newly emerging concept at the time</a> — was an effective way to identify potential interventions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A continuing focus on community</strong></h2>



<p>In 2010, Dr. Asiedu moved to Rochester, where she hoped to help build a world where people would have equitable experiences and opportunities to live their healthiest and happiest lives.</p>



<p>Mayo didn't initially seem like a promising place to pursue her passion, with sparse ongoing social science research at the time.</p>



<p>"But there is always a first time, and in the first year, I worked with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pruthi-sandhya-m-d/bio-00083681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sandhya Pruthi</a> in Women's Health, who was crafting cancer screening interventions tailored to the culture and beliefs of low-income women in the Southeastern communities to increase rates of breast cancer screening," Dr. Asiedu says.</p>



<p>"Then I did a postdoc in health services research with Dr. Carmen Radecki Breitkopf, looking at disparities in common cancer screenings, preventive and therapeutic care," she says.</p>



<p>That's when she began to think Mayo might hold opportunities for the kind of work she wanted to pursue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Diversity science</strong></h2>



<p>Today, Dr. Asiedu is a leading researcher in the new <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/research-activities/diversity-science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diversity Science Program</a> of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a>.</p>



<p>Program Director <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/blocker-renaldo-c-ph-d/bio-20121385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Renaldo Blocker, Ph.D.</a>, Dr. Asiedu and other colleagues defined diversity science at Mayo. They started by thinking about the biases and inequities in the U.S.</p>



<p>"We were initially moved by our own experiences and the experiences of our colleagues, and were passionate about effecting change in our workplace and community," says Dr. Asiedu. "We became passionate about addressing this for our own institution and wanted to do good in the workforce space. &nbsp;But after the murder of George Floyd, it grew beyond the initial vision."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic pledged $100 million to eliminate racism, advance equity and inclusion within Mayo Clinic, and improve health equity for people everywhere.</p>



<p>"This pledge from Mayo signifies the investment that the organization has in advancing equity, and that meant so much for what we wanted to do," says Dr. Asiedu. "So it was incumbent on us to define our tasks within the commitment that Mayo made and to reimagine how we approach diversity at Mayo."</p>



<p>That meant revisiting how to design diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and health equity studies in a more scientific and rigorous manner, and ensuring that diversity, equity and inclusion research and discoveries by Mayo happen in a systematic, scientifically sound manner.</p>



<p>"We created the Diversity Science Program to be a hub for scientists and practitioners who wanted to work in this space but needed the guidance, consults and strategies that could potentially accelerate progress toward inclusivity through research," Dr. Asiedu says.</p>



<p>The team knew their work had to be more than just internal to Mayo. They needed to address the needs of the workforce, patients and community. They had to investigate and build interventions for sustainable transformation inside Mayo and across the global community.</p>



<p>"The fact that this program came into existence signifies our recognition of inequities and inequalities in our world, oppressions and disparities that come from systems of power," Dr. Asiedu says. "Systemic structures and cultural norms that have allowed dominant groups to undermine the value and dignity of members of minority groups.</p>



<p>"Launching the Diversity Science Program showed a renewed commitment by Mayo to conduct the rigorous research that underlies transformation and to share the knowledge gained through investigation and implementation of interventions," says Dr. Asiedu. "It's about time we change the science of characterizing inequities and disparities and move toward impactful science that implements interventions and programs resulting in equity and meaningful outcomes for all groups of people."</p>



<p>For Dr. Asiedu, the birth of the Diversity Science Program also expanded her ability to pursue health equity from myriad perspectives.</p>



<p>Dr. Asiedu invests her research expertise in investigations across all the program focus areas because she feels strongly about holistically examining health and healthcare delivery within larger contexts and identifying ways to improve outcomes and satisfaction among those who experience the most significant disparities.</p>



<p>She derives much satisfaction from her work, which feeds her passion. Her personal life provides more evidence of her commitment to improving the lives of others.</p>



<p>Between the demands of being an "Uber driver" for her school-aged kids, she volunteers for community-building activities in her church. Dr. Asiedu is surrounded by her community of friends and family who inspire and expand on her ideas to make a difference for people in the U.S., her home country, and perhaps the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seeking a new perspective on clinical trial participation among underrepresented minority patients</strong></h2>



<p>Together with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/price-katharine-a-m-d/bio-20521904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katharine Price, M.D.</a>, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/warsame-rahma-m-d/bio-20207073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rahma Warsame, M.D.</a>, and others, Dr. Asiedu explored the experiences, motivations, and decision-making of underrepresented minority patients successfully treated in a cancer clinical trial. After reviewing existing literature, they deliberately chose a mixed-methods approach, considering the question from an entirely new angle.</p>



<p>This positive approach acknowledges the existing strengths and everyday experiences of these patients.</p>



<p>"We wanted to gain some idea of barriers and facilitators to clinical trial enrollment through an appreciative inquiry," Dr. Asiedu says.</p>



<p>That meant approaching patients already in a clinical trial and asking, "What are your motivations for participating in this clinical trial?"</p>



<p>The team used surveys and the photo-elicitation interview technique — a visual research method — to explore and understand the motivations and facilitators of trial participation.</p>



<p>"PEI (photo-elicitation interview) is a powerful method for illuminating human experience and surfacing information, which may otherwise remain invisible using conventional approaches," says Dr. Asiedu. "This approach has the potential to alter clinical trial recruitment efforts that include patient-generated visuals of clinical trial experiences that could enhance culturally tailored educational programming."</p>



<p>The authors found that altruism appears to be a significant motivator to enroll in a cancer clinical trial. This message could be incorporated into recruitment strategies to improve the recruitment of diverse patients.</p>



<p>To gain a more comprehensive picture, the study included perspectives from physicians, study coordinators, clinical trial investigators, recruitment personnel and other staff involved in clinical trials to provide important insight into the complex issue of inclusive accrual.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Dr. Asiedu and the team's most critical observation was that clinical trial participation requires a relational approach. It is more than a simple two-party contractual agreement.</p>



<p>"It's not just you, the patient, making the decision. It is a decision for you and your family and friends and together with doctors," she says.</p>



<p>The team expects their study results to be published soon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Effectively engaging the community to reach vulnerable populations during a public health crisis</strong></h2>



<p>Early in the COVID pandemic, Dr. Asiedu worked with two research teams to develop and evaluate a community-engaged bidirectional crisis and emergency-risk communications framework to assist in reaching immigrant communities as well as African Americans in Southeast Minnesota. The researchers knew they needed to work with the communities to identify the paths likely to lead to receptiveness. They needed to refine the messaging in ways that were both palatable and encouraged action while reducing fear and uncertainty.</p>



<p>The two research teams, <a href="https://rochesterhealthy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rochester Healthy Community Partnership</a> led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sia-irene-g-m-d/bio-00085447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irene Sia, M.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wieland-mark-l-m-d-m-p-h/bio-00093813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Wieland, M.D.</a>, and <a href="https://faith4heart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAITH!</a> led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/brewer-laprincess-c-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20249241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LaPrincess Brewer, M.D.</a>, developed a bidirectional communication approach using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication model from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to address COVID-19 prevention, testing, and socioeconomic impacts with immigrant, refugee and African American groups in Southeast Minnesota. This communication framework was culturally tailored and adapted to the needs of the immigrant and African American population in Southeast Minnesota.</p>



<p>This communication intervention reached over 40,000 community members in seven different language groups across Olmsted County. Framework implementation also led to systems and policy changes to meet the needs of immigrant, refugee and African American populations.</p>



<p>"The project helped reduce COVID-19 disparities through shared creation and dissemination of public health messages, enhanced connection to existing resources, and incorporation of community perspectives in regional pandemic mitigation policies," says Dr. Asiedu. "The framework has been adapted for use in other communities to encourage participation in healthful health communication to diverse populations."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting big-city care to the bedsides of the tiniest rural patients</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Asiedu worked with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fang-jennifer-l-m-d/bio-00027602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Fang, M.D.</a>, and her team to determine the best way to incorporate remote neonatology consultative support in hospitals without local access to this specialty.</p>



<p>It seemed simple: Add video telemedicine for newborn resuscitation care, thereby lessening rural health disparities and improving the odds of safer deliveries and healthier babies.</p>



<p>The team quickly realized this, too, was about relationships. Local doctors needed to be brought into conversations where they would learn the value of technology in helping them provide the best possible care for their patients. They needed to understand how the process would work, how the neonatologist would integrate with their local team, and how this intervention would improve outcomes. The research turned toward developing an effective outreach and education program that felt empowering for the rural care providers.</p>

<p><strong>Improving care for men with prostate cancer who are also immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa</strong></p>



<p>Most recently, Dr. Asiedu has been working with colleagues at <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/3-sites-1-comprehensive-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> to customize another framework — one for understanding the social determinants of migrant health. They hope their work leads to improved care and survivorship experiences for Black men with prostate cancer.</p>



<p>The current investigation is a <a href="https://iccare4blackmen.org/pilotproject4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pilot study among sub-Saharan African immigrants</a>, identifying factors contributing to health-seeking behavior. Their findings advance knowledge in the <a href="https://iccare4blackmen.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iCCaRE Consortium</a>, a shortened name for the Inclusive Cancer Care Research Equity for Black Men Consortium.</p>



<p>The team expects to expand the pilot to phase 2 in early 2024, involving other African and Caribbean immigrant communities and expanding collaborations to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p>

<p>As a resident in internal medicine, Ramez Barsoom, M.D., is often considering ways to improve healthcare, but inspiration struck one day as he was doing an ordinary household chore. While using tools to mount a TV on the wall, he got an idea for a new medical device to simplify the detection of pneumonia in patients' lungs.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Barsoom_Ramez_A._Ramez_Barsoom_30268052_20230410.jpg" alt="Image of Ramez Barsoom, M.D." class="wp-image-381574" style="width:175px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Barsoom_Ramez_A._Ramez_Barsoom_30268052_20230410.jpg 640w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Barsoom_Ramez_A._Ramez_Barsoom_30268052_20230410-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ramez Barsoom, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Barsoom, who came to <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education</a> last year as an M.D. with a master's degree in engineering, began noodling about developing the device. "I typically keep an innovation journal where I jot down all the different ideas that come to me, " he says. "Periodically, I set aside time to review each idea individually and assess whether the clinical need warrants a solution and hasn't been addressed before."</p>



<p>As a creative problem-solver who’s eager to explore new ideas, Dr. Barsoom is not alone. He is among many trainees at Mayo Clinic who, while learning the craft of their careers, are also strategizing about ways to transform healthcare. Several programs at Mayo are helping these enterprising inventors ask the right questions and take the steps to bring their innovative ideas to market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Innovating step by step</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Barsoom quickly realized his idea addressed an important medical need. Pneumonia remains a significant health issue worldwide, and diagnosing it often involves X-rays, which may be too costly for communities with few resources.</p>



<p>One of the first challenges he faced was engineering a version of his device. (While the invention is in development, details are unavailable.) He was able to learn the steps involved in device development from the <a href="https://innovationexchange.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Innovation Exchange</a>, a resource that connects inventors with experts from healthcare, engineering and business. Drawing on his engineering background, he worked out a basic design and conducted an initial series of experiments to test the concept. </p>



<p>According to<a> </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hedges-mary-s-m-d/bio-20055284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary Hedges, M.D.</a>, program director for internal medicine residency in Florida, innovation is an essential focus in the training of new physicians. The residency program is among the first in the nation to add a formal innovation curriculum to physician training. "This is the future of medicine," she says. "Our residency aims to provide trainees with exposure to innovation, whether it's just an introduction or more in-depth opportunities for those who intend to make it part of their careers."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking the stage to pitch the idea</strong></h2>



<p>As Dr. Barsoom's concept moved forward, he applied to pitch it at a competition hosted by the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/offices/office-of-entrepreneurship/resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Office of Entrepreneurship</a>: the Alligator Tank in Florida, one of Mayo's healthcare innovation-launching events that occur on each campus. (Inventors on the Rochester campus participate in the <a href="https://www.walleyetank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walleye Tank</a>; those in Arizona join the <a href="https://mayoclinicasualliance.org/event/2023-scorpion-tank-healthcare-pitch-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scorpion Tank</a>.)</p>



<p>The format of the events is similar to the TV show Shark Tank, in which inventors describe new products in under two minutes to a panel of judges. The panel — in this case, a team of Mayo clinicians and innovation experts — asks questions and then votes on a winner.</p>



<p>"Some of the winning ideas from previous years are now products on the market or are in clinical trials," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/bruce-charles-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-00086002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Bruce, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, chief innovation officer in Florida.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Dr. Barsoom's presentation was among several that impressed the judges. He won a cash prize of $2,500. His project also earned a grant from the Mayo Clinic Innovation Exchange, which paired him with an external engineering firm to further develop the device.</p>



<p>"The next steps involve transforming my preliminary bench-tested solution into a minimum viable prototype and ultimately developing clinical trials that are necessary to test it," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creating tools to make physicians' lives easier</strong></h2>



<p>Francis Shue was excited when she realized she might be onto a big idea that could potentially be the basis of a startup company. &nbsp;As a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>, Shue studies Alzheimer's disease in the lab of neuroscientist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kanekiyo-takahisa-m-d-ph-d/bio-00055074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Takahisa Kanekiyo, M.D., Ph.D.</a> Alongside her bench research, her curiosity was piqued by artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>Working with the lab's collaborators at Carnegie Mellon, she began to explore a side project, using AI to organize patients' X-rays and other imaging tests. "My idea started out completely in the research sphere," she says. "We wanted to create something to make physicians' lives easier."</p>

<p>As she explored further, the idea seemed to have potential as a business. To learn how to take her idea to the next level, she signed up for a series of classes offered by the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/offices/office-of-entrepreneurship" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Office of Entrepreneurship</a>. The classes introduced her to market and customer research and helped her identify a target audience for the product. The office also helped connect her to executives in industry, whom she interviewed to continue developing her product.</p>



<p>Though she didn't win a prize for her pitch at the Alligator Tank, she is emphatic about the value of the experience and how much she learned along the way. "I was able to get a lot of insider knowledge, hone my business skills and make many wonderful connections," says Shue. She now aims to have a career that involves discovery, innovation and business.</p>

<p>"The Tank events can help fast-track the innovation and the inventor," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/offices/office-of-entrepreneurship/leadership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maarten Rotman, Ph.D.</a>, Entrepreneurial Education Manager of the Office of Entrepreneurship, who hosts the event and helps participants prepare their pitches. "Most importantly, the students take on a new mindset as they conceive of their approach to developing a product and how to present it."</p>



<p>Internal medicine resident Hiva Lee, M.D., agrees. Opportunities like the Alligator Tank enabled him to develop the idea for a device that aims to reduce in-hospital infections.</p>



<p>"There are inevitably bumps along the road when developing a product," he says. "I’m in the middle of one now, as I’m trying to navigate the many paths to funding, research and development—so stay tuned!"</p>

<p>Alex Bechtle was able to jump right in as an inventor thanks to opportunities at Mayo. A few years ago, while still an undergraduate majoring in biomedical engineering, she spent a few summers studying brain cancer in the labs of neurosurgeons <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/quinones-hinojosa-alfredo-m-d/bio-20247553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa, M.D.</a> and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/chaichana-kaisorn-l-m-d/bio-20428510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaisorn Chaichana, M.D.</a> The research teams became interested in using a 3-D printer to develop a new tool to visualize the unique attributes of metastasizing brain cancer cells. Using concepts from her undergraduate classes, Bechtle designed and developed the prototype, which the researchers immediately put to use.</p>



<p>Now a third-year student at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine</a>, Bechtle found additional opportunities to develop the skills inventors need. She fine-tuned a presentation about the 3-D printed device and first pitched it at the Alligator Tank in 2019. With new developments, she pitched it again in 2020, winning the crowd favorite award from the audience. Amid her medical school classes, she also took part in a week-long biomedical innovation "selective," one of the medical school's unique training courses on a specialized topic.</p>



<p>Though she is exploring making the code for the 3-D printed device freely available to researchers, Bechtle says the opportunities to learn about innovation throughout her training have made her even more alert to new ideas. "I do have the perspective of how can we improve a system or how can we improve a tool — and also that it’s essential to connect with others to discuss ideas and find ways to innovate," she says.</p>

<p>A new Mayo Clinic systematic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074152142301306X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review</a> has shed light on genetically inherited aortic disorders, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for those who have inherited cardiovascular risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers identified that a procedure known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/multimedia/endovascular-repair-for-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/img-20123853#:~:text=In%20endovascular%20thoracic%20aortic%20aneurysm,with%20small%20hooks%20or%20pins." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR)</a> provided a high survival rate for young adult patients with type B <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-dissection/symptoms-causes/syc-20369496" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aortic dissections</a>. Type B aortic dissections consist of a tear in the descending part of the aorta that may extend into the abdominal aorta.</p>



<p>"We studied type B aortic dissections and aortic aneurysms and their management, especially in people born with genetic complications or syndromes," says Mohammed M. Firwana, M.B.B.S., research fellow and lead author of the study.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Firwana_Mohammed_21674922_202003050932-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-381417" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Firwana_Mohammed_21674922_202003050932-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Firwana_Mohammed_21674922_202003050932.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mohammed M. Firwana, M.B.B.S., research fellow and lead author of the study.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Notably, in over one-third of patients, genetic testing identified new aortic events within 15&nbsp;years. Patients with genetic risk factors exhibited a 62% rate of recurring aortic events, compared with 11% in patients without genetic risk factors, signifying the potential for more severe complications in the presence of such disorders.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana adds that some of the findings varied by race, underlining the critical need for awareness and early treatment across all demographics.</p>



<p>"One of the more interesting findings was that Black patients with genetic risk factors had lower mortality than White patients, and that's mostly explained by how they presented at a younger age and their condition was likely managed earlier," says Dr. Firwana.<br><br>Researchers underscore that aortic aneurysms, dissections, and ruptures are thought to be the cause of 43,000 to 47,000 fatalities in the U.S. each year and that approximately 20% of thoracic aortic aneurysms are related to the genetic condition, also known as heritable thoracic aortic disease. These conditions are often silent but can lead to aortic dissection or rupture with often fatal outcomes.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana emphasizes that identifying certain genetic mutations provides important knowledge and understanding of genetically inherited aortic disorders in patients.</p>



<p>He adds that there are multiple risk factors that can lead to a higher likelihood of aortic disorders, for example, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/marfan-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marfan syndrome</a>, a connective tissue disease, that affects one in 5,000 people in the U.S.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana notes that another condition that can leave people prone to aortic issues is hypertension.</p>



<p>"Hypertension stands out as an important risk factor," says Dr. Firwana.</p>



<p>"It contributes to the weakening of the walls of the aorta over time, making them more susceptible to tearing or dissection."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/WF516862_0012-1-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-381418" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/WF516862_0012-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/WF516862_0012-1.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">M. Hassan Murad, M.D., senior author of the study</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Researchers note that the systematic review is being used to help support guideline development&nbsp;when managing genetically inherited aortic disorders in patients and that more research is needed to identify the role of Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair in patients with&nbsp;connective tissue disease.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana emphasizes that quitting smoking, managing hypertension, and addressing diabetes are crucial preventive strategies for those with these genetic predispositions.</p>



<p>"A panel of experts from the Society for Vascular Surgery will use this systematic review to develop a clinical practice guideline that aims to help patients make decisions about their care," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/murad-m-hassan-m-d/bio-00094157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M.

<p>The Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) recognizes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldcancerday.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Cancer Day</a>&nbsp;annually on February 4. The UICC's 2024 theme for World Cancer Day is "Close the Care Gap." The care gap is the gap between people who can obtain healthcare related to the prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and those who cannot.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Bold-Rick-J._30304260_20231002-819x1024-1-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-381394" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Bold-Rick-J._30304260_20231002-819x1024-1-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Bold-Rick-J._30304260_20231002-819x1024-1-768x960.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Bold-Rick-J._30304260_20231002-819x1024-1.jpg 819w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></figure></div>


<p>The factors that create this gap include income, education and geographical location barriers. Discrimination based on ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability and lifestyle can also be a barrier. Some people are also more likely to be exposed to factors that increase cancer risk, such as environmental hazards, unhealthy diet and tobacco.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic joins the UICC in breaking down barriers that stand in the way of cancer care. In this Q&amp;A,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/richard-bold-m-d-named-site-director-mayo-clinic-comprehensive-cancer-center-in-arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rick Bold, M.D.</a>, site deputy director for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;in Arizona, discusses Mayo Clinic's commitment to closing the cancer care gap:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does World Cancer Day mean to Mayo Clinic?</h2>



<p>It means understanding the gaps in our cancer care and our cancer outcomes. It means recognizing those gaps by intentionally trying to close and eliminate them. There are different ways to define the gap; it may be related to the incidence of cancer, it may be related to the outcomes of cancer, and it may be related to access to cancer care. Each of these is a different gap that affects how people cope with cancer, how people survive cancer, and how people are diagnosed with cancer. We should strive to close and eliminate each of these gaps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Mayo Clinic doing to help close the cancer care gap?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer</a> is not just one disease. For example, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> is different for each person. Understanding why breast cancer developed at an individualized level — personalized or precision medicine — helps us determine the proper treatment for that patient and leads to better outcomes. Maybe a woman's genes caused cancer to develop. Perhaps it's where she lived — her environmental history or what she ate. We're doing <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/search-results?studySiteStatusesGrouped=Open/Status%20Unknown&amp;pocId=CON-20167633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> reaching out to women across different communities, ethnic backgrounds and age groups to understand how <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-cancer-risk-assessment/about/pac-20393195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer risk</a> is determined. If every person is different, we need to understand that their cancer is different based on who they are. That's one effort that's helping to close the cancer care gap.</p>



<p>Another effort to close the gap is improving access to screening. Cancer screening is one of the most effective tools to reduce the burden of cancer in our communities. However, only some people have access to screening. Mayo Clinic is asking: How can we help everyone get access? How can we make screening easier? For example, can we detect&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colon cancer</a>&nbsp;with a blood test instead of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopy</a>? Can we detect it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/fecal-occult-blood-test/multimedia/fecal-occult-blood-test-kit/img-20007541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a stool sample</a>&nbsp;collected in a person's home without time away from work or family or disrupting intestinal function by drinking a solution to cleanse the colon for a colonoscopy? Mayo Clinic is researching cancer screening tools that can be made available to more people conveniently at a lower cost. These efforts can help us close the gap by detecting more cancers at their earliest stage, which is when cures happen.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is also using technology to close the gap. One example of this is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proton beam therapy</a>&nbsp;for radiation. Mayo Clinic has two proton therapy units, one in Scottsdale, Arizona, and one in Rochester, Minnesota. We've studied how to deliver proton beam therapy in a way that improves patient outcomes. Some people can't take the time to get radiation, which may last weeks or months. Using proton beam therapy, we can shorten treatment time, broadening access by making it more convenient for people to get treatment in a minimally disruptive way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Mayo Clinic doing to reach out to underserved and rural communities facing cancer care barriers?</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic is developing cancer screening techniques that can be implemented internationally while recognizing that even in the U.S., not everybody has a hospital or a cancer center nearby. Many people are geographically isolated from healthcare or may lack insurance that pays for screening. We're trying to identify methods that could detect a variety of cancers early in a patient-friendly fashion, no matter what environment a person is living in and no matter what resources they have.</p>



<p>All Mayo Clinic locations see themselves as serving the community around them. We are developing strategic partnerships and relationships to elevate access to care in those communities and share our clinical expertise. This moves our care beyond the walls of our hospitals and clinics. Moving cancer care into patients' homes is becoming a national concept. We're starting to delve into that model of care. This will expand our ability to serve a broader population, not just in our local communities but nationally or internationally.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Mayo Clinic's goal for the future of cancer care?</h2>



<p>The ideal goal would be to eliminate cancer or turn cancer into a disease nobody needs to worry about. That's a long-term goal, and maybe we will get there.</p>



<p>In the shorter term, the goal is to achieve equitable cancer care that provides the best outcomes in a way that doesn't significantly disrupt the lives of patients and their families while respecting their individuality and their role in decision-making. We want to put all those things together and then always keep working on improving outcomes.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is committed to eliminating care gaps so every patient, regardless of where they live or who they are, receives the same cancer care and experiences the same positive outcomes. Mayo Clinic is here to serve patients. That's our primary mission.</p>
