<p>The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide by Dec. 8 on a&nbsp;new therapy to treat sickle cell disease using gene editing technology called&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2018/07/24/the-gene-editing-tool-crispr-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CRISPR</a>, which stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.</p>



<p>Approximately 250 million people worldwide carry the gene for sickle cell disease. It affects those with roots in Africa, Spanish-speaking regions in the Western Hemisphere, Saudi Arabia, India and Mediterranean countries. In the U.S., sickle cell disease is most common in the African American community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ferdjallah-asmaa-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20518146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Asmaa Ferdjallah</a>&nbsp;(ESS-mah fer-JALL-ah)&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center/pediatric-hematology-oncology-minnesota/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pediatric hematology, oncology</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow transplant&nbsp;</a>physician, is the medical director of Mayo Clinic Children's Center's Comprehensive Pediatric Sickle Cell Program.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Genetics</h3>



<p>"Sickle cell disease is a genetic, inherited disorder. It's caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for hemoglobin," says Dr. Ferdjallah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a baby to be born with the disease, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene.</p>



<p>The normally flexible red blood cells turn into rigid crescent shapes — sickle cells— that get stuck in blood vessels. And that can cause problems down the line.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Screening </h3>



<p>"Fortunately, in the United States, every baby, as part of their newborn screen, is screened for sickle cell disease," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>



<p>Babies may not show symptoms until 5 or 6 months, with pain or swelling in the fingertips. And then, later in life,&nbsp;Dr. Ferdjallah says patients experience, "Pain in the extremities, in the back. It's all caused by those sickle cells being stuck in the blood vessels."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risks</h3>



<p>Along with pain, the risks for heart and kidney damage and stroke are increased.</p>



<p>"Some of our patients actually experienced stroke, or what we call silent strokes, from the sickle cells actually getting stuck and creating a blockage in the cerebral vessels," Dr. Ferdjallah says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That's why it's important to work with patients early on and regularly.</p>



<p>"The earlier you go to curative therapy, the better," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>My elderly mom has recently been told she needs to take a bunch of different medications every day due to her health conditions. It's gotten pretty overwhelming, and I'm worried about things like her missing doses or drug interactions. I just want to make sure she's safe and healthy. Do you have tips on how to handle my mom's meds?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Some older people struggle with remembering to take their medications or organizing them effectively. Adult children, like yourself, can help by taking steps to monitor and update medication lists. Doing this can help prevent potential health complications, while also providing peace of mind for both you and your mom.</p>



<p>The most common medication-related problems in older adults include taking too high or too low of a dose, taking unnecessary medications, not taking medication as directed or at all, taking an ineffective medication, or adverse drug reactions such as confusion, bleeding and oversedation.</p>



<p>In addition, certain medications require special monitoring. Medications used to control pain, anxiety, mood and sleep pose the largest risk for patients as they age. Medications for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/multimedia/vid-20538081?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> also can be problematic if they are not monitored closely and adjusted as health conditions change. </p>



<p>Every person's medication needs are different. The risk for medication-related problems increases with each medication that is added. If your mom takes four or more medications, she has a higher risk for medication-related problems especially falls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are six tips for helping your mom with her medications:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gather information about the medications she uses. </strong><br>Get your mother's up-to-date medication lists from her healthcare team. Make sure that this list matches the prescription containers in her home. Then talk through each medication so both of you fully understand what it is taken for, how often and at what dose.</li>



<li><strong>Contact the pharmacy about available medication management services.</strong> <br>Many pharmacies offer individual dose, or compliance packaging, options. This is a low-cost way to help patients better manage daily medications and it offers a way for family members to double-check on doses that may have been missed. If your pharmacy doesn't offer this service, use a medication planner. This is a plastic organizer that stores scheduled doses of medications and makes it easier to keep on top of which medication to take and when.</li>



<li><strong>Contact the pharmacy about medication synchronization.</strong> <br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/medication-synchronization-increases-prescription-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medication synchronization</a> allows patients to fill most medications at one time every 30 or 90 days, instead of refill cycles scattered throughout the month. This may help simplify and organize medications.</li>



<li><strong>Request access to your mother's medical records. <br></strong>If something goes wrong and your mom needs extra help, having digital access to her <a href="https://onlineservices.mayoclinic.org/content/staticpatient/showpage/patientonline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical records</a> can help you get in touch with her primary care clinician or pharmacist to assist.</li>



<li><strong>Schedule a visit with a pharmacist.</strong> <br>A comprehensive medication review can be scheduled through your mother's primary care clinician's office. You can ask for a referral during a visit or call the scheduling line and ask for a referral. During the visit, a clinical pharmacist will review your parent's medication lists to ensure all the medications are prescribed correctly.</li>



<li><strong>Talk with a pharmacist before adding vitamins and supplements.</strong> <br>Even though these products can be purchased over the counter without a prescription, there are still important interaction concerns with some medications. Talk with a healthcare professional or pharmacist before adding vitamins, herbal remedies or supplements to your mom's medication regimen.</li>
</ul>



<p>As a caregiver, it's important that you take time for self-care and recharging so that you can continue to give. Pay attention to how you feel emotionally and physically. If you need a break or would like assistance, ask family members or other loved ones for help. There are many caregiving resources in the community that can help your mom with needed services or additional support. The best measure of caregiver success is if you did your best with what you had available at that moment. Remember, you don't have to do it alone. <em>— <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/catherine-lea-rph-bcacp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Catherine Lea</strong></a><strong>, Registered Pharmacist, Medication Therapy Management, Mayo Clinic Health System, </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire"><strong>Eau Claire, Wisconsin</strong></a></em></p>

<p>Another common cause of ear pain in children is an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20351616?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ear infection</a>, or otitis media. It's an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/multimedia/img-20515992?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infection of the middle ear</a>, the air-filled space behind the eardrum that contains the tiny vibrating bones of the ear. Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections.</p>



<p>An ear infection is caused by a bacterium or virus in the middle ear. This infection often results from another illness — cold, flu or allergy — that causes congestion and swelling of the nasal passages, throat and eustachian tubes, which are narrow tubes that run from the middle ear to high in the back of the throat.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>The onset of signs and symptoms of ear infection is usually rapid.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms common in children include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ear pain, especially when lying down.</li>



<li>Tugging or pulling at an ear.</li>



<li>Trouble sleeping.</li>



<li>Crying more than usual.</li>



<li>Fussiness.</li>



<li>Trouble hearing or responding to sounds.</li>



<li>Loss of balance.</li>



<li>Fever of 100 F or higher.</li>



<li>Drainage of fluid from the ear.</li>



<li>Headache.</li>



<li>Loss of appetite.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2>



<p>Risk factors for ear infections include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Age.</strong><br>Children between 6 months and 2 years are more susceptible to ear infections because of the size and shape of their eustachian tubes and because their immune systems are still developing.</li>



<li><strong>Group child care.</strong><br>Children cared for in group settings are more likely to get colds and ear infections than children who stay home. The children in group settings are exposed to more infections, such as the common cold.</li>



<li><strong>Infant feeding.</strong><br>Babies who drink from a bottle, especially while lying down, tend to have more ear infections than do babies who are breastfed.</li>



<li><strong>Seasonal factors.</strong><br>Ear infections are most common during the fall and winter. Children with seasonal allergies may have a greater risk of ear infections when pollen counts are high.</li>



<li><strong>Poor air quality.</strong><br>Exposure to tobacco smoke or high levels of air pollution can increase the risk of ear infections.</li>



<li><strong>Alaska Native heritage.</strong><br>Ear infections are more common among Alaska Natives.</li>



<li><strong>Cleft palate.</strong><br>Differences in the bone structure and muscles in children who have cleft palates may make it more difficult for the eustachian tube to drain.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Because ear infections often clear up on their own, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351622?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> may begin with managing pain and monitoring the problem. Sometimes, antibiotics are used to clear the infection. What's best for your child depends on many factors, including your child's age and the severity of symptoms.</p>



<p>Your child's healthcare team may recommend:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>A wait-and-see approach.</strong><br>The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend a wait-and-see approach as one option for:
<ul>
<li>Children 6 to 23 months with mild middle ear pain in one ear for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F.</li>



<li>Children 24 months and older with mild middle ear pain in one or both ears for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Managing pain.</strong><br>Your child's healthcare professional will advise you on treatments to lessen pain from an ear infection. These may include over-the-counter pain medications or anesthetic drops.</li>



<li><strong>Antibiotic therapy.</strong><br>Some evidence suggests that treatment with antibiotics might be helpful for certain children with ear infections. On the other hand, using antibiotics too often can cause bacteria to become resistant to the medicine. Talk with your child's healthcare professional about the potential benefits and risks of using antibiotics. After an initial observation period, your child's healthcare professional may recommend antibiotic treatment for an ear infection in the following situations:
<ul>
<li>Children 6 months and older with moderate to severe ear pain in one or both ears for at least 48 hours or a temperature of 102.2 F.</li>



<li>Children 6 to 23 months with mild middle ear pain in one or both ears for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F.</li>



<li>Children 24 months and older with mild middle ear pain in one or both ears for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Ear tubes.</strong><br>If your child has repeated, long-term ear infections (chronic otitis media) or continuous fluid buildup in the ear after an infection cleared up (otitis media with effusion), your child's healthcare professional may recommend <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ear-tubes/about/pac-20384667?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ear tubes</a> to drain fluid from the middle ear.</li>



<li><strong>Treatment for chronic suppurative otitis media.</strong><br>Chronic infection that results in a hole or tear in the eardrum — called chronic suppurative otitis media — is difficult to treat. It's often treated with antibiotics administered as drops. You may receive instructions on how to suction fluids out through the ear canal before administering drops.</li>



<li><strong>Monitoring.</strong><br>Children who have frequent infections or who have persistent fluid in the middle ear will need to be monitored closely. Talk to your child's healthcare professional about how often you should schedule follow-up appointments. They may recommend regular hearing and language tests.</li>

<p>Winter means the days are shorter and you spend more time indoors where it's warm. But with a lack of sun exposure, are you getting enough vitamin D?</p>



<p>"It comes from the sun in the form of UV light in which your body uses that UV light to help to synthesize, or make, vitamin D," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>But, he says, the sun isn't the only source of vitamin D.</p>



<p>"There are many foods that have vitamin D. Foods also are fortified with it, such as cereals, orange juices and milk have vitamin D. If you get enough from your sources, such as even eating fish such as tuna or salmon, that's an adequate source," says Dr. Bracamonte. "In cases where you don't think you're getting enough, a low-dose vitamin D supplement may be beneficial to help the bone health, help your musculoskeletal health and maybe stave off some additional diseases. Low-dose vitamin D is usually in the general multivitamin. That typically suffices."</p>



<p>He says he recommends taking the supplement in the morning with food.&nbsp;And if you're concerned that you're not getting enough vitamin D, ask your clinician for a simple blood test to check your vitamin D levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Regular <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urine-color/symptoms-causes/syc-20367333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urine color</a> varies but usually ranges from clear to pale yellow. The exact hue depends on how much water you drink. Fluids dilute the yellow pigments in urine. So the more you drink, the clearer your urine looks. When you drink less, the yellow color becomes stronger.</p>



<p>Some foods and medications can change the color of urine. For example, foods like beets, blackberries and fava beans can turn urine pink or red. Some medications also can give urine vivid tones, such as orange or greenish-blue.</p>



<p>An unusual urine color also can be a sign of a health problem, however. For instance, some urinary tract infections can turn urine milky white. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidney stones</a>, some <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancers</a> and other diseases sometimes make urine look red due to blood.</p>



<p>Here are some unusual urine colors, along with things that can cause them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Red or pink urine</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Red urine isn't always a sign of a serious health problem. Red or pink urine can be caused by:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Blood</strong><br>Health problems that can cause blood in the urine include an enlarged prostate, tumors that aren't cancer, and kidney stones and cysts. Vigorous exercise also can cause blood in the urine. Blood in the urine is common in urinary tract infections and with kidney stones. Those problems often cause pain. Painless bleeding might be a sign of a more serious problem, such as cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Foods</strong><br>Beets, blackberries and rhubarb can turn urine red or pink.</li>



<li><strong>Medicines</strong><br>Red or pink urine is possible if you take medications for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tuberculosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tuberculosis</a>, urinary tract pain or constipation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Orange urine</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Orange urine can be caused by:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Medicines</strong><br>Constipation medicines can turn urine orange, as can medicine that lessens swelling and irritation, and some chemotherapy medicines for cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Vitamins</strong><br>Some vitamins, such as A and B-12, can turn urine orange or yellow-orange.</li>



<li><strong>Health problems</strong><br>Orange urine can be a sign of a problem with the liver or bile duct, mainly if you also have light-colored stools. Dehydration also can make your urine look orange.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blue or green urine</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blue or green urine can be caused by:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dyes</strong><br>Some brightly colored food dyes can cause green urine. Dyes used for some kidney and bladder tests can turn urine blue.</li>



<li><strong>Medicines</strong><br>Some medicines for depression, ulcers and acid reflux can turn urine greenish-blue. Medications for pain, arthritis and sleep also can turn urine green.</li>



<li><strong>Health problems</strong><br>A rare disease called familial benign hypercalcemia can cause children to have blue urine. Urinary tract infections caused by a certain bacteria can cause green urine.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dark brown or cola-colored urine</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Brown urine can be caused by:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Foods</strong><br>Eating lots of fava beans, rhubarb or aloe can cause dark brown urine.</li>



<li><strong>Medicines</strong><br>Some medicines can darken urine, including those used to treat and prevent malaria, constipation, high cholesterol and seizures. Some antibiotics and muscle relaxers also can darken urine.</li>



<li><strong>Health problems</strong><br>Some liver and kidney disorders and urinary tract infections can turn urine dark brown. So can bleeding inside the body, called a hemorrhage. A group of illnesses mainly affecting the skin or the nervous system, called porphyria, also can cause brown urine.</li>



<li><strong>Extreme exercise</strong><br>A muscle injury from extreme training can cause tea- or cola-colored urine. The injury can lead to kidney damage.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cloudy or murky urine</h2>



<p>Urinary tract infections and kidney stones can cause urine to look cloudy or murky.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that colors can look slightly different to different people. For instance, what looks red to you might look orange to someone else. Talk with your healthcare team if you have concerns and in particular if you have painful urination or dark orange urine, which can be a sign that your liver isn't working correctly.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My neighbor recently retired, and I've been trying to convince her to volunteer at the library with me. She's not swayed by my stories of feeling good from helping others. Can you share some other benefits of dedicating her time and energy to a cause?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Thank you for volunteering in your community and for trying to persuade your neighbor to join you. Volunteers make an immeasurable difference in people's lives.</p>



<p>The act of volunteering also benefits a person's health as well. Research has shown that volunteering offers significant health benefits, especially for older adults. Here are the top three you can share with your neighbor:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Improves physical and mental health.</strong></h2>



<p>Volunteer activities keep people moving and thinking at the same time. Research has found that volunteering among adults who are 60 and older provided benefits to physical and mental health. Volunteers report better physical health than nonvolunteers. Volunteering leads to lower rates of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20360803?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a>, especially for people 65 and older.</p>



<p>It reduces stress and increases positive, relaxed feelings by releasing dopamine in the brain. By spending time in service to others, volunteers report feeling a sense of meaning and appreciation, both given and received, which can have a stress-reducing effect.</p>



<p>Reduced stress further decreases the risk of some physical and mental health problems, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>, depression, anxiety and general illness. In addition, people who volunteer have lower mortality rates than those who do not, even when controlling for age, sex and physical health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Provides a sense of purpose and teaches valuable skills.</strong></h2>



<p>The work that volunteers provide is essential to everyday activities, giving volunteers a sense of purpose, especially when giving their time and talents in the areas they find meaningful. Older volunteers experience greater increases in life satisfaction and self-esteem.</p>



<p>In addition to volunteering at libraries, schools and food pantries, many people volunteer at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/volunteers?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local hospitals</a>. They serve as greeters and waiting room attendants, provide patient room information and directions, and help transport patients and patient items.</p>



<p>Other volunteers use their craft skills to make prayer shawls, blankets, sweaters and hats that are typically given to newborn babies and patients with cancer. Other services volunteers provide include working in the hospital gift shop, performing clerical duties for staff or offering pet therapy to patients.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Nurture new and existing relationships.</strong></h2>



<p>Volunteering increases social interaction and helps build a support system based on common interests. One of the best ways to make new friends and strengthen existing relationships is to participate in a shared activity. Social circles can shrink in retirement so building or expanding networks can be especially important during this phase of your neighbor's life.</p>



<p>In many cases, volunteers have diverse backgrounds, which helps expand their social network and allows them to practice social skills with others.</p>



<p>As you may have found from your own experience, people are motivated to volunteer for several reasons. They may be exploring careers, sharpening skills, meeting new people, serving their communities or staying active during retirement. Yet all volunteers share a common desire to improve the health and welfare of people in their communities.</p>



<p>The good news is that your neighbor doesn't need to be a philanthropist or senator to enhance or create change in the community. Offer other suggestions if she's not interested in volunteering at the library. Likely, there are a wide variety of volunteer opportunities in your community, whether she's interested in youth, environmental, health, religious or community causes. Encourage her to connect with local nonprofit and cultural organizations, schools, faith communities or hospitals for options.</p>



<p>As you have discovered, volunteering makes an immeasurable difference in people's lives. If your neighbor is open to it, her time and talents can help others and benefit her health at the same time. — <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/angela-thoreson-licsw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Angela Thoreson</em></a><em>, licensed independent clinical social worker, Psychiatry &amp; Psychology, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/austin"><em>Austin, Minnesota</em></a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:00) is in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/SCRIPT-MCM-3-tips-from-Mayo-Clinic-dietitian-about-holiday-indulgence17.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>However you celebrate the holidays, there is likely to be an excess of food at your fingertips. And that usually means lots of sugar and perhaps alcohol.</p>



<p>Delgado says you can manage indulgences during the holidays with these three tips.</p>



<p>"No. 1: Don't choose to go on a diet right before the holidays," she says.</p>



<p>Instead, pay attention to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how much</a>&nbsp;and how often you're eating.</p>



<p>"No. 2: Don't beat yourself up. If you do overindulge, it's OK to make a plan moving forward at the next party, at the next gathering," says Delgado.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Allow yourself to choose different items and portion sizes next time. What you drink matters too.</p>

<p>"No. 3: Stay hydrated. Oftentimes what we neglect most is staying hydrated, and we choose sugary beverages or alcohol, which can add a lot of added calories, empty calories that we can save by drinking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water</a>," she says.</p>



<p>Water should be your main beverage every day, including the holidays</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">More strategies to manage holiday indulgences</h3>



<p><strong>Prioritize physical activity:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Keep physical activity as a priority, even during busy holiday seasons.</li>



<li>Consider morning walks or light exercises before celebrations.</li>



<li>Enjoy the festivities without compromising your health.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Plan ahead for food choices:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Eat something healthy before attending parties to avoid extreme hunger.</li>



<li>Opt for fruits and nuts to curb cravings.</li>



<li>Decide in advance what you'll eat, and focus on healthier options.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Mindful alcohol consumption:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Alcoholic drinks contribute calories and increase hunger.</li>



<li>Alternate alcoholic beverages with low-calorie options, such as carbonated water.</li>



<li>Be mindful of your alcohol intake.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Self-compassion matters:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Don't give up or feel unhappy about managing weight during the holidays.</li>



<li>Be kind to yourself and enjoy the season with a little effort.</li>
</ul>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. – Tis the season of a million errands and shopping trips, and it just so happens to coincide with that time of year when ice and snow begin to impact travel, both in our cars and on foot.</p>



<p>In the north country, a good pair of boots isn't always enough to protect your feet and ankles from injury if you're not careful. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that about 1 million adults in the U.S. are injured due to slips and falls every year, with the injury rate increasing significantly as temperatures decline.</p>



<p>"When it comes to slippery sidewalks and roads, vigilance truly is key," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/taylor-beahrs-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Beahrs, M.D.</a>, an orthopedic surgeon at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato">Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato</a>. "This can be especially true for adults with balance problems, or those who have ankle pain or instability."</p>



<p>So what can you do? Dr. Beahrs recommends the following tips while out running around on the snow and ice.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wear proper footwear.</strong><br>Be sure you have a pair of lightweight boots with good support. You also can purchase snow grips or ice cleats for the bottoms of your shoes or boots for just a few dollars.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Take your time.</strong><br>Do not hurry while walking outside. Pay attention to your steps and walk slowly.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Use assistance.</strong><br>Always use handrails, a walking stick, your walker or cane when out in winter weather.<br><br></li>



<li><strong>Take small steps.</strong><br>Small steps, almost from side to side, help you maintain your center of gravity. Take small steps and waddle a bit like a penguin.<br><br></li>



<li><strong>Stay inside.</strong><br>On days when it is icy and you do not need to go anywhere, stay home.<br><br></li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. Beahrs also recommends that if you do feel yourself falling and cannot regain your balance, don't try to brace your landing with an outstretched arm. That can lead to more injuries. Try to land on your buttock or back.</p>



<p>After a fall, wait for someone to help you in case you are injured or to avoid subsequent falls. Some people further injure themselves by springing up after a fall instead of waiting for help.</p>



<p>"Overall, just use your best judgment on the snow and ice, and take time to assess your path forward before taking steps," says Dr. Beahrs.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>We're thinking about getting a dog. We know they're great companions, but how are they good for your health?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>People with dogs know the benefits of pet ownership. The unconditional love, trust and loyalty shown by your canine companions, coupled with their unbridled enthusiasm on your return home each day, is hard to put into words.</p>



<p>There's another plus of having a dog by your side: It improves your overall physical and mental health. Here's how.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dogs get you moving</strong></h2>



<p>A notable benefit is that dogs force you to get up and move. One research study found that dog owners are more likely to report regular physical activity than people who don't own dogs.</p>



<p>Activities associated with dog ownership, like feeding, grooming, playing and letting them outside, all increase physical activity levels. Physical activity improves blood flow, induces muscle contraction and reduces joint stiffness.</p>



<p>Dogs also require regular exercise and will greet it with smiles and wagging tails. In addition to a typical walk, you can work hiking and running into your outings with your dog depending on its breed. People who regularly perform <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/aerobic-exercise/hlv-20049447">aerobic exercise</a> have improved blood pressure, reduced blood sugar levels, better-controlled weight and a reduced risk of developing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">cardiovascular disease</a>. Other studies have demonstrated that exercise can improve depression and anxiety.</p>



<p>Over time, exercise will help strengthen your muscles, bones and joints. You may notice that your usual route is feeling easier so you decide to stay out longer or walk up that extra hill.</p>



<p>When selecting a new puppy or dog, carefully consider its energy leels and exercise requirements. It's best when your lifestyle and activity levels match that of your canine buddy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dogs help your weight</strong></h2>



<p>Exercise burns calories and helps you maintain a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/healthy-weight">healthy weight</a>. In one&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/your-hearts-best-friend-dog-ownership-associated-with-better-cardiovascular-health/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721">study</a>, adults who regularly walked their dogs were less likely to be obese than their nondog-owning neighbors. The same research found that dog owners also are more likely to report a healthy diet and blood sugar at ideal levels, which improves overall heart health. Walking for 30 minutes a day will reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, colon and breast cancer, and Type 2 diabetes.</p>



<p>That 30 minutes of light-to-moderate dog walking also can help you&nbsp;achieve deeper, more <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ways-to-get-better-sleep">restful sleep</a>. Healthcare professionals recommend adults aim for 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week.</p>



<p>One way to get walking with your new dog is to start a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/get-walking-with-this-12-week-walking-schedule/">12-week walking schedule</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dogs promote social connection</strong></h2>



<p>Owning a dog has been linked to better mental health and a lower perception of social isolation, which can reduce the risk of heart attacks and cognitive issues. Being socially isolated is a strong risk factor for worse health outcomes and premature death. Dog owners interact more with other people, such as other dog owners and people they encounter on walks, and are less likely to experience depression.</p>



<p>Consider training your dog for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/a-day-in-the-life-of-luna-a-facility-dog">pet therapy</a>&nbsp;to gain the dual benefits of connection and volunteering.</p>



<p>For people who work from home, there are four significant ways pets can help with your mental health:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Reducing work-related&nbsp;stress.</strong><br>Two out of 3 employees say work&nbsp;stresses&nbsp;them out, and 40% say their job gets in the way of their health. Pets in the workplace, even at home, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-tips-to-manage-stress">reduce stress</a> and improve employee satisfaction.</li>



<li><strong>Managing anxiety.<br></strong>With the increase in work-from-home jobs, more people are struggling with mental health. Pets can provide the companionship and support once found in the office.</li>



<li><strong>Increasing activity.</strong><br>Dogs give you a reason to go outside, breathe in fresh air and get some physical activity.</li>



<li><strong>Combating&nbsp;loneliness.</strong><br>The bond with pets helps people&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/brushing-off-the-social-rust">feel less alone</a>. Owners can touch, see, hear or talk to their companion animals, which brings happiness, connection and physical contact.</li>
</ul>



<p>There's also&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23642347/">research</a>&nbsp;showing the benefits of animal-assisted therapy during rehabilitation for nervous system conditions, such as strokes, seizure disorders, brain trauma and infections. Dogs can be a valuable part of&nbsp;cardiac rehabilitation,&nbsp;occupational therapy&nbsp;and&nbsp;physical therapy&nbsp;programs. They can provide social support, and trained dogs can even participate in your rehabilitation or therapy sessions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Big decision, win-win solution</strong></h2>



<p>Welcoming a dog into your home is a big decision, and you should carefully consider the responsibilities. However, you also should consider the many wonderful health and emotional benefits that come from of dog ownership.</p>



<p>The bottom line is that a dog can help you be more active and socially connected while improving your overall health<em>.

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart failure is a potentially urgent health concern for young <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-congenital-heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355456?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adults with congenital heart disease</a> (ACHD) that is often overlooked and undertreated, even as hospitalizations for this condition continue to rise. New research from Mayo Clinic shows that young adults in the U.S. living with congenital heart disease are at an increased risk of death or cardiovascular complications after being hospitalized for heart failure. However, study data published in the <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Heart Association</a> also found that patients who had been receiving recent cardiology care before a heart failure hospitalization were less likely to die.</p>



<p>"More than 85% of children born with congenital heart disease reach adulthood. They are likely to experience complications later, yet 61% of these patients beyond the age of 18 do not see a cardiology specialist," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/medical-innovation/burchill-congenital-heart-disease?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke Burchill, M.B.B.S., Ph.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. "These young adult patients have a strong need for individualized care pathways to improve their quality of life and monitor health issues like heart failure."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.118.008775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prior research</a> showed that heart failure hospitalizations of U.S. adults with congenital heart disease increased dramatically from 1998 to 2011. To further understand this trend and its effect on patients and hospital resources, Dr. Burchill and colleagues used national data to study a retrospective cohort of adults with congenital heart disease hospitalized in the past decade. The percentage of ACHD heart failure hospitalizations increased significantly, rising from 6.6% in 2010 to 14% in 2020.</p>



<p>In more than 26,000 unique hospital admissions of ACHD patients, 22% had heart failure and 78% did not. Those admitted with heart failure had a higher risk of death and other major heart and brain complications and used more healthcare resources, including rehospitalization and post-acute care services than those admitted without heart failure. However, people who had a cardiology clinic visit within 30 days prior to hospital admission had lower rates of death due to any causes at the 90-day and 1-year mark.</p>



<p>The ACHD patients with heart failure were nearly twice as likely as those without heart failure to be readmitted to a hospital, especially those under age 45, regardless of their type of congenital heart disease. Younger patients also required more medical or supportive care after they left the hospital before they could return home and care for themselves.</p>



<p>"Many of the patients I meet with ACHD and heart failure share a similar story of not having their heart-related symptoms taken seriously, leading to a delayed recognition and treatment of heart failure. The good news is that we can reset the course for most," says Dr. Burchill. "We have new medications to restrengthen the heart, new options for replacing heart valves without opening the chest, and low-risk treatments for returning heart rhythm to normal. Our goal is to shift the focus from heart failure to heart function and patient success in feeling better and living longer."</p>
