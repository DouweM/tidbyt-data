<p>Growing up as the child of a voice instructor, Emily Hardy developed a lifelong interest in singing. But the third-year student at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine</a> never dreamed her interest in vocals would lead to research related to the first larynx transplant at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"When I first learned that Mayo Clinic was advancing the larynx transplant, I thought the procedure is something that will be exciting for Mayo to be able to do for patients — something I couldn't even fathom," she says. "I knew I wanted to be fully involved in advancing the research in this area."</p>



<p>In addition to her medical degree, Hardy is pursuing a master's degree at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/phd-program/curriculum/career-development-internships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>. Her research project is looking at ways to make the post-laryngeal transplant regimen easier for patients. Because receiving a transplant requires lifelong immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of the new organ, Hardy is investigating removing the cells of a laryngeal transplant model, looking for approaches that reduce the immune response and, hopefully, the need for medication.</p>



<p>"If we can reduce the immune response or the need for immunosuppression that could make laryngeal transplant available to more patients and improve their quality of life," she says.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Voice as a hobby and a scientific study</strong></h2>



<p>Finding joy in singing with others, Hardy participated in a choir in college, and, when she came to medical school at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, she performed with a community-based barbershop group.</p>



<p>"I've always loved anything related to the voice," she says. "When I came to medical school, I'd never thought of incorporating that into my career until I began learning about laryngology and ear nose and throat surgery and realized how those specialties matched that specific interest."</p>



<p>As a medical student also interested in conducting biomedical research, her interest in the intersection of that work and singing would put her at the cutting edge of a brand-new field of study: regenerative sciences. During her first year of medical school, as she sought opportunities to work in a lab, she found <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-00092606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology (ENT) - <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/head-and-neck-cancer-center/sections/overview/ovc-20457072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Surgery</a>/Audiology at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>. His research applies the approaches of regenerative medicine to restoring the voices of patients who have had a laryngectomy — a surgery to remove the voice box.</p>



<p>Regenerative medicine is an approach that shifts the focus from treating disease to rebuilding health by repairing, replacing or restoring damaged tissues, cells or organs.&nbsp;As director of the Head and Neck Regenerative Medicine Lab at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Lott has focused on establishing techniques to regenerate the voice box and restore its abilities after diseases or traumas.</p>



<p>His work led to the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-marks-medical-milestone-with-worlds-first-known-successful-total-larynx-transplant-performed-in-a-patient-with-an-active-cancer-as-part-of-a-clinical-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first laryngeal transplant at Mayo Clinic</a> — actually replacing a damaged voice box with all its necessary functions. People whose voice box was damaged from injury, cancer or the residual effects of radiation treatment — as many as 60,000 people in the U.S. — can neither speak with their natural voices nor breathe through their noses. Mayo Clinic is in the process of establishing the first ongoing larynx transplant program in the country. Dr. Lott and colleagues are advancing the transplant procedure and also exploring other regenerative approaches to larynx restoration, including the use of stem cells and growth factors to help grow functional tissue.</p>



<p>As Hardy learned about the lab's various approaches to laryngeal transplant and the potential to restore function through regenerative sciences, she knew she wanted to contribute to research to further options for voice-impaired patients.</p>



<p>The field of regenerative medicine is so new that few people are versed in its principles and techniques. Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of training the workforce in this emerging field, offering doctoral and post-graduate training in Regenerative Sciences through the <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/graduate-research-education-program-grep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>. Hardy is an example of the future physician-scientists that Mayo is training to deliver the newest regenerative technologies and carry on the work for the next generation.</p>



<p>"Education plays a key role, complementing the research and practice components, in the laryngeal transplant," says Dr. Lott. The entire staff involved in a transplant rehearsed and trained for it, including nurses who underwent specialized in-service training and online courses. Training for the laryngeal transplant provided a unique learning opportunity for residents at<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education</a>, including head and neck surgical resident Payam Entezami, M.D., who assisted the surgical team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address patient needs following the transplant, Hardy found she could amplify her medical school training by pausing it to pursue a master's degree in regenerative sciences, attending classes about its innovative approaches and conducting research in Dr. Lott's lab. She is among Mayo's first students in the program, and says she is impressed by the topics involved — stem cells, tissue engineering, 3D bioprinting — and the vast areas of medicine it touches.</p>



<p>"There are so many different approaches within regenerative medicine and ways to apply it to specific clinical areas of interest," she says.</p>



<p>"We’re educating a specialized clinical workforce of the future, who will have the understanding to manifest the potential held within regenerative medicine," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wyles-saranya-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-20476857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saranya Wyles, M.D., Ph.D.</a> a dermatologist and associate director of education at Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "Regenerative technologies, focused on restoring form and function, have the potential to transform standard of care. The approach begets a new set of skills."</p>



<p>Dr. Lott is enthusiastic that Hardy's research will contribute to the growing information about laryngeal transplant. He's also emphatic about the importance of the various educational opportunities emerging in regenerative medicine.</p>



<p>"We're training the next generation of scientists and clinicians who are going to be pushing the field ahead," he says. "It's one thing to be able to develop regenerative approaches for patients now. It's a whole other to establish the experts in this new field who can help patients for years and years down the road."</p>

<p><em>Surgeons at Mayo Clinic in Arizona perform a total larynx transplant</em></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's unique culture of teamwork and collaboration, hallmarks since the days of Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie Mayo, laid the foundation for Mayo's first larynx transplant that happened February 29 in Arizona. This groundbreaking surgery, only third larynx transplant in the U.S., continues the innovative work for which the Mayo brothers were known.</p>



<p>A team of six surgeons and 20 support staff combined expertise from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/doctors/drc-20424100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Otolaryngology</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;mastery of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Transplantation</a> in an extraordinary 21-hour operation. They transplanted a donor larynx in a 59-year-old patient with cancer whose damaged larynx hampered his ability to talk, swallow and breathe.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">larynx transplant</a> was a composite neck transplant that included at least eight different types of tissue, including the larynx, upper trachea, upper esophagus, pharynx, thyroid glands, parathyroid glands, nerves and blood vessels — commonly called the throat.&nbsp; It's a rare type of transplant known as a vascular composite allograft.&nbsp; The larynx — also called the voice box — is a delicate organ composed of tissue, cartilage and joints that must be able to move after transplantation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A team science approach to larynx transplantation</strong></h2>



<p>This complex surgery is an example of Mayo Clinic's team science approach, to advance research innovation to patient care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic's team science approach made it possible for us to offer this type of a transplant on a scale that was previously unattainable," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-00092606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, chair of the Arizona Department of Otolaryngologist and lead surgeon. "All transplants are complex, but there are more tissue types and moving parts with laryngeal transplantation than other transplants.</p>



<p>In any transplant, the body's immune system flags the donor organ as a foreign object and tries to reject it. A key to success is identifying the right immunosuppressant drugs that allow the body to recognize and accept the new tissue. That was exceptionally challenging in this complex surgery that required eight types of donor tissue. This first transplant will serve as a baseline for understanding the various immune responses, quality of life and long-term sustainability of the larynx transplant.</p>



<p>"Our research laid the foundation for understanding the unique immunosuppressant needs of the patient after transplanting multiple types of tissues," says Dr. Lott. "Preclinical models helped us learn which medications could regulate the immune responses of the various different donor tissue with fewest potential side effects and still be powerful enough to prevent rejection."</p>



<p>This is also the first known larynx transplant in a patient with active cancer who was part of a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03269396?intr=larynx%20transplant&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial.</a> &nbsp;Dr. Lott and the team will now conduct research aimed at establishing scientific evidence to support the first-ever clinical service line in laryngeal transplantation.</p>



<p>"Because this surgery is so rare, there are a lot of unknowns.&nbsp; We will continue our study of laryngeal transplantation in the patient's follow-up care to determine how well the new organ has restored his ability to talk, breathe and eat," says Dr. Lott. "Besides the quality-of-life issues, we want to study how well the transplanted tissues are functioning over time."</p>



<p>The initial focus of the larynx transplant study will be patients who have a voice box that is no longer functional due to previous cancer or traumatic injury. The team is not yet transplanting a donor larynx in a person who has had a total larynx removal — known as a laryngectomy. They hope to use the research to improve this surgery to make it possible for more patients, including those without a larynx, in the near future.</p>



<p>###</p>



<p>Dr. Lott is the chair of the Department of Otolaryngology in Arizona, director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/head-and-neck-regenerative-medicine/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Regenerative Medicine Lab at Mayo Clinic</a>, surgical director of the Larynx and Trachea Transplantation Program, and the associate director of the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> in Arizona.

<p>On Feb. 29, Marty Kedian made history by successfully undergoing a groundbreaking surgery at Mayo Clinic that is providing hope to thousands who have lost their voice and ability to swallow and breathe on their own due to diminished laryngeal function or total loss of their larynx.</p>



<p>This is the third known larynx transplant in the U.S. and the first known case performed on a patient with an active cancer as part of a clinical trial. It is also Mayo Clinic's first total larynx transplant. The multidisciplinary team, including six surgeons, was led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-20055443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. David Lott</a>, chair of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20424084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Otolaryngology (ENT) - Head and Neck Surgery/Audiology at Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>.

<p>Experts say the larynx transplant at Mayo is a pivotal milestone in making the rare procedure available as a scientifically proven, safe and effective procedure for a wider population.</p>



<p>For Marty, it marks the beginning of his quest to break the silence on laryngeal transplantation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Silenced by cancer</strong></h2>



<p>"I love to talk to people everywhere I go," says Marty. "I'm that guy at the baseball game who doesn't know anyone sitting around them. And by the end of the game, I'm friends with everyone in my section."</p>



<p>Marty's world changed in 2013 when he went to the doctor after noticing he was having trouble swallowing his food. "Food was getting caught in my throat. I thought I had allergies. I didn't really think anything of it," recalls Marty.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="909" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-1024x909.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390166" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-1024x909.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-300x266.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-768x682.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-1536x1364.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-2048x1818.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Marty and Gina Kedian</strong> <strong>and their dog Baxter</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>A series of tests revealed Marty had a rare form of laryngeal cancer called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chondrosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chondrosarcoma</a>. Doctors told Marty he needed surgery. "It was a shock," recalls Marty. "It was devastating. I wasn't going to die, but I had a job that required me to talk to people all day long." For 35 years, Marty worked at a local print shop speaking with customers in Haverhill, Massachusetts, where he lives with his wife, Gina, and their family.</p>



<p>Marty underwent his first surgery in 2014. Over the next 10 years, dozens more followed, reducing Marty's voice to a raspy whisper. No longer able to breathe on his own, Marty underwent surgery to have a tracheostomy tube inserted so he could breathe through a hole in the front of his neck.</p>



<p>"Everywhere I went, the first thing people would ask me is, 'How many cigarettes did you smoke a day?' I never smoked a cigarette in my life," says Marty. "People would immediately shut down and back away from me. After a while, I just didn't want to go out anywhere. I was alive, but I wasn't living." Marty was eventually told his last option was a total laryngectomy, or removal of his voice box. He declined. "I didn't want a laryngectomy. I wanted to find a way to get my quality of life back," says Marty.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390142" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Marty with his granddaughter, Charlotte   Photo courtesy: Kedian Family</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I just had my first grandchild. I wanted to be able to talk to her with my own voice, play with her in the yard and take her to baseball games and breathe normally. Gina knew I was already depressed and out of my mind. She kept saying there had to be another way. She went online, and that's when she found Dr. Lott."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding hope at Mayo Clinic</h2>



<p>Thousands of miles from Marty's home, at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Dr. Lott was leading a team of scientists researching laryngeal restoration and transplantation. Dr. Lott is an ear, nose and throat surgeon who specializes in laryngeal surgery. For the past two decades, Dr. Lott and his team have been <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/head-and-neck-regenerative-medicine/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigating ways to restore and save a person's voice and laryngeal function.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="698" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-698x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390168" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-204x300.jpg 204w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-1047x1536.jpg 1047w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116.jpg 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Dr. David Lott discusses laryngeal transplantation with Kedian at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I set my path on becoming a laryngeal surgeon and researcher to build a program that is pushing the boundaries of science forward," explains Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>"Nobody really thinks of their larynx until it's gone," says Dr. Lott. "Then your ability to speak, breathe and swallow is gone, and you are left breathing through a hole in your neck. It is very isolating, and many become a shell of who they used to be. I wanted to find a way to help restore a person's quality of life."</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/preparing-for-mayos-first-larynx-transplant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In 2016, Dr. Lott's program was granted approval to conduct the first clinical trial in the U.S. on laryngeal transplantation</a>. "Until now, laryngeal transplants have been done as on-offs," says Dr. Lott. "This clinical trial allows us to conduct a true scientific investigation aimed at thoroughly researching the safety and efficacy of laryngeal transplantation as a trusted option for patients."</p>



<p>One of the biggest challenges to advancing laryngeal transplantation as an option for cancer patients like Marty has been the risk associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapy. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/11-16-four-ways-organ-transplants-are-being-transformed-to-save-more-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transplant</a> patients are given immunosuppressive drugs to lower the body's immune response, which reduces the risk of organ rejection. However, immunosuppression also increases the risk of the cancer spreading. Marty was already on immunosuppressives due to a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-surgeons-perform-first-robotic-assisted-kidney-transplant-in-minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> years ago.</p>



<p>"Having a patient with an active cancer who already has his own immune suppression allowed us to do the transplant safely without introducing additional risk in a way that has rarely, if ever, been done before," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Girish Mour, M.B.B.S.,</a> medical director of the program.</p>

<p>Removing the cancer was the surgical team's main priority. "First, we removed Mr. Kedian's cancerous larynx," explains Dr. Lott. "Then, with the confidence of our team that the cancer was gone, we focused on the transplant. The entire procedure went better than we expected."</p>



<p>In addition to the larynx, surgeons transplanted the pharynx, upper trachea, upper esophagus, thyroid and parathyroid glands, blood vessels, and nerves.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Marty's road to recovery</strong></h1>



<p>Four months after his transplant, Marty regained 60% of his voice. Doctors say it will continue to improve as he heals over the next year. He has also regained the ability to swallow and breathe on his own. "It is truly amazing," says Marty. "Dr. Lott and the team at Mayo have not only given me my voice back, they've also given me my life back."</p>



<p>Speech and swallow therapy at Mayo has been a significant part of Marty's recovery.</p>



<p>"Marty's progress is remarkable," describes Dr. Lott. "He is eating hamburgers, macaroni and cheese, almost anything with no problem. His breathing also continues to steadily improve." Doctors plan to remove the tracheostomy tube when Marty regains full function of his ability to breathe on his own.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>"The holy grail for managing laryngeal cancer"</strong></h1>



<p>"The case signifies a monumental breakthrough," says Dr. Marshall Strome, who performed the world's first successful larynx transplant in 1998. "It represents the future of laryngeal transplantation where every patient needing a total laryngectomy will have the option of a reconstruction that allows them to maintain their quality of life."</p>



<p>Dr. Lott did some of his early training under Dr. Strome. Since then, Dr. Strome has remained a trusted mentor to Dr. Lott. In a full circle moment, Dr. Strome was present when Dr. Lott performed the transplant at Mayo in February.</p>



<p>"With the clinical trial underway, Dr. Lott and his team are positioned to advance the field in ways no other program can currently achieve. The Mayo team has discovered the holy grail for managing laryngeal cancer, which I believe will come to fruition by the end of this decade," says Dr. Strome.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Breaking the silence on laryngeal transplantation</strong></h1>



<p>Less than five months after surgery, Marty and Gina are excited to return home to Massachusetts. "We couldn't have done this without everyone's love and support," says Gina.</p>



<p>"I will always be grateful to the team at Mayo and especially for the generosity of my organ donor and the donor family," says Marty.</p>



<p>Dr. Lott's clinical trial is approved to perform additional larynx transplants in the coming years.</p>



<p>Marty is looking forward to doing what he loves most — talking to family, friends and everyone else he meets. He is especially looking forward to talking with his granddaughter, Charlotte.</p>



<p>"I will be reading her lots of bedtime stories," says Marty. Meanwhile, Marty also is planning to share his own story to inspire others.</p>



<p>"My first job is to get better," says Marty. "My next job will be to tell everyone they can do it too."</p>

<p>PHOENIX — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> announces a groundbreaking achievement in organ transplantation, offering hope to thousands who have lost their ability to speak, swallow and breathe on their own due to diminished function or loss of their larynx. A multidisciplinary team of doctors in Arizona performed the third known total larynx transplant in the U.S. The case also marks a medical milestone as the first known total larynx transplant performed as part of a clinical trial and the first on a patient with active cancer in the U.S.</p>



<p>"The surgery and patient's progress have exceeded our expectations," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-20055443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology (ENT) - <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/head-and-neck-cancer-center/sections/overview/ovc-20457072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Surgery</a>/Audiology at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>. "This is a tremendous accomplishment in launching what we believe is the future for laryngeal transplantation."</p>



<p>A paper by Dr. Lott on the case was published July 9 in the peer-reviewed medical journal <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/jmcp/Lott-1720450777830.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>. The larynx, located in the throat, is commonly known as the voice box. Larynx transplantation is a rare and complex procedure, performed only a handful of times in the world. Even more notably, Mayo Clinic's surgical team successfully performed the larynx transplant on a patient with an active cancer, making it one of the first cases of its kind globally.</p>



<p>Six surgeons at Mayo Clinic conducted the 21-hour transplant, which included the larynx, pharynx, upper trachea, upper esophagus, thyroid and parathyroid glands, blood vessels, and nerves.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a> was performed on a Massachusetts man, Marty Kedian, who was diagnosed with a rare form of laryngeal cancer called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chondrosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chondrosarcoma</a>. For 10 years, Kedian underwent dozens of surgeries, which eventually robbed him of his voice and his ability to swallow and breathe normally. Several years ago, Kedian had to undergo a tracheostomy that allowed him to breathe through a hole in his neck. He says the tracheostomy, combined with the loss of his voice, significantly diminished his quality of life. "I was alive, but I wasn't living," says Kedian. "I love to talk to people everywhere I go, and I just couldn't. I felt strange, and I wouldn't go out anywhere."</p>



<p>After years of surgeries, doctors told Kedian his only remaining option was to get a laryngectomy and have his larynx completely removed. He declined. "I didn't want a laryngectomy. I wanted to find a way to get my quality of life back," he says.</p>



<p>Kedian found what he was looking for at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Larynx and Trachea Transplant Program</a>, where Dr. Lott was leading the first known clinical trial on laryngeal transplantation in the U.S. After being accepted as a patient for the clinical trial, Kedian and his wife, Gina, moved to a temporary home in Phoenix. On Feb. 29, Kedian became Mayo Clinic's first patient to undergo a total larynx transplant. "I wanted this so I could talk and breathe normally with my new granddaughter. I want to read her bedtime stories with my own voice," says Kedian.</p>



<p>Because it was conducted as part of a clinical trial, Mayo's case is considered a significant pivotal step in making the rare procedure available to a wider population. "Until now, laryngeal transplants have been done as one-offs," says Dr. Lott. "This clinical trial allows us to conduct a true scientific investigation aimed at thoroughly researching the safety and efficacy of laryngeal transplantation as a trusted option for patients." The program is approved to perform additional larynx transplants in the coming years.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cancer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a> estimates there will be 12,650 new cases of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laryngeal cancer</a> in the U.S. this year. Until now, many of these patients had little hope of laryngeal transplantation as a possible option in the future due to the risk associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapy. Transplant patients are given immunosuppressive therapy to lower the body's immune response, which reduces the risk of organ rejection. However, immunosuppressive drugs also increase the risk of the cancer spreading.</p>



<p>Kedian's case was unique. He was already on immunosuppressive therapy from a previous kidney transplant. "Having a patient with an active cancer who already had his own immune suppression allowed us to do the transplant safely without introducing additional risk in a way that has rarely, if ever, been done before," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Girish Mour,</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M.B.B.S.</a>, medical director of the program. Dr. Lott adds, "Being able to perform this transplant in the setting of active cancer in a patient already on immunosuppressive therapy, under the rigor and oversight of a clinical trial, enabled us to take that vital step toward better understanding the safety for cancer patients and potentially making larynx transplant a standard option."</p>



<p>Removing the cancer was the surgical team's main priority. "First, we removed Mr. Kedian's cancerous larynx," explains Dr. Lott. "Then, with the confidence of our team that the cancer was gone, we focused on the transplant."</p>



<p>Four months after surgery, Kedian can speak with his new voice, swallow and breathe on his own, which Dr. Lott calls remarkable. "Mr. Kedian has already regained about 60% of his voice, which I wouldn't have thought would happen for at least a year. He still speaks with the same voice and Boston accent he had prior to the cancer," says Dr. Lott. "He can also eat hamburgers, macaroni and cheese, almost anything, and swallow with no problem. His breathing also continues to steadily improve." Doctors plan to remove the tracheostomy tube when Kedian regains full ability to breathe on his own.</p>



<p>"The team at Mayo has given me my life back," says Kedian. "I'm so grateful. I have the deepest gratitude for Dr. Lott's team and especially the generosity of my organ donor and donor family. I hope one day I get the chance to tell them, 'Thank you.'"</p>



<p>"This case signifies a monumental breakthrough. It represents the future of laryngeal transplantation, where every patient needing a total laryngectomy will have the option of a reconstruction that allows them to maintain their quality of life," says Marshall Strome, M.D., who made medical history by performing the world's first total laryngeal transplant in 1998. "With the clinical trial underway, Dr. Lott and his team are positioned to advance the field in ways no other program can currently achieve. The Mayo team has discovered the holy grail for managing laryngeal cancer, which I believe will come to fruition by the end of this decade."</p>



<p>Dr. Lott calls Kedian's case the capstone of his two decades of research. In addition to the clinical trial, Dr. Lott's research team is investigating ways to restore laryngeal function through improving transplantation techniques and pioneering <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/head-and-neck-regenerative-medicine/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative medicine technologies</a>. "I set my path on becoming a laryngeal surgeon and researcher to build a program that is pushing the boundaries of science forward," says Dr. Lott. "Our dedication is to the thousands of individuals who suffer from laryngeal dysfunction and to find trusted options that preserve their health and their quality of life. That's what this clinical trial is all about."</p>



<p>Kedian returns to Massachusetts next week. He is excited to be back with family and friends and to read bedtime stories to his granddaughter. Kedian also plans to use his own story to inspire others and be a voice for hope. "Mayo and Dr. Lott have helped me regain my quality of life," says Kedian. "My job now is to get better. My next job will be to show others they can do it too."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heavy rain and wind didn’t deter a group of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center staff on Monday, June 17 who joined a group of bicyclists raising awareness about the need for living organ donation.</p>



<p>A half-dozen Mayo staff pedaled from southwest Rochester to the Mayo Building in a show of support for “The Organ Trail,” a long-distance bike ride focused on bringing attention to the need for living kidney donors. Husband-and-wife duo Mark and Lynn Scotch founded the nonprofit series of long-distance bike rides following their own experiences as living kidney donors. Mark is also a living liver donor. The Rochester stop is part of a 1,173-mile, 3-week long ride that kicked off in their hometown of Plover, Wis. Mark does the cycling and Lynn helps support the team on the road.</p>



<p>Among those joining in the bike ride was Mayo Clinic Transplant Center Director <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heimbach-julie-k-m-d/bio-20054676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Heimbach, M.D.</a> Standing before a row of journalists at a media availability, Dr. Heimbach explained why living donation is so critically important.</p>



<p>“At Mayo Clinic, we are all-in on living donation. We definitely believe it is the best way to get people off dialysis, potentially even having a transplant before they need to go on dialysis,” Heimbach said. “We are one of the largest living donor kidney programs in the country. And we’re so delighted to be able to support your ride.”</p>



<p>Dr. Heimbach presented both Mark and Lynn Scotch with gifts, including a Mayo Clinic cycling jersey for Mark Scotch.</p>



<p>The event featured another special surprise. Katelyn Thompson brought her 3-year-old son Cooper Thompson to welcome the cyclists to campus. Cooper received a kidney transplant thanks to Lynn Scotch donating a kidney to a stranger on his behalf.</p>



<p>"We were so astonished when we learned things like 13 people die every day in this country waiting for a kidney transplant. I guess we just thought everybody that needed an organ got one. And that's sadly not the case at all,” Lynn Scotch said. “So we figured if we don't know this, there must be lots of other people that don't know this and might step forward as well. And so began our journey.”</p>

The findings also show that the surgical weight-loss procedure reduced cardiovascular risks, including diabetes and hypertension.</p>



<p>"In earlier research, we found that conservative weight-loss approaches do not adequately result in significant weight loss in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kukla-aleksandra-m-d/bio-20241280?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aleksandra Kukla, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant nephrologist and the study's first author. "These new findings support the value of surgical gastrectomy for patients with advanced chronic kidney failure, stage 4-5D, to improve general health and access to kidney transplantation."</p>



<p>The retrospective study involved 104 patients with advanced chronic kidney failure and obesity who were treated at Mayo Clinic between 2020 and 2023. Fifty-four underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, the most frequently performed surgical weight-loss procedure in patients seeking kidney transplant, and 50 patients opted for a nonsurgical weight-loss approach.</p>



<p>Undergoing sleeve gastrectomy reduced the time for patients to be added to waiting lists for kidney transplantation. It also improved the likelihood of receiving a transplant, with 37% of those who underwent sleeve gastrectomy receiving a transplant within 18 months, versus 10% in the nonsurgical cohort.</p>



<p>The risk of postsurgical complications was low, and the rate of hospitalizations and infections for patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy was similar to the nonsurgical cohort.</p>



<p>Effective therapy for obesity among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is understudied, in part because high <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/in-depth/bmi-calculator/itt-20084938?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">body mass index (BMI)</a> is often considered beneficial in patients receiving <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/dialysis-programs/overview/ovc-20464948?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney dialysis</a>. "Treatment of obesity in this population has been limited to nonsurgical options in the past," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tayyab Diwan, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon and co-author of the study.</p>

<p>In 2020, just as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a> was breaking throughout the world, 60-year-old Gerald (Gerry) Polcari had a sudden <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gallstones/symptoms-causes/syc-20354214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gallstone attack</a> that blocked his biliary system. In addition to experiencing extreme pain, Gerry's kidney and liver began to fail. He went into septic shock and eventually necrotizing pancreatitis. Gerry had previously enjoyed a healthy life with no symptoms or warning signs that anything was wrong. After four months in a Boston-area hospital without family being able to visit due to COVID-19 restrictions, his doctors were unable to determine why he was not recovering. However, they were able to determine he had suffered irreparable damage to the biliary system of his liver. He would eventually be diagnosed with a rare condition called secondary sclerosing cholangitis, which results from a loss of oxygen to the liver.</p>



<p>Gerry would learn that the only treatment for his condition would be a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant</a>. "I was, of course, incredulous when they told me that the only treatment was a liver transplant," says Gerry. "How could this have happened to me? I was living my best life — both personally and professionally. I had signed up as an organ donor when I originally got my license at age 16, but never in a thousand years expected to have to be on the receiving end of an organ transplant."</p>



<p>Gerry was listed for a transplant in Boston in September 2020, and he remained critically ill because his liver could not clear toxins. He was hospitalized every six to eight weeks throughout 2020 and 2021 with recurring sepsis, frequently undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures (ERCP) to clear out his biliary system.</p>



<p>"I was on a first-name basis with many of the doctors and technicians in the ERCP process," he says. "Due to my extended hospitalization, I had lost over 50 pounds and eventually was on a feeding tube for nearly one year. Needless to say, it was not an experience I would wish on anyone."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="893" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari2-893x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-386441" style="aspect-ratio:16/9;object-fit:cover;width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari2-893x1024.jpg 893w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari2-262x300.jpg 262w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari2-768x881.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari2.jpg 933w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" /></figure>



<p>As a result of the recurring sepsis and biliary issues, Gerry became increasingly antibiotic-resistant from repeated treatment for sepsis, and in June of 2021, his medical team in Boston was concerned that they were running out of antibiotics to treat him. They feared he could die from an infection. The doctors recommended that he and his family consider being evaluated at other transplant centers where the average Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at transplant was lower than it was in New England, thereby improving his odds for a lifesaving liver transplant. His infectious diseases physician in Boston highly recommended he transfer to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> to be evaluated and seek another opinion.</p>



<p>Gerry and his family arrived in Florida for an evaluation in July of 2021. "My wife had to push me through the airport in a wheelchair — that’s how weak I was," he recalls. "I was very much afraid that I would never physically recover and would be an invalid for the remainder of my life. But arriving here and looking around, we were immediately struck by the natural beauty of northern Florida. After a few weeks, I started to notice that my health improved marginally because I was able to be more physically active — walking on the beach primarily."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic accepted Gerry into the transplant program in August 2021. That was when he and his wife decided to relocate to Florida so that he could continue to be active outdoors, especially in contrast to the cold winters up north. He waited about seven months for the final call that resulted in his liver transplant in February 2022.</p>



<p>"During my nearly two years of serious illness, I received seven calls for possible transplant," says Gerry. "It was an emotional process to have our hopes dashed six times. But the seventh call was the charm, and I am forever grateful for my donor's and their family's decision to donate their loved one's organs."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari3-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-386442" style="aspect-ratio:16/9;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari3-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari3-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari3-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari3-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Today, Gerry says he is "doing amazingly well, better than ever anticipated."</p>



<p>"I had experienced such a catastrophic illness that damaged everything in my body that I feared I would remain incapacitated for the remainder of my life," he says. "I am happy to report that my new liver is working well, and over the past two years, I have gradually recovered my physical health."</p>



<p>In addition to his transplant, Gerry credits the care he received at Mayo Clinic and its atmosphere with saving his life. "I have such respect for the Mayo philosophy — of healing the whole person," he says. "The artwork, gardens and occasional piano music are so peaceful. The facilities are state-of-the-art, and I always had the sense that all the staff — from the cleaning people to the transplant surgeons — always had my best interests at heart. The care of my Mayo doctors and nurses was exemplary, and the utmost attention was given to my incredibly complicated case."</p>



<p>It was not just the hospital staff that had an impact on Gerry and his recovery. He also gained a sense of community and purpose from fellow liver transplant patients before and after his transplant.</p>



<p>"I was immediately connected to a liver transplant support group that continues to be a source of purpose for me," says Gerry. "I met others who were thriving after their transplants, which inspired me during some dark days. As we joke amongst ourselves, we are all members of a club we never asked to join. I continue to be involved and pay it forward by helping people new to the group and in that same frightening and lonely place."</p>



<p>Following his transplant, Gerry vowed to give back to Mayo Clinic through volunteer work. Before returning to full-time work, he volunteered on the transplant floor as a nurse aide, restocking supplies and cleaning nursing stations, among other tasks. Through his volunteering, he was able to reconnect with some of the people who took care of him. "That was incredibly heartening to be able to thank them in person for all they did for me," says Gerry. He also volunteers with LifeQuest Organ Recovery Services doing tabling events and speaking at various programs about his transplant experience.</p>



<p>"Our goal is to try to get people to sign up as organ donors as there is such a shortage nationally of healthy organs and over 100,000 people just like me — incredibly sick, with no treatment options other than an organ transplant," says Gerry. "Additionally, I have remained involved in the Second Chance Support Group, offering my perspective to pretransplant patients, and offering to meet them in person if they are local so they can see with their own eyes that it's possible to regain good health and an amazing quality of life. I never actually believed that would ever be possible again for me, but yet, here I am, forever grateful for having my own second chance at life."</p>

<p>This <a href="https://donatelife.net/news/april-is-national-donate-life-month/">Donate Life Month</a>, Gerry encourages others to consider giving someone a second chance at life by becoming an organ donor. "I would say that it is the last gift you can bestow on the world, a gift that means a second chance to a very sick patient and their family," he says. "Because of my donor, I have lived to not only regain my good health, but to continue on my life's journey. In January, I welcomed my first grandchild into this world — something that I was not sure I would ever live to see. No words can describe how incredibly grateful I am for my donor's final act of generosity."</p>

<p>Each April, the country celebrates <a href="https://donatelife.net/how-you-can-help/national-observances-celebrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donate Life Month</a>, an observance to raise awareness about the importance of organ donation, celebrating donors' incredible generosity and inspiring others to consider becoming organ donors. It is also a time to celebrate the unique contributions transplant nurses make to the lives of their patients. Inspired by her work and her mother, Stephanie Donelan, a post-liver transplant coordinator at Mayo Clinic in Florida, gave her role as a transplant nurse new meaning by becoming an altruistic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-kidney-transplant/pyc-20384838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living kidney donor</a>.</p>



<p>"I decided to be a living kidney donor because of my exposure to the world of transplant," says Stephanie. "Working with the transplant team, I've had the opportunity to see the need that there is for organ transplants. I know there are plenty of people on the waiting list who don't get an organ. We deal with people who have been really sick, either very acutely or for a really long time, and it's pretty incredible to get to see people with a new lease on life."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In addition to her work and the patients she serves, Stephanie's mother also inspired her decision.</p>



<p>"My mom was diagnosed with early-onset dementia," she shares. "I think, as someone who has had a loved one with a chronic health condition and feeling kind of helpless to do anything, it put me in a position where, when there was an opportunity to make a difference, I felt pretty motivated."</p>



<p>There are nearly 90,000 people on the waiting list for a kidney transplant in the U.S. Unfortunately, the demand for kidneys exceeds the supply. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-a-living-donor-chain/">Living donor chains</a> are giving hope to those in need of vital organs.</p>



<p>"A living kidney donor chain is when someone altruistically donates a kidney, meaning donates a kidney with not a specific individual in mind, that can start a chain effect of donors," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463">Dr. Shennen Mao</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Stephanie Donelan sitting up in a hospital bed reading a book.." class="wp-image-386255" style="width:464px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1.jpg 1331w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>"Stephanie's story is an incredibly motivating story," says Dr. Mao. "We have somebody who has really given her career to transplant as a nurse taking care of patients, and then to be motivated to donate a kidney to start a chain and influence the lives of complete strangers going forward — I think her story is just incredible, really practicing what we preach in the transplant community."</p>



<p>Stephanie credits her colleagues and care team, including other transplant nurses, for putting her mind at ease and supporting a quick recovery. "I think because I had so much trust in my care team here I really didn't feel nervous," she says. "I felt very confident in my decision to donate. The level of attention here at Mayo Clinic is really unique."</p>

<p>"I think my mom would be really proud of my kidney donation," says Stephanie. "The values she instilled in me from the time of my childhood is carrying on."</p>

<p>"We would like people to consider living kidney donation because it saves lives. We can get people better matched kidneys through a larger pool of donors," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>He says a common misconception is that a kidney donor needs to be a first-degree relative.</p>



<p>"Anyone can be a living kidney donor and does not need to be relative. It can be unrelated, can be an acquaintance or can be anyone," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>Another myth is the donor kidney needs come from a person of the same race.</p>



<p>"A kidney is a kidney. It doesn't matter whatever race you are; you should consider living kidney donation," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>He says if you're worried that you might be too old to donate, you shouldn't. If you're healthy and over 18, you might be a match.</p>



<p>"In general, we typically say up to 70 years, but, in fact, there is no age limit for living kidney donation," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>Up until recently, anyone with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 2 diabetes</a> was ruled out as a living donor. But now, based on certain health requirements, some of those candidates may be eligible.</p>



<p>"By expanding the criteria to allow more individuals with type 2 diabetes to be potential donors, we can close the gap between the high demand for organs and the need for kidney transplants," says Dr. Issa.</p>

<p>"Couldn't really do a whole lot. You know, just was tired all the time. Lost my breath doing anything, you know, stuff like that. Just couldn't keep up with everyday life," Britiny says.</p>



<p>A trip back to Mayo in early 2023 uncovered the problem. "She developed a very serious lung infection called scedosporium, which is very, very difficult to treat. And, unfortunately, it led to a decline in her lung function," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/saddoughi-sahar-m-d-ph-d/bio-20533719?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sahar Saddoughi</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon.</p>

<p>The good news is that Britiny's new heart remained strong. The bad news is that once the fungal infection is in the lungs, it's very hard to get rid of. Dr. Saddoughi says she knew they needed to approach Britiny's case differently. "Can we just retransplant her lungs, keep her heart there and then treat her with very potent antifungals to try to get rid of that infection?" Dr. Saddoughi asked her team.</p>



<p>But would it work? As they investigated, Dr. Saddoughi and her team found one other case reported in medical literature, but even that wasn't exactly the same. She says another question mark was connecting the new lungs to the trachea.</p>



<p>"When she had that initial transplant, her connection to the donor lung was at the level of the trachea. But for just a lung transplant, now you're doing the connection lower. And that was one of the surgical challenges or concerns that we had," says Dr. Saddoughi.</p>



<p>But the decision was made to go ahead. Britiny says she had mixed feelings.</p>



<p>"I was scared. Because the first time, I didn't know what to expect. And then this time was, I knew. But yeah, it was just scary — but exciting too," says Britiny.</p>



<p>In March of 2023, Britiny underwent her second double-lung transplant. At a recent follow-up appointment, Dr. Saddoughi shared that the lungs were working fine, and the infection was gone. She credits the way that different teams worked so well together.</p>



<p>"What's great about Mayo is that we have so much expertise in all the different areas, which is how we can do cases like this — so our lung transplant pulmonology team, our infectious diseases team, all the people that are working in the hospitals to really help us through the surgery and her postoperative and preoperative care. It's really critical for the success of our patients," says Dr. Saddoughi.</p>

<p>While the start of football season is still a few months away, Britiny says she has been tracking her teams. "I know what's going on all the time — let's just put it that way — even on offseason," she says.</p>



<p>She adds that she is looking forward to cheering her teams on, including her team at Mayo.</p>



<p>"I can't thank everyone enough — I mean nurses, doctors, everything," Britiny says.</p>
