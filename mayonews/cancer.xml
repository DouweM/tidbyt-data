<p>Today in the U.S., 7.2 % of adults identify as LGBTQ+ — that's more than 24 million people who often face stigma and discrimination that can make navigating the healthcare system difficult.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/cathcart-rake-elizabeth-j-m-d/bio-20558812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Cathcart-Rake, M.D.</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;medical oncologist specializing in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>, wants to change that. She's launched the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, to support the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, gender diverse and intersex (LGBTQ+) people with or at risk for breast cancer. She is also researching how to improve their cancer care experiences and outcomes.</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center Blog team spoke with Dr. Cathcart-Rake about the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic. Here's what she wants people to know about the clinic and the LGBTQ+ cancer care experience:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meeting the unique needs of LGBTQ+ people</h2>



<p>People who identify as LGBTQ+ experience significant disparities in cancer care, including higher rates of late-stage diagnoses, poorer cancer outcomes, and side effects from therapy that go unaddressed.</p>



<p>"I am interviewing folks who talk about getting surgeries on their nose and having their surgical team not feel comfortable getting them dressed after surgery because of their gender identity and gender expression. These types of experiences, to me, are heartbreaking," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<p>Dr. Cathcart-Rake says LGBTQ+ people are less likely to be offered fertility preservation before cancer treatment and often have unaddressed sexual side effects from treatment. For transgender and gender-diverse people, she says there are questions and concerns about the interaction between hormone therapy, gender-affirming and cancer-specific surgeries.</p>



<p>Opening the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic is personal for Dr. Cathcart-Rake. "I have a dear friend who came out and experienced unbelievable discrimination and stigma. That experience has fueled this — thinking through what they've gone through every step of the way. Our role is to care for the person in front of us, no matter what."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Offering cancer care services in a supportive, affirming environment</h2>



<p>The Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic team provides specialty, multidisciplinary and person-affirming care for LGBTQ+ individuals in a safe and respectful environment while optimizing physical, emotional and social health.</p>



<p>"At every point on their cancer care journey, we want patients to see clinic staff who are excited and happy to see them and know the affirming, culturally appropriate language to use. To support that environment, we have posted LGBTQ–welcoming signage throughout the clinic, wear rainbow pins on our badges, and offer gender-neutral bathrooms," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<p>The team includes Dr. Cathcart-Rake and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/tevaarwerk-amye-j-m-d/bio-20527633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amye Tevaarwerk, M.D.</a>, another medical oncologist specializing in breast cancer. Jamie Carroll, a nurse practitioner; Gina Schultz, a registered nurse; and Nicole Sintler, a social worker, are also on the team. All team members are trained in providing care for LGBTQ+ people. The team also consults with a breast surgeon and a radiation oncologist with similar training.</p>



<p>"LGBTQ+ people experience so much discrimination and stigma — in everyday life and healthcare experiences. They deserve spaces like this where they're welcomed and supported and receive equitable healthcare," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake. "We hope this is just a starting point, and we can expand to other cancer types and subspecialties."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting research to improve cancer care for LGBTQ+ people</h2>



<p>Dr. Cathcart-Rake says research is needed to help healthcare professionals understand the cancer care disparities LGBTQ+ people experience. "We know there are inequities and aspects of their cancer care we're not addressing. But there's little data to better understand those needs and how we can improve outcomes," she says.</p>



<p>Research will be central to the Rainbow Breast Cancer Clinic's purpose. "That's going to be a huge part of this clinic — to better understand and identify LGBTQ+ peoples' needs and work collaboratively with patients and advocates to address them," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<p>Patients will be asked to complete surveys about their care experiences and symptoms to support this research. Information from these surveys will be used to continuously improve clinical care and to develop clinical trials focused on the needs of LGBTQ+ people related to breast cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to make an appointment</h2>



<p>Housed on the 10th Floor of the Gonda Building on Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minnesota, the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic is open to anyone who wishes to be seen in an LGBTQ–focused breast clinic.</p>



<p>To make an appointment, call the Medical Oncology Appointment Office in Rochester, Minnesota, at 507-284-8815 and mention "Rainbows."</p>



<p>Virtual visits will be allowed for any patient, as laws allow.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A generous $20 million gift from Dwight and Dian Diercks will fuel key elements of Mayo Clinic’s vision for the future of healthcare, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform</a> and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for early detection and intervention in cancer. In honor of their support, Mayo Clinic will establish the Dwight and Dian Diercks President, Mayo Clinic Platform, and create the Heidi Diercks Krause Fund in AI Innovation for Cancer, named in honor of Mr. Diercks’ late sister.</p>



<p>"The Dierckses’ visionary investment will bolster Mayo Clinic’s efforts through the Platform to curate the world's de-identified data, empower solution developers and transform healthcare around the world," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/our-team/john-d-halamka-md-ms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Halamka, M.D.</a>, the inaugural Dwight and Dian Diercks President, Mayo Clinic Platform.</p>



<p>“Through the reach of Mayo Clinic Platform, the Dierckses’ remarkable generosity will accelerate new innovations that fundamentally change how health systems and care teams provide care to improve patients' lives,” says Dr. Halamka, who also holds the Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President’s Strategic Initiative Professorship.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Platform is a key focus of Mayo Clinic’s Bold. Forward. strategy to transform healthcare globally. Disrupting the traditional pipeline paradigm, Mayo Clinic Platform brings together solution developers, data partners and healthcare organizations to collaborate around secure, de-identified clinical data to create, validate and scale digital health solutions. It currently offers access to a diverse dataset of 46 million de-identified and longitudinal patient records, AI model validation for accuracy and removal of bias, and streamlined clinical integration. This transformative model is expediting a new era of revolutionary diagnostics and treatments that redefine the frontiers of patient care and well-being.</p>



<p>The Heidi Diercks Krause Fund in AI Innovation for Cancer will enable Mayo Clinic’s Generative Artificial Intelligence Program and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> to advance answers for cancer. An example of this work includes developing advanced generative AI tools to gain deep insights into a person’s risk of developing cancer. This forecasting will allow clinicians to intervene earlier than ever before — even before cancer can be diagnosed.</p>



<p>“We are profoundly grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Diercks for their support, which will help us bring the promise of AI to patients at the earliest phases of their care journeys,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/callstrom-matthew-r-m-d-ph-d/bio-00085927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Callstrom, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic’s medical director for Strategy, chair of Radiology in Rochester and leader of the Generative Artificial Intelligence Program. “Cancer affects people from all walks of life, and leveraging AI to tackle and treat this devastating disease will be critical for improving outcomes for all patients.”</p>



<p>As senior vice president of software engineering at NVIDIA, Mr. Diercks has been involved in AI innovation since the company’s inception.</p>



<p>“We can't afford to wait years or decades for new AI breakthroughs in healthcare. People need new therapies and cures now,” says Mr. Diercks. “Dian and I truly believe that Mayo Clinic Platform and AI innovation will be the keys to better predicting diseases like cancer, so physicians can intervene sooner with more effective treatments that save, extend or improve the quality of patient lives. It gives me comfort knowing my sister’s legacy will live on through these efforts to transform cancer care for everyone. Heidi lived for her family, and having additional time with her husband, Scott, and daughter, Kate, meant the world to her.&nbsp;In the future, we hope that extension of time can be amplified tenfold for others.”</p>



<p>Mr. Diercks grew up in Red Wing, Minnesota, less than 50 miles from Mayo Clinic’s Rochester campus, where he worked on his family’s farm as a teenager. His close family, including his late father and sister, trusted Mayo Clinic for their most complex health needs.</p>



<p>“I tell my friends that receiving care at Mayo Clinic is like being at the intersection of medicine and hardcore engineering. Everyone is focused on finding the right tests and data to solve the most personal, important health challenges in your life,” says Mr. Diercks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. Diercks earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering with a minor in business from the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). The Dierckses have provided transformational support to MSOE that has resulted in a nation-leading computer science program in applied AI and supercomputing. With their latest gift to Mayo Clinic, they aim to provide the same accelerant to AI innovation, now within healthcare.</p>

<p>Black people are more likely to die from prostate, lung and breast cancer than other races. Dr. Barbel Johnson says there are many contributing factors, including genetics, habits and other mitigating circumstances.</p>



<p>"It has a lot to do with the structural racism that has created the environment, not only for access but for prioritizing and evolving treatments," says Dr. Barbel Johnson.</p>



<p>The family medicine physician says regular cancer screenings are key to increasing survival rates.</p>



<p>"It's important that we prioritize those things where we're seeing the incidence and the death rates are highest in these populations to be screened for those conditions," says Dr. Barbel Johnson.</p>



<p>Knowing your family history, regular exercise and eating a healthy diet are also crucial to cutting cancer risks.</p>



<p>"In doing so, we will then decrease things like red meat, increase things like vegetables within our diet, decrease the amounts of sugar and artificial sweeteners that we have in our diet," she says.</p>



<p>She also recommends stopping tobacco use and getting adequate sleep.</p>

<p>It's that time of year when everyone's looking forward to some fun in the sun. Too much sun can be dangerous, though. Exposure to UV radiation from the sun damages your skin, and children are especially vulnerable because they tend to spend more time outdoors and can burn easily.</p>



<p>Skin damage from the sun increases your risk of developing:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Skin cancer</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20377605?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skin cancer</a> develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms, hands and legs.&nbsp;Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions. Skin cancer occurs when mutations occur in the DNA of skin cells. Much of the damage to DNA in skin cells results from UV radiation found in sunlight and in the lights used in tanning beds.</li>



<li><strong>Wrinkles</strong><br>Although genetics mainly determine skin structure and texture, sun exposure is a major cause of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wrinkles/symptoms-causes/syc-20354927?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrinkles</a>, especially for people with light skin. Exposure to&nbsp;UV&nbsp;light breaks down your skin's connective tissue — collagen and elastin fibers, which lie in the deeper layer of skin. Without the supportive connective tissue, your skin loses strength and flexibility. Skin then begins to sag and wrinkle prematurely.</li>



<li><strong>Age spots</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/age-spots/symptoms-causes/syc-20355859?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age spots</a> are caused by overactive pigment cells. UV light speeds up the production of melanin, a natural pigment that gives skin its color. On skin that has had years of sun exposure, age spots appear when melanin becomes clumped or is produced in high concentrations. Use of commercial tanning lamps and beds also can cause age spots.</li>
</ul>



<p>One way to protect your skin is to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor, or SPF, of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring. Use a generous amount of sunscreen on all exposed skin, including your lips, the tips of your ears, and the backs of your hands and neck.</p>



<p>Sunscreens are required by the Food and Drug Administration to remain at their original strength for at least three years. This means that you can use leftover sunscreen from one year to the next. Some sunscreens include an expiration date — a date indicating when they're no longer effective. Discard sunscreen that is past its expiration date. If you buy sunscreen that doesn't have an expiration date, write the date of purchase on the bottle. Throw out the bottle when three years have passed since the purchase date.</p>



<p>In addition to sunscreen, avoid sun exposure in the middle of the day when the UV rays are strongest, wear sunglasses that block both types of UV radiation — UVA and UVB rays — and wear a broad-brimmed hat and other protective clothing.</p>



<p>Exercising and enjoying time outdoors are important for good health. Staying protected from the sun will allow you and your family to do so safely.</p>

<p>Ultraviolet rays from the sun can cause skin damage in as little as 15 minutes. Prolonged exposure and damage can lead to various forms of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/basics/definition/con-20031606" target="_blank">skin cancer</a>, many of which, thankfully, are preventable.</p>



<p>The sun isn't the only skin-damaging predator. Tanning beds and smoking also can have ill effects on the body's outer layer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the common forms of skin cancer?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Skin cancer can take many forms, but the three most common are:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/basics/definition/con-20028996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Basal cell carcinoma</a></strong><br>Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It typically develops on skin that receives a lot of sun, such as the scalp, face, nose, neck and hands. It often appears as a dome-shaped growth with visible blood vessels, a shiny, pinkish patch or a sore that heals and then returns.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/basics/definition/con-20037813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squamous cell carcinoma</a></strong><br>Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer. It also frequently develops on skin exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, lips, back of the hands, arms and legs. Squamous cell carcinoma often appears as a crusted or rough bump; a red, rough flat patch; a dome-shaped bump that grows and bleeds; or a sore that does not heal or heals and returns.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/basics/definition/con-20026009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Melanoma</a></strong><br>Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. It may develop on the skin or in an existing mole. Moles that change in size, color or shape, or develop symptoms, such as pain, itching or bleeding, can be a sign of melanoma. Melanoma can occur anywhere on the skin, including the hands and feet, under the fingernails or toenails, and in the mouth and genital area.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing skin cancer</h2>



<p>The keys to preventing skin cancer are to be sun savvy and know how to keep your skin healthy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Be smart in the sun and protect your skin with these tips:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</strong><br>This is when the sun is most intense and produces the greatest chance of sunburn. If you must be outside during these hours, seek shade using an umbrella, tree or other shelter. Use protective clothing and sunscreen even when in the shade. Learn more with this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/multimedia/skin-cancer-infographic/ifg-20441507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"More Fun, Less Sun" infographic</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Be aware of medications that increase your sensitivity to the sun.</strong><br>Some prescription and over-the-counter medications can make you more sensitive to sunlight. Common drugs include antihistamines such as Benadryl; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including naproxen or ibuprofen; certain antibiotics, including Bactrim or tetracycline; antidepressants; antipsychotics and oral diabetes medications. Check with your pharmacist regarding the side effects of your medication.</li>



<li><strong>Don the right head gear.</strong><br>A wide-brimmed hat can protect your face, ears and neck. If you wear a baseball cap, remember to apply sunscreen to your neck and ears. Also, wear protective clothing that covers exposed areas.</li>



<li><strong>Don't use tanning beds.</strong><br>Tanning beds produce harmful ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, increasing your risk for skin cancer. There also is no proven evidence that using tanning beds to obtain a "base tan" will decrease your risk of sunburn. Beyond that, using tanning beds increases the chance of developing cataracts and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eye-melanoma/basics/definition/con-20027875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ocular melanoma</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Make healthy lifestyle choices.</strong><br>Your behaviors and habits affect the health of your skin. Do not smoke because it damages collagen and elastin in your skin. When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/look-good-and-feel-better-with-skin-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caring for your skin</a>, use mild soaps and daily moisturizers while limiting hot showers which can strip essential oils from your skin. Drink plenty of water to remain hydrated, and get regular sleep to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/what-to-do-about-dry-skin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep your skin looking refreshed</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Perform regular skin checks.</strong><br>Look for any changes to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-abcdes-of-moles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moles</a>, freckles or birthmarks. Additionally, monitor any new skin changes that have occurred. Use a mirror to evaluate hard-to-see areas, and have regular skin evaluations by your healthcare team or dermatologist.</li>



<li><strong>Protect children's skin.</strong><br>Children younger than 6 months should not use sunscreen but should be protected from the sun's rays with protective clothing and shade. Apply sunscreen regularly to children 6 months and older.</li>



<li><strong>Use sunscreen when outdoors.</strong><br>A higher sun protection factor, or SPF, number in sunscreen indicates increased protection. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using at least SPF 30. Use sunscreen even on cloudy or cool days because damage from the sun's rays can still occur. Reapply every two hours. You also should reapply after swimming or when sweating. Check the sunscreen's expiration date. The shelf life typically is three years or less if it has been stored in high temperatures.</li>



<li><strong>Wear sunglasses with UVA and UVB protection.</strong><br>Proper, protective sunglasses help prevent damage to the sensitive skin around your eyes and block ultraviolet light from the sun that may cause&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cataracts/basics/definition/con-20015113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cataracts</a>.</li>

<p>About 1 in 8 men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Many of those patients undergo surgery to get rid of the cancerous tumor.</p>

<p>"Most of the time, prostate cancer is a slower-growing type of tumor," says Dr. Tollefson. "Physically removing it could then cure one from cancer."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Advancements in robotic prostate surgery</h3>



<p>He says surgery is a common option for many men, especially if the cancer is contained in the prostate. Medical innovation has improved cancer removal surgeries. Now, there's an upgrade to the robotic prostatectomy procedure.</p>



<p>"Instead of all of the instruments coming in through separate incisions, they come in through a single incision, and the robot is able to then branch out within the abdomen and remove the prostate," explains Dr. Tollefson.</p>



<p>Patients have a faster recovery and reduced pain with the single-port robotic procedure.</p>



<p>Other prostate cancer treatment options can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Radiation therapy.</li>



<li>Ablative therapies.</li>



<li>Hormone therapy.</li>



<li>Chemotherapy.</li>



<li>Immunotherapy.</li>



<li>Targeted drug therapy.</li>

<p>Ask anyone experiencing cancer fatigue, and they will tell you that it's horrendous. It can feel like your body is working overtime, and you're super exhausted. It's the type of tiredness that won't go away if you rest a bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's different from the normal tiredness we typically have, as it's more intense. It's not easily relieved with rest, and it can greatly impact how you're feeling and doing," says Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="675" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_273084110-1024x675.jpg" alt="word chemotherapy on paper with pills and syringe, cancer" class="wp-image-65937" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_273084110-1024x675.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/05/shutterstock_273084110-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chemotherapy and other treatments can lead to cancer-related fatigue.</figcaption></figure>



<p>He says there are several factors that contribute to cancer-related fatigue, including chemotherapy, radiation, anemia, emotional factors and the cancer itself.</p>



<p>"And then preexisting comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep apnea, can also play a role in cancer-related fatigue as well," explains Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<p>Treatments vary from person to person, but they can consist of physical therapy, energy conservation, psychostimulants and holistic methods.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Staying active helps fight cancer tiredness</h3>



<p>"Yoga, tai chi, Reiki therapy, integrative medicine techniques," says Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<p>It's a good idea to prioritize your schedule and only do the important things. Also, ask for help when needed. Contact your healthcare team if you're suffering from cancer-related fatigue. Mayo Clinic also has a cancer<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cancer-rehabilitation/about/pac-20393327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rehabilitation</a> program to help survivors get back on their feet.</p>

<p>Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer. When treated early, it's also the most curable type of cancer.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/mohs-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mohs surgery</a>&nbsp;is one of the most successful surgical treatments for removing skin cancer.</p>



<p>The abnormal growth of skin cells that leads to skin cancer develops most often on skin exposed to the sun, such as your scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, arms and hands. However, it can also occur on areas of your skin not directly exposed to sunlight, including your palms and beneath your fingernails or toenails.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types of skin cancer</h2>



<p>Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma are three of the most common types of skin cancer. Of those three types, basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are diagnosed most often and are the most curable.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Basal cell carcinoma&nbsp;</strong>— This type of skin cancer often starts as a small, flesh-colored or pearly-looking bump on the skin. It may bleed or have no symptoms. It may look like a pimple that doesn't entirely heal.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/basics/definition/con-20028996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Basal cell carcinoma</a>&nbsp;may extend deep into the tissue under the skin.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma</strong>&nbsp;— This type of skin cancer often starts as a rough or scaly patch or growth on the skin. It can develop rapidly and hurt a bit if touched.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/basics/definition/con-20037813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squamous cell carcinoma</a>&nbsp;usually appears in one place on the skin and rarely spreads to other parts of the body. However, if left untreated, this cancer may grow within the skin and destroy surrounding tissues and structures, such as nerves and muscles. The cancerous cells can then spread to nearby lymph nodes and other areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Melanoma&nbsp;</strong>— While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/basics/definition/con-20026009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melanoma</a>&nbsp;occurs less commonly, it's more serious. It often begins as a dark spot or odd-looking mole. It can grow deep into the tissue under the skin. If left untreated, melanoma can spread to other parts of the body. Early detection and treatment of this cancer are critical.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treating skin cancer with Mohs surgery</h2>



<p>Mohs surgery is intended to remove all the cancerous tissue, called a tumor, and leave as much healthy neighboring skin and tissue as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To diagnose skin cancer, a healthcare professional removes a biopsy, or small tissue sample, to be examined. While you can see the top of the tumor growing on the skin's surface, deeper roots may be out of sight under the skin. The method used during Mohs surgery looks closely at the affected area and surrounding skin to find and remove all of the tumor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Mohs surgeon may recommend this procedure for skin cancer that:</p>



<ul>
<li>Has come back after previous treatment or has a high risk of recurring.</li>



<li>Has developed rapidly and deeply.</li>



<li>Is located around the face, scalp or neck.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect with Mohs surgery</h2>



<p>Mohs surgery is an outpatient surgery, meaning you won't stay in the hospital overnight. The length of the surgery depends on the size and number of tumors to be removed. While surgery can last between one to 10 hours, most surgeries take two to five hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During Mohs surgery, the area of your skin is numbed first. Then, the surgeon removes the tumor and a thin layer of skin around it. After any bleeding is stopped, a temporary bandage is applied. These steps typically take about 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While you wait in the surgical waiting room, the surgeon maps each section of tissue from the tumor that was removed and uses a microscope to examine it for cancer cells. If the surgeon finds cancer cells, the map helps to locate the position in the skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You'll return to the surgical room for the surgeon to remove more tissue from the area where the cancer cells are found. These steps are repeated until the surgeon no longer sees cancer cells under the microscope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the tumor is completely removed, the surgeon determines the best option for closing the wound area, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Side-to-side stitches — Most surgeries are closed this way with a row of sutures if enough loose skin is available next to the wound.</li>



<li>Skin graft — The surgeon may remove a piece of skin from another part of your body to place over the wound.&nbsp;</li>



<li>No stitches — The wound may be left open to heal on its own, depending on the area of the body.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Cartilage harvest — Cartilage is a connective tissue found in the nose and ear. Your surgeon may take cartilage from one of these areas to repair and support the wound.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Skin flap — If your wound is too large to close with side-to-side stitches, a skin flap is used to move nearby skin to cover it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>After surgery, your surgeon may prescribe an antibiotic to lower the risk of infection in the wound. Follow instructions from your care team for managing pain. Depending on the location and size of the wound, each person may have a different level and time frame for pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Healing time also depends on the size of the wound and the way it was closed. The procedure can cause scarring, which will typically soften naturally over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After having skin cancer once, you are at a higher risk of having a recurrence of the same type of cancer or another type of skin cancer. Talk with your healthcare team about how frequently you need full-body skin examinations.</p>

<p><em>By Nicole Brudos Ferrara</em></p>



<p>Though rare, medulloblastoma is the most common cancerous brain tumor in children. These tumors begin in the lower back part of the brain called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ataxia/multimedia/cerebellum-and-brainstem/img-20007645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cerebellum</a>, which is important for balance, coordination and movement. Medulloblastomas are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/embryonal-tumor/cdc-20367985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embryonal tumors</a>&nbsp;that grow from embryonal cells left over from fetal development.</p>



<p>"Of all the tumors we see in pediatrics, 20% are medulloblastoma," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/schwartz-jonathan-d-d-o-m-p-h/bio-20471630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonathan Schwartz, D.O.</a>, a Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center pediatric neuro-oncologist. About&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/medulloblastoma-childhood/statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500 children</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. are diagnosed with medulloblastoma each year. "The peak age is between 5 and 7 years of age, and it's slightly more common in males," he says.</p>



<p>Medulloblastomas are fast-growing, aggressive tumors, but Dr. Schwartz says a better understanding of their biology, new drugs, technology and treatment techniques have improved <a href="https://braintumourresearch.org/en-us/blogs/faq/what-is-the-life-expectancy-of-a-child-with-medulloblastoma#:~:text=Average%205%2Dyear%20survival%20rate,5%20years%20after%20their%20diagnosis." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outcomes for children</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Schwartz explains how medulloblastoma is treated, the latest treatment advances and what families should look for in a care team:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is medulloblastoma treated in children?</h2>



<p>Medulloblastoma treatment depends on tumor type and your child's age. "Treatment usually involves safely removing as much of the tumor as possible, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy," says Dr. Schwartz.</p>



<p>In children younger than 4, Dr. Schwartz says care teams use radiation-sparing techniques, which reduce damage to healthy tissue, and high doses of chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow transplant</a>). In children older than 4, treatment also depends on whether the tumor is average or high risk.</p>



<p>Medulloblastoma is considered average risk if it has not spread to other parts of the body and can be completely or almost completely removed with surgery. If the tumor has spread to other parts of the brain, spinal cord or body and cannot be completely removed with surgery, it is high risk. "If you leave more than 1.5 cubic centimeters of residual disease, we call that high risk. If it's metastatic and has spread anywhere else, it's high risk," says Dr. Schwartz.</p>



<p>Medulloblastoma spreads through the fluid surrounding and protecting the brain and spinal cord. "The spinal cord is like the top of a waterfall," says Dr. Schwartz. "If tumor cells circulate, they could go anywhere around the brain or spine. We always look at the full brain and spine when imaging during treatment and follow-up because the tumor cells can drop and sit at the bottom of the spinal cord. We deliver chemotherapy and radiation to the whole brain and spine to reduce the likelihood of recurrence."</p>



<p>If medulloblastoma recurs, Dr. Schwartz says care teams turn to other aggressive treatments, including chemotherapy and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trials</a>&nbsp;for vaccines,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20404319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy</a>, and other viral therapies. "It's an aggressive disease. That's why we treat it aggressively. If medulloblastoma recurs, we know treatment is generally not curative," he says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the latest advances in medulloblastoma treatment?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Medulloblastomas are now diagnosed using molecular analysis.</h3>



<p>"The world of neuro-oncology has changed dramatically — in a positive way — in 15 years," says Dr. Schwartz. He says one of the biggest medulloblastoma treatment advances is the shift from diagnosing medulloblastoma based on tissue examination under a microscope (histologic diagnosis) to analysis of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/molecular-diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">molecules</a>, such as DNA, RNA and proteins, from a tissue or fluid sample (molecular diagnosis).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>"The world of neuro-oncology has changed dramatically — in a positive way — in 15 years."DR. JONATHAN SCHWARTZ</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Based on molecular diagnostic tests, medulloblastoma tumors are now categorized into four subgroups, and healthcare professionals understand that each requires a different treatment approach. "We now know that you shouldn't treat them all the same. We know that the five-year overall survival for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/rare-brain-spine-tumor/tumors/medulloblastoma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WNT-activated medulloblastoma</a>&nbsp;is 100%. Other subgroups have lower survival or are likely to recur," says Dr. Schwartz.</p>



<p>Understanding these differences between medulloblastoma tumors has helped care teams tailor treatment plans for each child and their tumor type and improve survival and quality of life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Researchers are studying radiation and chemotherapy dose reduction.</h3>



<p>Dr. Schwartz is conducting a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20403517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial</a>&nbsp;to study whether reduced doses of radiation therapy and chemotherapy can effectively treat patients with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma tumors in WNT-driven medulloblastoma, the least aggressive tumor subgroup. "If someone has 100% chance of survival, can we de-escalate the therapy? That's the question we're asking in a clinical trial through the Children's Oncology Group," he says.</p>



<p>"Recent studies have shown radiation and chemotherapy to be effective in treating patients with WNT medulloblastoma, but we're concerned about the late effects of treatment, which can include learning difficulties, reduced amounts of hormones and other problems," says Dr. Schwartz.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer-survivor/art-20045524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Late effects</a>&nbsp;of cancer treatment appear after treatment ends. Children who undergo cancer treatment may be at risk for more late effects than adults because their bones, tissues and organs grow quickly, and cancer treatment can interfere with that growth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Protection against chemotherapy-related hearing loss.</h3>



<p>Cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug effective in treating medulloblastoma, is associated with hearing loss.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2018/cisplatin-hearing-loss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a>&nbsp;has shown this may be due to the drug's accumulation in the inner ear. "Most patients who had cisplatin to treat medulloblastoma wear hearing aids," says Dr. Schwartz.</p>



<p>Care teams now have a tool to protect children with medulloblastoma from chemotherapy-related hearing loss. In 2022, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-approves-sodium-thiosulfate-reduce-risk-ototoxicity-associated-cisplatin-pediatric-patients" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FDA approved</a>&nbsp;the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/sodium-thiosulfate-intravenous-route/side-effects/drg-20066076?p=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sodium thiosulfate</a>&nbsp;to reduce the risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cisplatin-intravenous-route/description/drg-20062953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cisplatin</a>-associated hearing loss in children one month and older who have solid tumors that have not spread. Sodium thiosulfate is given to patients as an IV infusion following cisplatin infusion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What should families look for in a medulloblastoma care team?</h2>



<p>Dr. Schwartz says families should seek care from healthcare professionals who can offer a comprehensive team approach and the latest technology. He says a team of brain tumor specialists who have cared for a high volume of children with medulloblastoma can offer the best possible diagnosis, care and outcomes.</p>



<p>"We have a team approach at Mayo Clinic. We start with oncology, neurology, neurosurgery, social work and radiology. Because we have a high volume of tumor patients, we're experts at seeing the right, the wrong, the middle, and the weird complications and tumors with atypical neuropathology. We have excellent neuropathologists. Their work is critical to getting the right diagnosis so we know how to treat the tumor appropriately. You need a skilled neurosurgeon who knows how to operate on these tumors and give kids the best chance at survival."</p>

</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proton beam therapy</a>, which delivers precise radiotherapy with lower doses of radiation to healthy tissue, is also important for children whose organs are still developing, says Dr. Schwartz. "With proton radiation, we can outline exactly where to treat. And that energy goes to that area and drops off — virtually none goes beyond the tumor. With&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162#:~:text=Radiation%20therapy%2C%20also%20called%20radiotherapy,therapy%20exist%2C%20including%20proton%20radiation." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traditional X-ray radiation</a>&nbsp;in young children, there's radiation scatter, so you're radiating the heart, lungs, liver, diaphragm, kidneys, abdominal organs and other critical brain areas," he says.</p>



<p>If your child has been diagnosed with medulloblastoma, Dr. Schwartz wants you to know there is hope and help available. "There's always hope until there isn't. The question is: How do we give this family the best possible journey? How do we best take care of these patients?"</p>

<p>The journey of a cancer survivor often extends far beyond the triumphant ringing of a brass bell, signaling the end of treatment. Sonya Goins received treatment at Mayo Clinic for HER-2-positive breast cancer in 2020. Since sharing her <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/dancing-through-complex-care-during-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story of survival</a> with the Mayo Clinic News Network, a lot has changed in Sonya's life. She became a Mayo Clinic employee, working in the Communications Department. She also continues to confront post-cancer health challenges, including being diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphedema/symptoms-causes/syc-20374682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymphedema</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"I thought once I rang that bell, it was over. But it wasn't over," says Sonya.</p>



<p>A few months after completing targeted radiation treatment for breast cancer, Sonya noticed swelling in her lower arm.</p>



<p>"I wasn't sure what it was. And they told me, 'Hey, you need to come into the emergency room. It might be an infection.' And (I) went to the emergency room, and they're like, 'No, it's lymphedema,'" says Sonya.</p>

<p>Lymphedema is a chronic and debilitating disease in which tissue swelling is caused by an accumulation of fluid that's usually drained through the lymphatic system.</p>



<p>About 40% of people who undergo breast cancer surgery where their lymph nodes are removed will develop lymphedema.</p>



<p>"It was painful. It was hard to sleep because it just felt like my arm was thumping all the time. I noticed, particularly at the end of the day, like, I typed a lot for my job. And I noticed my arm at the end of the day would swell up," says Sonya.</p>

<p>"To be honest with you, it was a little disheartening because I thought, 'Hey, this is over because, you know, you got the cancer. The cancer is gone, but now you have to live with the aftereffects.'"</p>



<p>But she didn't have to live with it. Sonya did some research and reached out to her Mayo Clinic care team. She found out about a surgery to help patients with lymphedema.</p>

<p>"When I met Sonya, she already had stage 2 disease," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/fahradyan-vahe-m-d/bio-20521873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Vahe Fahradyan</a>, a Mayo Clinic plastic surgeon who specializes in breast reconstruction and lymphatic reconstruction. "In her particular case, because she had some remaining functional lymphatic vessels, we decided that we're going be able to do lymphovenous bypass surgery."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using special dye to identify the lymphatic pathways, surgeons use small incisions to reroute the lymphatic system by connecting tiny lymphatic vessels to tiny veins, creating a detour around the damaged part of the lymphatic system. This new connection restores the body's ability to drain lymphatic fluids.</p>



<p>While lymphedema is considered an incurable disease, getting outcomes like Sonya's, where patients can easily manage the symptoms and improve their quality of life, is the ultimate goal.</p>



<p>"My symptoms are so minimal, says Sonya. "I've gotten back to working out, and I'm able to swing kettlebells, which I couldn't do before. And my arm does not swell up at the end of the day. So that's amazing to be able to sleep and sleep better, and there's no more pain."</p>



<p>Dr. Fahradyan says one major key to achieving that is early diagnosis.</p>



<p>"The message is that if you notice that you have arm swelling or breast swelling or the lower extremities, it is not normal. You don't have to live like this," he says.</p>
