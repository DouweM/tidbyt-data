<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioblastoma/cdc-20350148?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glioblastoma</a> is a fast-growing and aggressive brain tumor that begins as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord. As it grows, it can invade and destroy healthy tissue. There is no cure, but treatments may slow the cancer's growth and reduce symptoms.</p>



<p>Glioblastoma is a diverse cancer, which means that biopsies from different regions of each patient's tumor can represent widely different tumor biology. Treatments that work for one region of the tumor may not work for others.</p>



<p>MRI provides a way to look at the whole tumor but is poor at differentiating regions of unfavorable tumor progression from regions of favorable tumor response which is often mixed with immune response and inflammation. For this reason, it can be difficult for physicians to use imaging to determine if a treatment works for all or part of the patient’s tumor.</p>



<p>This new NCI grant supports a team of researchers to develop the Mathematical Oncology Systems Analysis Imaging Center (MOSAIC). MOSAIC will combine biopsies collected at different regions of each patient’s tumor with features on patient MRIs. MOSAIC researchers rely on these patterns to build mathematical and machine learning models allowing MRI to predict tumor biology in regions that were not biopsied. In this way, MOSAIC researchers can effectively create so-called "virtual biopsies" of patient’s tumors without surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mathematical oncology is the use of mathematics, modeling and simulation in cancer biology and oncology.&nbsp;This fusion of the quantitative sciences with the study of cancer includes the development of predictive mathematical models that help bridge gaps in knowledge in the understanding of cancer or data-driven machine-learning approaches that detect patterns in cancer data that had not been identified previously.</p>



<p>"This grant is important as it will help us use MRI as a lens to more directly predict changes in the biology of each patient’s tumor during treatment when we normally have very limited access to tissue samples," says the study's co-principal investigator, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/swanson-kristin-r-ph-d/bio-20396996?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristin Swanson, Ph.D.</a>, a mathematical oncologist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.  </p>



<p>MOSAIC's image-based mathematical models will use MRI to track aspects of tumor heterogeneity previously unattainable during the course of patient care. This is particularly important as the brain is a protected organ which limits tissue sampling during rare surgical interventions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This grant will allow us to better understand which of our patients are responding to treatment and to ultimately drive new clinical trials that improve patient outcomes," adds Dr. Swanson.</p>



<p>The center will be based at Mayo Clinic in Arizona with co-principal investigator <a href="https://www.pathology.columbia.edu/profile/peter-d-canoll-md#research?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Canoll, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Columbia University, and involves collaboration among multiple institutions, including Arizona State University, Columbia University, City of Hope, Inova, Mayo Clinic Rochester, MD Anderson and Washington University.</p>



<p>The grant is supported by NCI of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under project number <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/erErGjWh7k-kKXXTUi4tag/project-details/10729420details?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1U54CA274504-01A1</a>.

<p>Screening for<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> lung cancer</a> can save lives, and there's an urgent need for more screening of people of color. That's one of the takeaways from the newly released <a href="https://www.lung.org/research/state-of-lung-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"State of Lung Cancer"</a> report from the American Lung Association.</p>



<p>"Lung cancer is the largest (cancer) killer of adult men and women worldwide. Many of the reasons for that is it's so late in its stage, often, when it's diagnosed," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/reisenauer-janani-s-m-d/bio-20433096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Janani Reisenauer</a>, a thoracic surgeon and interventional pulmonologist at Mayo Clinic. "Historical data show that 70% of lung cancers that were being diagnosed were at stage 3, which makes it much more challenging to treat and cure someone of lung cancer."</p>



<p>"Through lung cancer screening, we've been able to identify patients much earlier in their stage, which gives them more treatment options and much more hopeful chances of cure. For that reason, screening is important," she says.</p>

<p>The latest update from the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/lung-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/detection.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a> recommends that people with a substantial smoking history undergo an annual low-dose CT scan for lung cancer screening. Dr. Reisenauer says the new guidelines allow a broader population to be eligible for screening.</p>



<p>"Any patient with a significant smoking history and over age 55 (are the new guidelines). It used to be just 20 years of smoking, and now we've redefined it to say the number of cigarettes per day times the number of years smoking," she says.</p>

<p>"Even if you were smoking for only 10 years and not 20 years, but you were smoking twice as much, you might also be a candidate under the new screening guidelines for a CT," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Reisenauer recommends that eligible patients talk with their primary care team to let them know you are interested in screening.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/09/16-x-9-lung-CT.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of a CT lung cancer screening" class="wp-image-216708" style="width:800px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/09/16-x-9-lung-CT.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/09/16-x-9-lung-CT-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<p><strong>How lung cancer screening works</strong></p>



<p>Screening includes a low-dose CT scan to detect suspicious lung nodules and signs of lung cancer. Detecting lung cancer in its early stages significantly increases the likelihood of successful treatment and cure.</p>



<p>If lung cancer is confirmed, Dr. Reisenauer says a patient will work with a multidisciplinary team to decide the best treatment option.</p>



<p>She says Mayo Clinic continues to pioneer lung cancer treatment through research and innovation, working for better patient outcomes.</p>



<p>"We generate patient-specific individualized custom treatments for those patients, whether it's given IV or a surgery, or something completely novel like through the robotic bronchoscope. Our understanding of how a patient gets lung cancer and how we can treat it to where it's not the No. 1 cancer killer worldwide — I think we'll make much movement there in the next 10 to 20 years," she says.</p>



<p>"And I think screening is a part of that so we can capture these patients early, understand what we're dealing with. But as we're capturing these patients, we are trying to understand how these tumors behave on a cellular, molecular and genetic level. This is very new, and it's an area of interesting science," Dr. Reisenauer says.</p>

<p>Stomach cancer is relatively rare in the U.S. It's often diagnosed at later stages in the disease, when symptoms like nausea, heartburn and feeling bloated are more pronounced.</p>



<p>"In general, when we talk about gastric cancer, we usually talk about a cancer that's arising from the lining of the stomach," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sonbol-mohamad-bassam-b-m-d/bio-20466252?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mohamad Sonbol</a>, a Mayo Clinic oncologist.</p>



<p>Early signs of stomach cancer vary, and can include abdominal pain, blood in the stool or just feeling tired.</p>



<p>"If you have a cancer in the stomach, it might ooze blood very slowly, and that can cause anemia, or low hemoglobin, and that can lead to fatigue," says Dr. Sonbol.</p>



<p>If you're a man, you're at higher risk for stomach cancer than a woman. Other risk factors include obesity, smoking and drinking alcohol.</p>



<p>"And then there are other risk factors, such as there are some hereditary syndromes or things that we inherit from our parents that put us at higher risk of developing gastric cancer, stomach cancer," says Dr. Sonbol.</p>



<p>Treatment options depend on the cancer's location in the stomach, its size and stage, but can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>"I tell patients who have recently been diagnosed with gastric cancer that there is definitely a hope because we've gotten significantly better in the last decade, and more specifically really, in the last year or two, where we have now many more treatment options than we had before," says Dr. Sonbol.</p>

<p>High-grade gliomas are cancerous tumors that spread quickly in the brain or spinal cord. In a new study led by Mayo Clinic, researchers found invasive brain tumor margins of high-grade <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioma</a> (HGG) contain biologically distinct genetic and molecular alterations that point to aggressive behavior and disease recurrence. The findings suggest insights into potential treatments that could modify the course of the disease.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41559-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;published in Nature Communications, profiled 313 tumor biopsies from 68 HGG patients using genomics (study of genes), transcriptomics (study of gene expression at the mRNA level) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>



<p>Glioma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord. The invasive margins of HGG have long remained a mystery due to the difficulties in surgical biopsy of these regions. The aggressive nature of most gliomas, and the visual and textural similarities between the affected regions and normal tissue, create a challenge for neurosurgeons during removal of the tumor. Some glioma cells may get left behind.</p>



<p>The cells in a glioma look like healthy brain cells called glial cells. As a glioma grows, it forms a mass of cells called a tumor. The tumor can grow to press on brain or spinal cord tissue, causing a range of symptoms. There are many types of glioma. Some grow slowly and aren't considered to be cancers. Others are considered cancerous. Malignant gliomas grow quickly and can invade healthy brain tissue.</p>

<p>Millions of patients, families and visitors journey to Mayo Clinic for hope and healing — each with their own unique life story. Kurt, an 80-year-old Mayo Clinic volunteer, has a life story you need to hear.</p>



<p>"I was born in Stimmersdorf, which was within the Nazi-occupied territory of the Czech Republic," Kurt says.</p>



<p>In 1943, when Kurt was still an infant, his father was forced by the Nazis to fight for the German army on the Eastern Front, as Kurt and his mother were sent to the concentration camps.</p>



<p>"The one soldier said, 'Leutnant, ich habe zwei Juden hier.&nbsp;(Lieutenant, I've got two Jews here.)' And we were sent to Auschwitz," Kurt says.</p>



<p>A year later, sent to Dachau. As the Allies approached in spring of '45, Kurt and his mother were quickly being transported by the Nazis to another camp when the train derailed. They survived the crash and escaped.</p>



<p>"We kept going and kept going until we couldn't hear any more dogs barking, screaming, shooting," he says.</p>



<p>They spent 16 weeks on the run avoiding capture until the war ended. "We had to live off the land, so to speak," Kurt says.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Kurt's father was a prisoner of the Soviets. "Trains would come from Russia and bring home POWs," he says.</p>



<p>And during Hanukkah 1949 at the train station, "... it was the worst, coldest winter ever recorded. We heard a faint voice, 'Ester, bist du das? (Ester is that you?)' We turned around, it was my father," Kurt says.</p>



<p>In 1956, the family immigrated to the U.S. "And we saw the Statue of Liberty," he says. </p>



<p>They settled in Albany, New York. And as a young man at 18, Kurt became an American. "Tears came down my cheek, and I was so happy," he says.</p>



<p>And he joined the Army.</p>



<p>"I wanted to give back, and I served. It was the only way I could thank this great country called the United States of America and the American people for having allowed me to come here," Kurt says.</p>



<p>He served a 30-year military career in the Army Special Forces as a Green Beret. "Freedom is such a powerful word," Kurt says. </p>



<p>He is reminded every day what freedom truly means. "Freedom gives you hope," he says.</p>



<p>A cancer diagnosis brought him to Mayo Clinic, where he's been treated for the past 23 years by a leading expert in advanced <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kwon-eugene-d-m-d/bio-20054440?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Eugene Kwon</a>.</p>



<p>"They gave me my life back. He spent as much time with me as possible, and I know with him, I was always in the best of hands," Kurt says.</p>



<p>It inspired Kurt to move to Rochester, Minnesota, and volunteer at Mayo Clinic. </p>



<p>"Monday through Friday, usually from 6:45 a.m. to 11 o'clock," he says. "This was the perfect opportunity. I knew there were patients coming through here, military people coming through here that I can relate to — not only talk to these people, but uplift their spirits, and instill in them that there is hope, that they're in the right place."</p>



<p>"Positive attitude, sunshine in the heart, and I use the gray matter God put between my ears to spread the joy, the happiness and goodwill, so to speak. This is why I'm supposed to be here," Kurt says. "America gave me freedom, hope. Mayo Clinic did the same thing."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — New research from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> finds that patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphedema/symptoms-causes/syc-20374682?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymphedema</a> —swelling of the limbs caused by the accumulation of protein-rich fluids of the immune system — had twice the risk of developing skin cancer than patients without lymphedema.</p>



<p>Patients with lymphedema had a significantly higher frequency of developing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basal cell carcinomas</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352480?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">squamous cell carcinomas</a> on the lower extremities, according to the retrospective study published in <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00117-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>. The study contributes to growing information linking lymphedema to localized changes in immunity and a predisposition for cancer.</p>



<p>The study reviewed data from 4,437 patients who were diagnosed with lower extremity lymphedema at Mayo Clinic in Rochester from 2000 to 2020. Compared with a matched control group, the group with lymphedema had an increased risk of skin cancer, and for patients who had lymphedema in one leg, that extremity was nearly three times as likely to have skin cancer compared with the other leg.</p>



<p>Lymphedema can be caused by surgery or cancer treatments that remove or damage the lymph nodes, which carry fluids of the immune system. Less commonly, lymphedema can be caused by inherited conditions.</p>

<p>"Patients with lymphedema are not screened routinely by dermatologists, and inadequate screening may lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/alavi-afsaneh-m-d/bio-20492616?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Afsaneh Alavi, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic dermatologist and the study's senior author. "Our findings suggest the need for a relatively high degree of suspicion of skin cancer at sites with lymphedema. There is a need for raising awareness in clinicians seeing patients with lymphedema, and these patients may need regular skin cancer screenings, since early detection of skin cancer is critical."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —<strong> </strong>An international research team led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/starlinger-patrick-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-20533712">Dr. Patrick Starlinger</a>, a hepatobiliary and pancreas surgeon from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/starlinger-patrick-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-20533712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, developed a risk prediction model that can be calculated with a smartphone app. It provides an individualized risk assessment for patients before liver resection to evaluate the safety of liver surgery. Compared to standard preoperative tests, the research suggests the model offers a predictive model for postoperative liver failure.</p>



<p>The model's effectiveness is documented in a paper that involved more than 14,000 patients from 10 different institutions and the <a href="https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/data-and-registries/acs-nsqip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Surgery Quality Improvement Program</a> (NSQIP), an algorithm-based database from the U.S. The study is published in the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/abstract/9900/an_apri_albi_based_multivariable_model_as.676.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annals of Surgery</a>.</p>



<p>Surgical removal of parts of the liver remains the only curative approach for patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver-specific cancer</a>. Normally, the liver can tolerate the surgical removal, also known as resection, of up to 75% of its volume and maintain its functions after surgery. However, depending on the underlying chronic liver disease, the type of cancer or the extent of resection, patients may be at higher risk of inadequate postoperative liver regeneration or even postoperative liver failure, the main cause of mortality after liver surgery.</p>



<p>The team of researchers developed a multivariable risk prediction model using basic patient characteristics such as age, sex, tumor type and planned type of liver resection, as well as the APRI+ALBI score. The APRI+ALBI score is an established liver function test, calculated using only routine laboratory parameters (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), platelets, albumin, bilirubin). It has already been shown to be closely related to preoperative liver function and chemotherapy-induced liver injury, and it has significant predictive potential for the development of postoperative liver failure. The APRI+ALBI score provides a comprehensive assessment of liver function, especially compared to classic liver function tests, which usually only assess the excretory capacity of the liver.</p>



<p>"We have taken an important step in translating this into clinical practice by developing a freely available smartphone application that allows us to calculate our score and thus individualize the risk assessment of patients before liver resection," says Dr. Starlinger, senior author of the study. "This sets a new standard in preoperative risk assessment and will significantly increase the safety of liver surgery for patients worldwide."</p>



<p>Details about the app and a full list of centers involved in the research are available in the <a href="https://www.meduniwien.ac.at/web/en/about-us/news/2023/news-in-november-2023/smart-phone-application-to-increase-safety-in-liver-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news release</a> by the Medical University of Vienna. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sisters often share certain genetic traits, such as hair color and facial features. But for three sisters from Minnesota, they discovered a much deeper connection — a shared genetic mutation known to dramatically increase their risk for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Their BRCA1 variants came to light through a <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a> DNA sequencing study. The study highlights the importance of genetic screening and the potential for hereditary health concerns. The diagnoses have prompted each of the sisters to take preventative actions for themselves, and their families. </p>



<p>"Having this knowledge is lifesaving and life changing," says Chris Swatfager, the middle sister from Minnesota who was the first to undergo the DNA testing and receive the difficult diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>BRCA1 is an inherited condition that significantly increases the likelihood of developing breast and ovarian cancer during a person's lifetime. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet#:~:text=Breast%20cancer%3A%20About%2013%25%20of,age%20(2%E2%80%934)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>, the breast cancer risk is 55%-72%, compared to approximately 13% for the general population. The risk for ovarian cancer ranges from 30%-60%, compared to approximately 1% for the general population. A parent with a BRCA1 mutation has a 50% chance of passing it down to their child. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Genetic screening reveals hidden health risks</h3>



<p>Given Chris's medical history of breast lumps, and her sister Carrie's breast cancer battle 16 years earlier, she says a clear picture suddenly came into focus. However, her original motivation to participate in the DNA sequencing study was driven by the heartbreaking death of her youngest sister, Amy, who had a heart attack in 2020. It marked the second heart attack-related death in the family. Chris believed there must be a hereditary link to heart disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris had learned that the Mayo Clinic study was screening for three actionable hereditary conditions, including a high cholesterol disorder called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/familial-hypercholesterolemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">familial hypercholesterolemia</a>, which raises the risk for a heart attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other conditions in the study were related to BRCA1, as well as BRCA2, which is associated with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Additionally,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank">Lynch Syndrome</a>&nbsp;was being assessed, which raises the risk of colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>Though none of these other conditions had crossed her mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To her surprise, Chris's results ruled out a genetic susceptibility to familial hypercholesterolemia, revealing instead a BRCA1 mutation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After undergoing comprehensive genetic counseling and receiving guidance from her physician, Chris opted for a double mastectomy and hysterectomy to mitigate her cancer risks. She also shared her diagnosis with her sisters, who, in turn, pursued genetic testing and received their own BRCA1 diagnoses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Carrie Patnode, who had already battled breast cancer at the age of 48, the diagnosis has brought assurance that she can stay ahead of any new cancer developments with increased screenings and scans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I think I may have done things differently if the BRCA test would have been provided when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer," Carrie says. "Now, after everything I've been through, I figure I'm going in every six months and getting mammograms every year and doing MRIs every year, and I'm confident they're going to find anything that reappears."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cindy Larson, the oldest among the sisters and a retired letter carrier, developed bladder cancer shortly after receiving her genetic test results. She has chosen to hold off on any preventative procedures related to her BRCA1 variant, guided by the advice of her Mayo Clinic physician,<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pruthi-sandhya-m-d/bio-00083681">&nbsp;Sandhya Pruthi, M.D.</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A new frontier in predicting disease risk</h3>



<p>Dr. Pruthi specializes in breast cancer prevention, and she’s working to pinpoint Cindy's genetic risk estimation related to her breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Pruthi says new and sophisticated genome sequencing technologies are opening the door to less invasive alternatives with the advancement of polygenic risk scores. The complex scores, compiled from a combination of data from thousands of a person's DNA variants, have the potential to offer precise insights into how patients should respond to a genetic mutation diagnosis associated with a cancer syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Polygenic risk scores allow us to potentially determine a patient's 5-year, 10-year and lifetime cancer risk," Dr. Pruthi says. "It may help us determine if and when a patient should undergo preventative procedures now or opt for surveillance over the next decade." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, Dr. Pruthi says the power of genetic testing lies in its ability to help identify patients at high risk for cancer, enabling earlier screening and mitigating the risk of metastatic cancer and premature deaths — something she sees all too often.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quest to bring genetic screening into everyday healthcare</h3>



<p>Mayo Clinic is advancing the idea of bringing genetic screening to routine patient care.</p>



<p>“We’re also studying the health utilization needs of those patients affected. This knowledge will transform the delivery of care in the coming decade,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights">Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.D.</a>, the Carlson and Nelson Endowed Executive Director for Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine.</p>



<p>Dr. Lazaridis says the immense impact of population-scale genetic screening reaches far beyond the benefits to individual people. It is also about the biological family members of those affected.</p>



<p>“It provides a collective wisdom that can shape public health strategies, increase disease prevention, and advance individualized medicine. It empowers people to be proactive about their own healthcare and prevention.” Dr. Lazaridis says.</p>



<p>For Chris, Carrie and Cindy, equally important to their own diagnoses is sharing the hereditary condition with their children and other blood relatives so they too can receive early disease detection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This affects generations of families and I hope genetic testing will soon become available for everyone," Chris says.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I'm a 28-year-old woman recently diagnosed with breast cancer. My care team recommends starting treatment as soon as possible. While I'm ready to do the necessary treatments, I'm worried about the affect it may have on my ability to have children in the future. Are there options that can help preserve my fertility during cancer treatment?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> When a person is <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/11-tips-for-coping-with-a-cancer-diagnosis">diagnosed with cancer</a>, the focus is often on immediate treatment and recovery. However, it's important to consider the long-term effects of cancer and its therapies on fertility. These treatments can significantly affect a person's reproductive organs, potentially altering their ability to have children in the future.</p>



<p>Cancer and its treatments can cause <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/benign-breast-disease">changes in your body</a>. For some people, cancer damages a part of the reproductive process and affects fertility. For others, the necessary cancer treatments interfere with fertility. The likelihood that cancer treatment will harm your fertility depends on the type and stage of cancer, the cancer treatment method and your age at the time of treatment.</p>



<p>Cancers that have a greater risk of affecting fertility – including through treatment – are breast cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer and blood cancers like lymphomas.</p>



<p>Certain cancer treatments can harm your fertility. The effects might be temporary or permanent.</p>



<p>Cancer treatment and its effects might include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong><br>This common <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/scalp-cooling-therapy-prevents-hair-loss-during-chemotherapy">cancer treatment targets</a> and destroys active cells in the body. The ovaries and testicles, which are vital reproductive organs, contain a high number of active cells and are susceptible to damage from chemotherapy. This damage can affect the ability of the ovaries or testicles to produce viable eggs or sperm after cancer treatment, thus affecting fertility. Future fertility depends on various factors, such as the type, duration and dose of chemotherapy, and the patient's age.</li>



<li><strong>Radiation</strong><br>This therapy also can affect fertility, primarily when administered in the pelvic area at high doses. In some cases, patients may opt to have surgery to reposition the ovaries from the radiation field, reducing the risk of damage.</li>



<li><strong>Surgery</strong><br>Fertility also can be harmed by the surgical removal of the testicles, uterus or ovaries.</li>



<li><strong>Other cancer medications</strong><br>Hormone therapies used to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/medications-to-lower-breast-cancer-risk">treat certain cancers</a>, including breast cancer, can affect fertility. But the effects often are reversible. Once treatment stops, fertility may be restored.</li>
</ul>



<p>Various fertility preservation options may be available for cancer patients before they undergo cancer treatment.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Freezing</strong><br>For women, egg freezing or embryo freezing are standard practices, with minor differences depending on whether the patient has a partner or intends to use donor sperm. These methods involve hormonal stimulation with injections over a few weeks and retrieval of eggs from the ovaries. The eggs can be immediately cryopreserved or mixed with sperm for fertilization for the cryopreservation of embryos.</li>



<li><strong>Cryopreservation</strong><br>Another option is ovarian tissue cryopreservation, which involves removing and freezing part or all of an ovary. The ovarian tissue is divided into small strips and cryopreserved for future use. This method is particularly suitable for young girls who haven't reached puberty or women who need to start cancer treatment immediately. Men may consider sperm cryopreservation, which involves freezing and storing sperm for use at a later date. Testicular tissue cryopreservation also could be a consideration for boys before puberty.</li>



<li><strong>Suppression</strong><br>Ovarian suppression may be considered, but it is not a proven method of fertility preservation. Ovarian suppression involves medications temporarily suppressing ovarian activity, potentially protecting the ovaries from chemotherapy's effects.</li>
</ul>



<p>During cancer treatment, radiation shields can protect fertility in men and women. This procedure places small lead shields over the ovaries or testicles to reduce the radiation exposure they receive. Proton radiotherapy also can preserve fertility by delivering targeted therapy and minimizing exposure to adjoining organs and tissues.</p>



<p>The diagnosis of cancer and the treatment process can be overwhelming. However, you have options if you're concerned about how cancer treatment might affect your fertility. Don't wait. Talk with your care team about fertility preservation methods before you begin cancer treatment to help you make an informed choice. — <strong><em>By </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/alicia-ogle-np"><strong><em>Alicia Ogle</em></strong></a><strong>,<em> </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/obstetrics-and-gynecology"><strong><em>OB-GYN</em></strong></a><strong> <em>nurse practitioner, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire"><strong><em>Eau Claire, Wisconsin</em></strong></a><strong><em>, and </em></strong><a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/reproductive-endocrinology-and-infertility-fellowship-minnesota/department-and-faculty/"><strong><em>Jessica Bleess</em></strong></a><strong>,<em> </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/reproductive-endocrinology-and-infertility-in-minnesota/overview/ovc-20424328?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><strong><em>Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility</em></strong></a><strong><em> physician assistant, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My sister was just diagnosed with breast cancer and will have a double mastectomy. What types of reconstruction could she have, and when can the reconstruction be done? Are there any new reconstruction options that she should be aware of? I've heard about 3D tattooing. Is that an option?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Breast reconstruction is a procedure that restores the shape of your breast after <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">mastectomy</a>, which is an operation that removes your breast to treat or prevent breast cancer.</p>



<p>Breast reconstruction can be performed with either an implant — silicone devices filled with silicone gel or saline — or a patient's own tissue. Most people who undergo mastectomy tend to choose <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-reconstruction-implants/about/pac-20384934?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">implant-based breast reconstruction</a>, with a smaller portion opting for flap, or autologous, reconstruction. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-reconstruction-flap/about/pac-20384937?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Breast reconstruction with flap surgery</a> involves taking a section of tissue — skin, fat and occasionally muscle — from one area of your body, most often your abdomen, and relocating it to create a new breast mound.</p>



<p>Each method has its benefits and drawbacks. For example, implant-based breast reconstruction involves a shorter operation and recovery, whereas flap surgery is a longer, more complex operation with a longer recovery time. Also, implants are temporary and will require removal or replacement on average every 10 years. With flap surgery, typically, no further operations are necessary.</p>



<p>Breast reconstruction starts at the time of mastectomy. A team of breast oncologic and plastic surgeons working together to devise the appropriate plan for your needs is essential.</p>



<p>Depending on the location of the tumor and the patient's breast size, they may be a candidate for a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-cancer-surgery/about/pac-20385255#dialogId52876411?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">nipple-sparing mastectomy</a>, which allows for a more natural reconstruction appearance. A nipple-sparing mastectomy involves the removal of the breast tissue, but spares the skin, nipple and areola, also called the nipple-areolar complex.</p>



<p>If the tumor is abutting the nipple-areolar complex, the patient will need surgical removal of the nipple. Nipple reconstruction can be done with a 3D nipple-areola tattoo with or without the creation of a raised area of skin to reconstruct a raised nipple. 3D nipple tattooing is highly encouraged for all patients who have required surgical excision of the nipple-areolar complex. Data shows patients are more satisfied with reconstruction and can move forward from their cancer journey when reconstruction of the nipple is performed.</p>



<p>In the past, breast reconstruction would not provide the same sensations as before mastectomy. However, breast resensation is the new frontier within breast reconstruction. This is a new technique of breast nerve repair during breast reconstruction that can potentially restore feeling after a mastectomy. This can be done in one of two ways.</p>



<p>First, suppose the patient is a candidate for nipple-sparing mastectomy and is approximately a C cup or less at the time of mastectomy. In that case, we can identify the nerves on the lateral chest and bridge the gap beneath the nipple-areolar complex with a nerve graft. The nerve will then regenerate through the graft, providing sensation to the nipple-areolar complex. While this can take up to two years, it should restore light touch to the breast and nipple-areolar complex, but it will not fully return premastectomy breast sensation.</p>



<p>The second approach is pursued if the patient is undergoing flap surgery. We can identify a nerve on the tissue from the abdomen and connect that via nerve graft to a nerve in the chest. This can be an option for patients who have already had a mastectomy — and possibly implant-based breast reconstruction — and desire more sensation.</p>



<p>Breast reconstruction is an excellent option for many patients. It can give you a breast contour, provide symmetry to your breasts under clothing and help you avoid the need for an external prosthesis inside your bra. Many patients find that their self-esteem and body image improve after reconstruction, and it helps to erase physical reminders of their cancer journey. However, before breast reconstruction surgery, consult a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/plastic-reconstructive-surgery-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20473067?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">plastic surgeon</a> who is board-certified and experienced in breast reconstruction following mastectomy. <em>—</em> <strong><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/harless-christin-a-m-d/bio-20343911?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Dr. Christin Harless</a>, Plastic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>
