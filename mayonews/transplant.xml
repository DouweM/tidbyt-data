<p>Britiny Schultz can't wait for fall. A huge football fan, she's looking forward to cheering on her favorite teams. It's something many fans take for granted — not Britiny. She's able to keep cheering, thanks to her doctors at Mayo Clinic and the incredible gift of life from not just one, but two organ donors.</p>

<p>The South Dakota native says she closely follows two teams: "The Bison for North Dakota and the Dallas Cowboys."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are two teams with storied histories. But there's a third team that tops them both, at least in Britiny's mind. "I have an amazing team here," she says.</p>

<p>"Here" is the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/sections/overview/ovc-20203894?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant center at Mayo Clinic</a>. Britiny was born with a congenital heart defect. As a young girl, she was able to live with the issue, but slowly her symptoms took their toll. In 2016, Britiny underwent a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/lung-transplant/sections/overview/ovc-20212476?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double-lung transplant</a>. Then, in the fall of 2022, she says she started having new troubles.</p>



<p>"Couldn't really do a whole lot. You know, just was tired all the time. Lost my breath doing anything, you know, stuff like that. Just couldn't keep up with everyday life," Britiny says.</p>



<p>A trip back to Mayo in early 2023 uncovered the problem. "She developed a very serious lung infection called scedosporium, which is very, very difficult to treat. And, unfortunately, it led to a decline in her lung function," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/saddoughi-sahar-m-d-ph-d/bio-20533719?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sahar Saddoughi</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="885" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/with-DR2-885x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385559" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/with-DR2-885x1024.jpg 885w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/with-DR2-259x300.jpg 259w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/with-DR2-768x889.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/with-DR2.jpg 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Saddoughi and Britiny</figcaption></figure>



<p>The good news is that Britiny's new heart remained strong. The bad news is that once the fungal infection is in the lungs, it's very hard to get rid of. Dr. Saddoughi says she knew they needed to approach Britiny's case differently. "Can we just retransplant her lungs, keep her heart there and then treat her with very potent antifungals to try to get rid of that infection?" Dr. Saddoughi asked her team.</p>



<p>But would it work? As they investigated, Dr. Saddoughi and her team found one other case reported in medical literature, but even that wasn't exactly the same. She says another question mark was connecting the new lungs to the trachea.</p>



<p>"When she had that initial transplant, her connection to the donor lung was at the level of the trachea. But for just a lung transplant, now you're doing the connection lower. And that was one of the surgical challenges or concerns that we had," says Dr. Saddoughi.</p>



<p>But the decision was made to go ahead. Britiny says she had mixed feelings.</p>



<p>"I was scared. Because the first time, I didn't know what to expect. And then this time was, I knew. But yeah, it was just scary — but exciting too," says Britiny.</p>



<p>In March of 2023, Britiny underwent her second double-lung transplant. At a recent follow-up appointment, Dr. Saddoughi shared that the lungs were working fine, and the infection was gone. She credits the way that different teams worked so well together.</p>



<p>"What's great about Mayo is that we have so much expertise in all the different areas, which is how we can do cases like this — so our lung transplant pulmonology team, our infectious diseases team, all the people that are working in the hospitals to really help us through the surgery and her postoperative and preoperative care. It's really critical for the success of our patients," says Dr. Saddoughi.</p>

<p>While the start of football season is still a few months away, Britiny says she has been tracking her teams. "I know what's going on all the time — let's just put it that way — even on offseason," she says.</p>



<p>She adds that she is looking forward to cheering her teams on, including her team at Mayo.</p>



<p>"I can't thank everyone enough — I mean nurses, doctors, everything," Britiny says.</p>

<p>Over 100,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891">organ transplant</a>. Unfortunately, many may never get the call saying that a suitable donor organ — and a second chance at life — has been found. It's estimated that more than 15 people die every day in the U.S. because of the lack of donor organs.</p>



<p>It can be hard to think about what's going to happen to your body after you die, let alone donating your organs and tissue. But being an organ donor is a generous, worthwhile decision that can be lifesaving.</p>



<p>If you've never considered organ donation or delayed becoming a donor because of something you've heard, here are answers to some common organ donation myths and concerns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: If I agree to donate my organs, the hospital staff won't work as hard to save my life.</h2>



<p>Fact: When you go to the hospital for treatment, healthcare professionals focus on saving your life — not somebody else's. You'll receive care from healthcare professionals whose expertise most closely matches your condition and who can give you the best care possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Maybe I won't really be dead when they sign my death certificate.</h2>



<p>Fact: Although it's a popular topic in the tabloids, in reality, people don't start to wiggle their toes after they're declared dead. People who have agreed to organ donation are given more tests to determine that they're truly dead than those who haven't agreed to organ donation. These extra tests are done at no charge to their families.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Organ donation is against my religion.</h2>



<p>Fact: Organ donation is consistent with the beliefs of most major religions. These religions include Roman Catholicism, Islam, most branches of Judaism and most Protestant faiths. If you're unsure of or uncomfortable with your faiths position on organ donation, ask your clergy member.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: I'm under 18. I'm too young to make this decision.</h2>



<p>Fact: Many states allow people younger than 18 to register as organ donors, but the final decision will remain the responsibility of your parents or legal guardian. Discuss your wish to become an organ donor with your family, and ask for their consent. Keep in mind that children need organ transplants, and they usually need organs smaller than those an adult can provide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: An open-casket funeral isn't an option for people who have donated organs or tissues.</h2>



<p>Fact: Organ and tissue donation doesn't interfere with having an open-casket funeral. The donor's body is clothed for burial and treated with care and respect, and there are no visible signs of organ or tissue donation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: I'm too old to donate. Nobody would want my organs.</h2>



<p>Fact: There's no defined cutoff age for donating organs. The decision to use your organs is based on strict medical criteria, not age. Don't prematurely disqualify yourself. Let the doctors decide at the time of your death whether your organs and tissues are suitable for transplantation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: I'm not in the best of health. Nobody would want my organs or tissues.</h2>



<p>Fact: Few medical conditions automatically disqualify you from donating organs. Again, the decision to use an organ is based on strict medical criteria. It may turn out that certain organs aren't able to be transplanted, but other organs and tissues may be fine. Don't prematurely disqualify yourself. Only medical professionals at the time of your death can determine whether your organs can be transplanted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: I'd like to donate one of my kidneys now, but I wouldn't be allowed to do that unless one of my family members is in need.</h2>



<p>Fact: While that used to be the case, it isn't any longer. Whether it's a distant family member, friend or stranger you want to help, you can donate a kidney through certain transplant centers as what is known as a living donor.</p>



<p>If you decide to become a living donor, you will undergo extensive questioning to ensure that you know the risks and that your decision to donate isn't based on financial gain. You also will undergo testing to determine if your kidneys are in good shape and whether you can live a healthy life with just one kidney.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Rich and famous people go to the top of the list when they need a donor organ.</h2>



<p>Fact: The rich and famous aren't given priority when it comes to allocating organs. It may seem that way because of the amount of publicity generated when a celebrity receives a transplant, but they are treated no differently than anyone else. In reality, celebrity and financial status are not considered in organ allocation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: My family will be charged if I donate my organs.</h2>



<p>Fact: The organ donor's family is never charged for donation. The family is charged for the costs of all final efforts to save your life, and those are sometimes misinterpreted as costs related to organ donation. Costs for organ recovery go to the transplant recipient.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Becoming an organ donor is easy. You can indicate that you want to be a donor in these ways:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Register with your state's donor registry.</strong><br>Most states have registries. Check the list at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.organdonor.gov/" target="_blank">organdonor.gov</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Designate your choice on your driver's license.</strong><br>Do this when you obtain or renew your license.</li>



<li><strong>Tell your family.</strong><br>Make sure your family knows your wishes regarding donation.</li>
</ul>



<p>The best way to ensure that your wishes are carried out is to register with your state's organ donation registry and include donor designation on your driver's license or state ID. Taking these steps legally authorizes your organ donation upon death.</p>



<p>If you have designated someone to make healthcare decisions for you if you become unable to do so, make sure that person knows that you want to be an organ donor. You also may include your wishes in your living will if you have one, but that paperwork might not be immediately available at the time of your death.</p>



<p>It's also important to tell your family you want to be a donor. Hospitals seek consent from the next of kin before removing organs, although this isn't required if you're registered with your state's donor registry or have donor designation on your driver's license or state ID card.</p>

<p>Every 10 minutes, someone is added to the national kidney transplant waiting list.</p>



<p>"It's more than 80,000 people," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>She says living kidney donor chains are a great way to increase the number of available organs for transplant.</p>

<p>"A living kidney donor chain is when someone altruistically donates a kidney, meaning donates a kidney with not a specific individual in mind, that can start a chain effect of donors," explains Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>A donor chain also can be initiated when a good Samaritan donates on behalf of a friend or family member, but unfortunately, they're not a direct match for the recipient. The incompatible donor then donates their kidney to another person who is a match, while the original recipient gets a kidney from another compatible donor in the chain.</p>



<p>"There's no limit on the chain reaction. There have been chains of two, four, eight, sometimes even more," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>It's a gift that keeps on giving. Living donor chains expand the donor pool, helping more people in need of a kidney transplant.</p>



<p>Potential donors undergo an extensive screening process before donating.

<p>Their pioneering research focuses on using CAR-T cells derived from the patient's own immune system to prevent rejection of donated organs. Sensitized patients are those who have high levels of antibodies that cause their immune systems to react negatively to potential donor organs. These patients often face extended waiting periods for a transplant.</p>

<p>"This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of using an immunotherapy that would remove B cells that cause sensitization in patients waiting for a kidney transplant," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/jarmi-tambi-m-d/bio-20536410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tambi Jarmi, M.D.</a>, first author on the study and a transplant nephrologist at Mayo Clinic in Florida. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"This research is one of the first steps toward applying CAR-T cells in the field of transplantation to try to make more donor organs available for transplant and reduce the wait for patients who need a new kidney."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Research on CAR-T cell therapy and transplantation</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers in the lab of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, developed a new type of CAR-T cell therapy that targets a protein known as B cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), which is present on B cells. B cells play a key role in regulating the immune system and generating antibodies. They investigated whether the BAFF-R CAR-T cells could target and remove B cells that cause sensitization.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Qin-WF826186_0009-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385174" style="width:260px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Qin-WF826186_0009-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Qin-WF826186_0009-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Qin-WF826186_0009.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>For this study, researchers generated BAFF-R CAR-T cells from 10 patients considered sensitized to organ transplantation. Nine of them had undergone kidney transplants and one had received a lung transplant.</p>



<p>"We isolated T cells from a small quantity of the patient's blood. These CAR-T cells were then engineered to identify and neutralize B cells carrying a specific antigen, effectively targeting and eliminating the sensitizing cells," says Dr. Qin, lead author on the study, who is an immunologist and CAR-T cell researcher.</p>



<p>Then, the research team compared the activity of BAFF-R CAR-T cells to T cells after they were treated with B cells from healthy donors. Researchers saw a reduction in B cells from the sensitized patient group that had been treated with patient-derived CAR-T cells when compared to the non-CAR-T control group.</p>



<p>"Our study demonstrated that BAFF-R CAR-T cells derived from sensitized patients exhibited killing effects against B cells, which substantiates the viability of using BAFF-R CAR-T cell therapy as a desensitization strategy in kidney transplant," says Dr. Jarmi.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic now is preparing to biomanufacture the BAFF CAR-T cells at its commercial-grade facilities in Florida for testing in early-stage clinical trials.</p>



<p>The use of BAFF-R CAR-T cell therapy to desensitize kidney transplant patients is considered experimental. It is among the first investigations into the use of this immunotherapy for diseases beyond cancer. This research is a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20404319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Regenerative Immunotherapy and CAR-T Translational Research Program</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Department of Transplant Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hematology-oncology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology</a>.</p>



<p>Additional research is needed to validate the findings of this study. See <a href="https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(24)00159-5/fulltext">the paper</a> for a complete list of authors and their disclosures.</p>

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/">Mayo Clinic</a> and <a href="https://terasaki.org/institute/">Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation</a> announced today a research collaboration centered on improving organ transplant outcomes.</p>



<p>Beginning in April, Mayo Clinic biomedical researchers and Terasaki Institute scientists will work together on two core areas: real-time monitoring of donated organ health from procurement to transplant surgery and developing predictive technologies to determine which transplant recipients have a higher likelihood of rejection. That will be done by creating prognostic signatures and assays for antibody-mediated rejection of organ transplant. These initial projects are expected to take 24 to 30 months to complete.</p>



<p>"As the largest organ transplant provider in the United States, Mayo Clinic is deeply invested in finding innovative solutions to improve transplant care for patients. That is why we are so excited about this new collaboration with the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935">Burcin Taner, M.D.,</a> chair of the Transplant Center at Mayo Clinic in Florida and chair of Mayo Clinic Transplant Specialty Council. "Bringing these two institutions together with the same goal of improving transplant outcomes for patients will positively affect many lives."</p>

<p>"We are also very excited about our collaboration with Mayo Clinic," says Ali Khademhosseini, Ph.D., director and CEO of the Terasaki Institute of Biomedical Innovation. "We’re looking forward to conducting impactful research to enhance the quality of life for transplant patients, and we are happy to build upon the work of Dr. Paul I. Terasaki, a pioneer in the field of organ transplantation, who founded the original Terasaki Institute."&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 103,000 people in the U.S. are on the waiting list for an organ transplant. <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics">Every eight minutes</a>, another person is added to the transplant waiting list.</p>



<p>This latest collaboration is part of Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/transforming-transplant-initiative-aspires-to-save-lives-through-bioengineering/">Transforming Transplant initiative</a>, which has the bold goal of providing organ transplants for everyone who needs one. The initiative was created as a collaboration between Mayo Clinic's Transplantation programs and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about">Mayo Clinic's Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>. Its goals include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Restoring donated organs by optimizing them for best outcomes and decreasing discard rates.</li>



<li>Preventing organ failure in patients who have received organ transplants.</li>



<li>Preventing organ failure and the need for a transplant through early diagnosis of organ dysfunction.</li>



<li>Engineering new organs, subsequently eliminating the uncertainty of organ donation and long waits.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a>, with locations in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota, has performed more than 32,000 organ transplants since 1963.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new drug has been shown to increase healing and regeneration of the liver after major surgery, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867424002253?via%3Dihub">study published in the scientific journal Cell</a>. Researchers hope that this could lead to more surgical options for patients diagnosed with advanced liver tumors and liver failure.</p>



<p>"This research is significant because this is the first drug of its kind to show an increase in healing and regeneration of the liver after major surgery," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/nyberg-scott-l-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Nyberg, M.D., Ph.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon and co-senior author of the study. "This discovery has the potential to improve the treatment of liver failure, increase the safety of liver transplantation for living donors and potentially avoid the need for a liver transplant in some cases."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers collaborated with researchers at <a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tubingen University Hospital</a> in Germany, who led the <a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum/pressemeldungen/628?press_str=">project</a>. "Our drug candidate would not only be an urgently needed treatment option in oncological liver surgery but, by enabling safe living donor liver transplantations, also holds the promise to overcome the major problem of organ shortage in the field of liver transplantation," says Lars Zender, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author of the study from Tubingen.</p>



<p>Liver disease remains a major health concern, <a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(23)00194-0/fulltext#:~:text=Liver%20disease%20accounts%20for%20over,for%20600%2C000%20to%20900%2C000%20deaths." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">causing an estimated 2 million deaths</a> worldwide per year. While healthy livers have a nearly unlimited ability to regenerate themselves, that is not the case for livers that are damaged. As a result, surgeons treating a patient with primary liver tumors are limited in how large of a section of the liver can safely be removed to avoid liver failure.</p>



<p>The study found that a drug called HRX215 inhibits the MKK4 protein found in liver cells. That appears to trigger the self-healing function of the liver, allowing it to regenerate. Before the drug was tested in 48 healthy volunteers within the phase 1 study, it was investigated in animal models. The preclinical study was able to show that the use of HRX-215 increased liver regeneration and prevented liver failure, even after the removal of 85% of the organ. The phase 1 study found excellent safety and tolerability of the drug in people. Additional clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of the drug in humans.</p>



<p>Researchers are hopeful that this discovery will one day create more surgical options for patients with advanced liver tumors by allowing more of the liver to be safely removed. It also has the potential to benefit patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-liver-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20352863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute and chronic liver failure.</a> This drug could potentially allow for successful <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/care-at-mayo-clinic/pcc-20384845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplants</a> from a smaller portion of a healthy donor's liver, and thus posing less risk to healthy donors. Often, this liver is too small to successfully take over the function of the full-sized liver removed from the recipient. The hope would be that this drug could allow for rapid liver regeneration, creating a new safe transplant option for people struggling with liver failure. This drug also could potentially eliminate the need for a liver transplant for some patients.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> is taking steps to bolster the medical marvel of transplantation while addressing the confounding problem of a critical shortage of donor organs. It created the <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/about/news/news-archive/faculty-feature-transforming-transplant-and-joining-forces-to-accelerate-discovery-to-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transforming Transplant Initiative</a> with a bold goal of providing organ transplants for everyone who needs one. Another objective is to eliminate the waitlist that has grown to more than 100,000 people in the U.S.</p>



<p>"My vision is to not just help one patient, but help the thousands who have end-stage organ failure get lifesaving transplants," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-00027293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C. Burcin Taner, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic surgeon who leads the initiative. Dr. Taner is also the chair of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Transplantation</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing shortcomings of organ transplant</strong>s</h2>



<p>The Transforming Transplant Initiative was created as a collaboration between the Department of Transplantation and Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>. The project seeks to overcome the shortcomings of transplantation, the greatest of which is the need for more organs. Researchers working to improve transplantation ask tough questions like, "Could we bioengineer organs to reduce or eliminate the wait list?"&nbsp; To answer that question, Mayo Clinic has formed a collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, pairing medical expertise with engineering know-how to make experimental organs.</p>



<p>"Bioengineering new organs is promising, but complex. We're looking at a research timeline of 10-15 years to potentially bring this new option to patients," says Dr. Taner.</p>



<p>This bioengineering research brings together 3D bioprinting, tissue engineering, biomaterials and cellular materials to grow humanlike organs.</p>



<p>The research is focusing on nine different bioengineering projects ranging from better ways of monitoring the health of transplanted organs to engineering complex organs such as hearts, lungs, livers and kidneys.</p>



<p>The Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics is supporting the project with biomanufacturing, stem cell technology and other resources.</p>



<p>"Regenerative biotherapeutics seeks to repair or replace diseased organs. As such, we are very excited to be part of the Initiative for improving transplantation," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qu-wenchun-m-d-ph-d/bio-20206516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wenchun Qu, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, the Jorge and Leslie Bacardi Associate Director, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics in Florida. "We hope to assist in the build out of this project by providing researchers, workspace, biomanufacturing capabilities and cell and gene technologies."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Making organ transplants more successful</strong></h2>



<p>Another challenge the Transforming Transplant Initiative is trying to address is graft failure or rejection of transplanted organs. Mayo Clinic's vision is to prevent the need for a second transplant. One research project is focusing on whether chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a>) could be used to control the body's immune response and prevent organ rejection. CAR-T therapy has mainly been used to treat blood cancers. Applying this technology to transplants would be a new, experimental use of CAR-T therapy.</p>



<p>"Some organ transplant patients have antibodies in their bloodstreams that increase their chances of (organ) rejection. Unfortunately, that makes it difficult to find a proper match," says Dr. Taner. "We hope research will show whether CAR-T cell therapy could harness the immune system to suppress antibodies that are causing rejection." Other Mayo Clinic goals include reducing the number of organs that are discarded and making more organs available through advanced preservation techniques. Another goal is to identify and treat disease early to prevent end-stage organ failure and the subsequent need for a transplant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Working together to improve transplant options</strong></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic leaders recognize that overcoming the complex barriers to organ transplantation will require powerful new collaborations. They are actively seeking new ways to work with experts in industry and academia that could bring new ideas, tools, specialized knowledge and energy to the field.</p>



<p>"Organ transplantation is one of the greatest accomplishments in modern medicine. There is also a lot of good expertise outside our organization," says Dr. Taner. "We welcome outside collaborators that could help us improve organ transplantation for patients."</p>



<p>It could take many years to realize the fruits of the Transforming Transplant Initiative. Nevertheless, Mayo Clinic researchers continue to work tirelessly to address the critical shortage of organs and bring the gift of organ donation to more people.</p>

<p>Nearly 89,000 people in the U.S. are on the waiting list for a potentially lifesaving kidney transplant, according to the <a href="https://unos.org/data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing</a>. The average wait for a kidney from a deceased donor is three to five years. People who receive kidneys from living donors also tend to have better outcomes, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shennen Mao, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon.</p>



<p>"People in need of a kidney transplant typically receive a living donor transplant much faster than a deceased donor transplant, avoiding many years of dialysis and its associated complications," Dr. Mao says. "On average, kidneys from living donors also last longer than those from deceased donors."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What led to policy change?</h2>



<p>Historically, people with diabetes have been prohibited from being living kidney donors because diabetes can <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-nephropathy/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354562?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cause kidney disease.</a> People with Type 1 diabetes remain ineligible to be a living kidney donor. By expanding eligibility criteria, there's potential to save more lives through increased kidney availability while maintaining a commitment to the safety and well-being of donors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the policy?</h2>



<p>The national policy allows people with Type 2 diabetes to donate a kidney if there is no evidence of organ damage or an unacceptable lifetime risk of complications. Mayo Clinic Transplant Center adopted its own more stringent policies to minimize potential risks for the donor. In addition to national criteria, Mayo Clinic patients with Type 2 diabetes also must meet the following criteria to be a donor:</p>



<ul>
<li>Be age 60 or older.</li>



<li>Have well-controlled diabetes and not use insulin.</li>



<li>If over age 65, can be using up to two oral medications for diabetes.</li>



<li>Not be overweight.</li>



<li>Have no family history of kidney disease.</li>



<li>Undergo a rigorous health assessment and individualized risk evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every eight minutes, a person is added to the national kidney transplant waiting list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Unfortunately, in this country, there is a large gap between the demand for kidney transplantation and the supply of organs from deceased donors," says Dr. Issa.Dialysis is an option for patients with end-stage kidney disease. Though Dr. Issa says a transplant is preferred — and having a living donor is best.</p>

<p>"Kidney transplantation offers greater survival benefits and increases the lifespan of people in need of kidney transplant," he says.</p>



<p>And that's a reason why it's important to expand the eligible kidney donor pool.</p>



<p>"Allowing people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus may open the door for some people who have not been eligible before to be potential living kidney donors," Dr. Issa says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Criteria for a living kidney donor with Type 2 diabetes </h3>



<p>Those eligible must be older than 60, have well-controlled Type 2 diabetes, not on insulin and have no family history of kidney disease.</p>



<p>"Any potential individual who would like to be a candidate for living kidney donation should undergo a very thorough health assessment and very thorough examination to ensure they are healthy enough," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>It's about safeguarding the potential donor's overall health — while helping close the gap.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The fall</strong></h2>



<p>It was Good Friday 2023. Mark Forbess was just leaving <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> after his first appointment as a new patient at the heart failure program, when everything went black.</p>



<p>"I found myself on the pavement in front of Mayo Clinic," says Mark. "I was emerging from unconsciousness. Everything was dark. I opened my eyes to see that my face was pressed onto the hot, black pavement."</p>



<p>People nearby ran to his aid as he experienced excruciating pain in his head, back and neck. From there, he was rushed to the emergency department in the building he was just leaving.</p>



<p>Mark had experienced a devastating heart electrical event.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where it all began</strong></h2>



<p>At around 33 years old, Mark was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)</a>, a disease in which the heart muscle becomes thickened. The thickened heart muscle makes it harder for the heart to pump blood.</p>



<p>"Over time, my heart health began to decline," says Mark. "The heart failure turned into devastating episodes of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation (AFib)</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ventricular-tachycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355138?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ventricular tachycardia (V-tach)</a>. During this time, I experienced four V-tach episodes which required my <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/about/pac-20384692?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)</a> to bring me back to life, in addition to eight cardiac ablations."</p>



<p>In the fall of 2022, he was referred to Mayo Clinic for a PET scan to look for other heart diseases. At the time, nothing was found that met Mayo Clinic's heart failure treatment criteria, so he was not approved as a cardiology patient. However, in March of 2023, after experiencing congestive heart failure while being treated at another medical institution, he was referred to Mayo Clinic again as a candidate for the heart failure program.</p>



<p>The following month, he was approved for the program under the care of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lyle-melissa-a-m-d/bio-20491562?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Melissa Lyle, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist</a>.</p>

<p>After the emergency department triage, Mark recalls his cardiologist saying, "Congratulations, Mr. Forbess. You just won a ticket to be evaluated for the heart transplant program." From there, he went through a battery of evaluation tests, which he passed, officially allowing him access to Mayo Clinic's heart transplant program.</p>



<p>"I knew that when Dr. Lyle told me I was entered into the Mayo Clinic heart transplant program that God was in total control of my life," says Mark. "He was guiding her and providing the confidence, from years of training, that I could live a happy life again by having a new heart."</p>



<p>Within a month, Mark was admitted to Mayo Clinic and waitlisted for his new heart. Transplant patients are ranked by necessity, and due to his condition, he was at the top of the list.</p>



<p>Mark had a rare heart deformation in which his left ventricle was very enlarged. This is considered unusual in HCM patients because their heart walls are usually very thick and the ventricles are small. As a result, Mark became eligible for a cardiac device — a small heart pump that helped improve his oxygen blood levels while he waited for his heart transplant.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Daytona 500 meets the ICU</strong></h2>



<p>In an effort to lift the spirits of their patients and encourage some much-needed exercise, the nurses on Mark's floor came up with some competitive fun.</p>



<p>"These patients are not your typical ICU patients," says Sara Vilela, registered nurse. "They are often walking and talking, something we are not used to in the ICU. This means we have to make sure we are catering to this special patient population and ensuring that not only their medical needs are being taken care of, but also their social needs."</p>

<p>The nursing staff set up a series of games from dominoes to a "Cardiac Device 500" footrace between patients around the hospital unit, measured by the distance they walked each day.</p>



<p>"It was a bit of a leap to think playing games at a time like this was appropriate," says Mark. "After all, we were in the ICU. When you showed up and participated, you were hooked. It was that much fun and necessary. No medical tests, no medicine and no bad news. Nothing but fun, and that’s always good for the soul. I participated in afternoon game sessions with other heart transplant patients, their families, my brother Jeff and the outstanding Mayo nursing staff. We looked forward to the opportunity to meet each other and focus our minds on something we had in common and away from our current health status."</p>



<p>The games were a big hit among the patients, inspiring much creativity, especially the races. They created names for their cardiac devices, team logos and even fake sponsors. Mark named his heart pump "Archie," after his father.</p>

<p>Mark recalls being barely able to walk a small lap at the beginning of this journey. However, walking more and more each day, motivated by a new heart and some friendly competition, he began walking about five to seven miles a day, even hitting a heart pump record of 10.8 miles.</p>



<p>"By hosting game times, these patients were able to talk to one another about the struggles of waiting for a heart transplant, but also the triumphs, such as beating their previous day's record of laps," says Vilela. "They connected over this unique experience and bond with one another, which resulted in a patient population encouraging each other, remembering they are not alone on this journey."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inspired by memories</strong></h2>



<p>Mark lost his wife of nearly 40 years, Michele, in June 2022, approximately 10 months before entering Mayo Clinic on the heart transplant waitlist.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-382338" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1.jpg 1512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>


<p>"I had spent many days grieving in the Mayo atrium over my wife," he says. "I wanted to change that to positive, fun memories instead by providing a little entertainment playing the beautiful grand piano and maybe brighten someone else's day." He pursued the opportunity to play with the encouragement of one of his nurses, Frances Ausley, and Rose Grace from the Humanities in Medicine Department. Grace is a concert level pianist herself who occasionally visited Mark in his hospital room to play the keyboard.</p>



<p>"Frances Ausley has incredible capabilities and a very hard work ethic while providing care to all those around her," Mark says. "Rose Grace encouraged me and gave me the confidence that I could play the piano under these circumstances."</p>



<p>While playing the piano helped, he still found himself battling anxiety and sadness around the anniversary of losing his wife.</p>



<p>"Managing anxiety on the one-year anniversary of my wife's passing was going to be very difficult," Mark says. "Wanting to celebrate her life outside, I was stuck in the ICU waiting for a heart, knowing that any high anxiety could trigger severe heart arrhythmia. Carolina Robles de Brady, a wonderful and thoughtful nurse from El Salvador, secretly arranged to reenact the dinner my wife and I had made on our first date — chicken cordon bleu with blueberry fluff as dessert. She asked me the day before about memories of a favorite dinner with my wife. I was pleasantly surprised as Carolina kept me calm while we celebrated my wife's life."</p>



<p>Later on, Mark would nominate Carolina for a DAISY Award, honoring nurses who go above and beyond to provide compassionate care to patients and families. She was selected and recognized with the award in December 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new heart, a new day, a new future</strong></h2>



<p>On July 14, 2023, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/goswami-rohan-m-m-d/bio-20432467?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Rohan Goswami</a> entered Mark's room. Expecting another donor update, the news was different this time. "I found you the perfect heart," Mark recalls Dr. Goswami saying.</p>



<p>"I never had children, but I’m guessing this is one of the most exciting pieces of medical news you could ever receive," says Mark. "After several months of waiting, Dr. Goswami is telling me I have a heart coming. It was an unbelievable experience. The sacrifice a donor family makes to give organs to another human being is one of the greatest acts of unselfishness and kindness a person can do on this earth. It's real, and it's effective. My donor family will be forever in my soul as I wake up every day thanking them in my prayers."</p>

<p>Mark received his new heart on July 17, 2023.</p>



<p>After more than 30 years as an investment banker, Mark started thinking about a long-term career goal he'd always wanted to pursue. Since childhood, he wanted to be a screenwriter and filmmaker.</p>



<p>"Before I entered the hospital for my transplant, I purchased screenwriters professional software used to write film scripts and loaded it onto my computer," says Mark. "I always wanted to produce films that would help people find true, long-term happiness in life. If I could write one particular story while waiting for my heart transplant, I would be a happy person myself."</p>



<p>Since leaving the hospital, he has achieved this goal by completing his first screenplay and has begun the process of marketing it to the film industry. As for his health journey, he continues to excel at cardiac rehabilitation, lowering medications every month as his recovery progresses.</p>



<p>Paying regular visits to Mayo Clinic staff since his transplant, Mark acknowledges that everyone he met while waiting for his transplant helped make his experience a good one.</p>



<p>"During this time, I would meet many incredible nurses, doctors, physician assistants, housekeeping team members, Food Services team members and a host of other personnel who took great pride in their roles," says Mark.</p>



<p>His interactions with all staff, even beyond his hospital room, became an expansion of his care team. Many share that Mark had just as much of an impact on them.</p>



<p>"The power of food and how it changes the patient experience by broadening the scope of meal service providing comfort, connection and nutrition is a component of their care," says Casey Wingerter, patient ambassador for Mayo Clinic Food Services. "During Mark's stay at Mayo, meals became a medium for connection, and connection was&nbsp;critical for his transplant journey. He healed while at Mayo, and it was the people that made the difference. That human connection is what he held on to and is why he became a bright spot in our staff's days as well."</p>



<p>Mark recalls how much Wingerter and her team truly made a difference. Before he left the hospital, he says the Food Services team gifted him a small suitcase full of his favorite gum as a way of saying thank you from Wingerter and the Food Services team.</p>



<p>"I firmly believe God answers our prayers," says Mark. "My hope is that my testimony can serve as a powerful tool for you to convey the profound significance of God in our lives. His presence can guide us through seemingly impossible challenges, which will lead to a truly long-term, happy life."</p>
