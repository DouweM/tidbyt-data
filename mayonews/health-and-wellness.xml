<p>Patients undergoing cancer treatments often use palliative medicine to cope with nausea, fatigue and other bothersome symptoms.</p>



<p>Palliative medicine is a medical specialty whose main focus is supporting patients and families/caregivers who need help managing symptoms related to cancer or side effects related to the treatment of cancer, along with other life-limiting diseases.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/barksdale-toure-m-d/bio-20517681">Dr. Touré Barksdale</a>, a Mayo Clinic cancer rehabilitation and palliative medicine specialist, explains the benefits of palliative care.</p>

<p>Patients with cancer not only have to worry about fighting the disease, but they also must battle the cumbersome side effects, like fatigue and other symptoms related to cancer and its treatment.</p>



<p>"Side effects from cancer and treatment of cancer, such as pain, delirium, nausea, vomiting and debility, can also contribute to their cancer-related fatigue," says Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Palliative care provides relief </h2>

<p>Palliative medicine is a crucial component of cancer treatment. Its main purpose is to improve the patient's overall well-being.</p>



<p>"Whether that's more holistic care through integrative and complementary medicine, more Western-based medicines, psychological care, music therapy, aromatherapy, Reiki, tai chi — we have lots of things we can do to help reduce suffering," explains Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<p>Palliative care is not the same as hospice care. The latter focuses on making patients comfortable and managing symptoms nearing the end of life when further curative treatments are no longer available.</p>



<p>"Palliative care, to me, is hope because what we're doing is we're improving your quality of life," says Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<p>This type of care is available at any stage of cancer treatment.</p>

<p><strong><em>Editors Note: September is Healthy Aging Awareness Month</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I've been hearing a lot lately about healthspan versus lifespan when it comes to aging. What do they each mean? And what is the difference?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> We get a lot of questions about what distinguishes between lifespan and healthspan. The simplest answer is to paraphrase a quote from President John F. Kennedy, "It is not enough for a great nation merely to have added new years to life — our objective must also be to add new life to those years." With lifespan, people are trying to add years to life. For healthspan, we are trying to add life to your years. We are trying to optimize the number of active, healthy and productive years that you enjoy. Lifespan refers to the total number of years a person lives, from birth to death. Healthspan is a concept that focuses on the number of those years that a person remains free of significant illness or disease.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-arlene-kogod-center-aging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging</a> at Mayo Clinic aims to improve healthspan through understanding the fundamental biological mechanisms of aging. It has dedicated research programs on musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neurological, immunological and metabolic health. The intent is to better understand the aging process to come up with interventions that have the potential to delay the onset of age-related diseases as a group. Whether it's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>, impaired bone health or kidney or liver function, most conditions or diseases are a result of getting older. In contrast to managing one disease at a time, targeting aging itself has the potential to postpone the onset of age-related diseases, extend healthspan and <em>reduce the length of disease and disability</em> in our final days.</p>



<p>There is a lot of interest surrounding the biology of aging. We often question what it is about getting older that leads to so many different health conditions ranging from osteoporosis to dementia, cancer and diabetes. We're starting to understand the biology of aging and how it contributes to these processes. One fundamental aspect of aging is a cell fate called senescence. A cell can become senescent in response to different forms of wear and tear on our cells. If a cell is unable to repair the damage, it can either die or transition into a state of senescence. Senescent cells, in a way, are a good thing because they help prevent the growth and spread of tumors. When we are young, they are effectively cleared by our immune system. But if they linger, they start contributing to deterioration, inflammation and age-related conditions. But they tend to accumulate as we age and if they linger, they start contributing to the deterioration and inflammation of tissues and cause age-related conditions.</p>



<p>As much as we're searching for the "magic pill," our studies show that lifestyle factors such as physical activity, healthy nutritional habits, social connectedness and sleep profoundly affect how well we age and extend our healthspan. What we've shown in our studies is that higher levels of physical activity and reduced calories while maintaining adequate nutrition have the potential to reduce the number and burden of the cells. Taking care of your body and incorporating some of these fundamental activities can improve your lifespan and build a foundation for healthy aging. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lebrasseur-nathan-k-ph-d-m-s/bio-20055350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Nathan LeBrasseur, Ph.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Director of the </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-arlene-kogod-center-aging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging</strong></a><strong><em>, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed that a person from Missouri has become the 14<sup>th</sup> person in the U.S. to contract <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bird-flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20568390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avian influenza</a>, also called bird flu. This is believed to be the first case where the patient had no known contact with infected animals.</p>



<p>"Why is this concerning? Because the more we see avian influenza move from a bird virus to a virus that can infect and be transmitted among mammals, the higher the concern of a virus gaining the ability to be efficiently spread from one human to another and cause serious disease," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/binnicker-matthew-j-ph-d/bio-20513862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Matthew Binnicker</a>, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>The good news, he adds, is that health officials are better prepared to respond to an avian influenza outbreak than they were to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a>, which was a brand-new virus. Bird flu has been recognized for several decades. Dr. Binnicker says that there is a candidate vaccine already available, which the CDC can share with vaccine manufacturers for rapid distribution.</p>



<p>When it comes to treatment, Dr. Binnicker says the world is also better prepared for bird flu compared to COVID-19. "The antivirals that we have to treat normal human influenza also seem to be effective at treating avian influenza," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Binnicker says a lot was learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, including how to control the spread of respiratory disease by: "staying home if you're sick, wearing a mask if you go out in public, getting vaccinated against normal seasonal influenza, so there's no confusion about what virus you might be infected with."</p>

<p>Studies have shown that dense breast tissue can make it more difficult to detect breast cancer early. Women with dense breast tissue are at a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer compared to women without, and that's why early detection is so important.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-new-hope-for-patients-with-metastatic-prostate-cancer/">New hope for patients with metastatic prostate cancer</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic is leading the way with a new treatment for advanced prostate cancer, specifically for prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (PSMA-positive mCRPC).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-using-proton-beam-therapy-on-the-heart/">Using proton beam therapy on the heart</a></h2>



<p>Experts at Mayo Clinic recently completed the first clinical trial in humans using proton beam therapy, a type of radiation, to treat patients with potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. And they say initial results are encouraging.</p>

<p><em><strong>Editors Note: September is Sepsis Awareness Month</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My 86-year-old father was recently hospitalized with a severe infection. We were told he's at an increased risk for sepsis because of his age and medical history. What are the signs of sepsis to watch for now that he's returned home?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Nearly 270,000 people in the U.S. die annually because of sepsis — more than the number of people who die from prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS combined. Yet more than 40% of adults are unfamiliar with the danger of sepsis.</p>



<p>Sepsis occurs from an infection and can quickly become life-threatening. When your body has an infection, the natural response is for the immune system to fight the infection. If the body creates too much of a response to the infection, inflammation can develop, triggering sepsis.</p>



<p>Any type of infection that occurs anywhere in the body can lead to sepsis.</p>



<p>Infections that lead to sepsis most commonly occur in these parts of the body:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/listen-to-your-bladder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bladder</a> and urinary tract</li>



<li>Gallbladder and biliary tract, which includes organs and ducts that make and store bile</li>



<li>Lungs</li>



<li>Skin</li>



<li>Soft tissues like fat or muscles</li>
</ul>



<p>There is a myth that only people who have been hospitalized are at risk of developing sepsis. In fact, 87% of cases originate outside of the hospital setting. Another myth is that sepsis is rare and only affects people with preexisting conditions.</p>



<p>Anyone can develop sepsis, but those at higher risk are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Adults 65 or older</li>



<li>Children under 12 months</li>



<li>People with weakened immune systems</li>



<li>People with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, lung disease, cancer and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-nutrition-tips-for-chronic-kidney-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney disease</a></li>



<li>People who have had a recent hospitalization</li>



<li>People who previously have had sepsis</li>
</ul>



<p>Symptoms of early sepsis can appear similar to other conditions, and survival depends on pinpointing the source of infection. Blood and urine tests and imaging scans may help identify the type and location of infection.</p>



<p>People at risk of sepsis or who previously have had sepsis should be proactive in talking with their healthcare team about the possibility of sepsis when they are feeling ill.</p>



<p>The acronym TIME is a helpful tool for recognizing and remembering the signs and symptoms of sepsis:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>T: Temperature</strong> — higher or lower than usual</li>



<li><strong>I: Infection</strong> — signs and symptoms of an infection</li>



<li><strong>M: Mental decline</strong> — sleepy, difficult to rouse, confused</li>



<li><strong>E: Extremely ill</strong> — severe pain, discomfort, shortness of breath</li>
</ul>



<p>Suspected sepsis should be handled as an emergency by calling 911 and going to a hospital, like you would do with a suspected <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/what-should-i-do-if-i-might-be-having-a-heart-attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a> or stroke. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/patient-stories/sepsis-diagnosis-prompts-quick-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Urgent response</a> and rapid, aggressive treatment increase the rate of survival.</p>



<p>Treating sepsis as early as possible is crucial to prevent it from worsening. Determining where the infection is and eliminating it is vital to keeping sepsis from progressing to severe sepsis or septic shock. Even with treatment, sepsis can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock, causing organ damage.</p>



<p>Close monitoring and treatment for sepsis occur in the hospital setting, typically with a combination of antibiotics, intravenous fluids and other medications, including vasopressors, corticosteroids or pain relievers. Supportive therapy, such as oxygen, kidney dialysis or mechanical ventilation and surgery may be needed to drain or remove the infection.</p>



<p>Many people who recover from sepsis return to the same level of activity they had before their bout with sepsis. Some people, especially those with weakened immune systems or chronic illnesses, may experience long-term effects.</p>



<p>Talk with your primary care clinician to determine if you're at increased risk of developing sepsis.</p>



<p>Take these steps to reduce your risk:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prevent infections.</strong><br>If you have chronic conditions, follow your healthcare team's directions to manage the conditions. Get recommended vaccines.</li>



<li><strong>Practice good hygiene.</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ws-of-healthy-hands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wash your hands</a> regularly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Clean and cover cuts until they're entirely healed.</li>



<li><strong>Know the signs and symptoms.</strong><br>Temperature, infection, mental decline and an extremely ill feeling — TIME —  are reasons to suspect sepsis and get help fast.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Editors note:</strong> September is National Suicide Prevention Month</em></p>



<p>Suicide affects people from all walks of life, cultures and socioeconomic statuses. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide rates</a> increased by 36% from 2000 to 2022. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/8-common-myths-about-suicide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide</a> is the second leading cause of death for people 10 to 14 and 25 to 34.</p>



<p>However, suicide is preventable.</p>



<p>Most people want to live, but they feel stuck because of how dire their situation feels and can't see alternative solutions. For some people, their ability to reason and problem-solve positive solutions is affected, resulting in impulsive decision-making.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to help someone with suicidal thoughts</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Whether you are a friend, family member, co-worker, teacher or community member, two crucial things you can do to help are:</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Reach out to a person who may be struggling with suicidal thoughts.</strong><br>It's as easy as saying, "I care, I'm here and I want to listen."</li>



<li><strong>Become familiar with suicide risk factors, warning signs and what to do to help.</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>These two actions can make the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/suicide-isnt-about-dying-its-about-perceived-relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difference between life and death</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Identifying suicide risks</h2>



<p>Risk factors do not cause or predict suicide. However, identifying risks helps you be aware of the possibility that someone may consider suicide.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Common suicide risks include:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Being the victim of bullying</li>



<li>Feeling hopeless</li>



<li>Feeling a loss of purpose</li>



<li>Feeling trapped and that the only way out is death</li>



<li>Feeling worthless</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/brushing-off-the-social-rust" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Loneliness</a></li>



<li>Shame, guilt and despair</li>



<li>Stressful life events</li>



<li>Trauma or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/speak-out-about-abuse-or-assault" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abuse</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are suicide warning signs?</h2>



<p>Making certain comments or exhibiting certain behaviors can often indicate a strong likelihood that someone is considering suicide.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Watch for someone who is:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Acting agitated, anxious or reckless</li>



<li>Displaying extreme mood swings</li>



<li>Giving away valued personal belongings</li>



<li>Increasing drug or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/recognizing-and-addressing-a-loved-ones-alcohol-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alcohol use</a></li>



<li>Showing anger or rage, or expressing a desire to seek revenge</li>



<li>Sleeping too little or too much</li>



<li>Talking about being a burden to others</li>



<li>Talking about feeling hopeless or having no purpose</li>



<li>Talking about feeling trapped or being in unbearable pain</li>



<li>Talking about wanting to die or wanting to kill themselves</li>



<li>Withdrawing or isolating</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How you can help someone who is feeling suicidal</h2>



<p>Becoming more aware of suicidal risk factors and warning signs is the first step. The second step is <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/suicide-crisis-develop-safety-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">knowing what to do when someone is potentially suicidal</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here are four interventions to keep in mind if you're in a situation to help someone who is feeling suicidal:</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ask.</strong><br>Directly ask if the person is considering suicide or wants to die. Avoid asking why. Instead, request that the person help you understand his or her thought process and current struggles. Thank the person for being honest and trusting you.</li>



<li><strong>Be willing to listen.</strong><br>Get involved and suspend judgment during your conversation. Be authentic, empathetic and sincere.</li>



<li><strong>Reduce risks.</strong><br>Remove or secure all guns, ammunition, and prescription and over-the-counter medications from the person's possession. Even acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be dangerous in this situation.</li>



<li><strong>Seek help for urgent needs.</strong><br>If someone verbalizes suicidal thoughts, has a plan, or tells you they will kill themselves, call 911 immediately or take the person to the nearest emergency department.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know about available resources</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Note these crisis phone numbers:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline</strong><br>Call 988 or chat at <a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">988lifeline.org</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Crisis text line</strong><br>Text "HOME" to 741-741.</li>
</ul>



<p>Everyone plays a role in suicide prevention. Stay aware of risks and warning signs, and do not hesitate to offer help when needed.</p>

<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 13% of women globally, causing hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, excess androgen and ovarian cysts, which can lead to infertility. PCOS is also a significant risk factor for endometrial cancer.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/pregnancy-related-heart-failure-is-under-detected-ai-enabled-stethoscope-helped-doctors-diagnose-twice-as-many-cases/">Pregnancy-related heart failure is under-detected; AI-enabled stethoscope helped doctors diagnose twice as many cases</a></h2>

<p><em><strong>Editors note:</strong> September is National Suicide Prevention Month</em></p>



<p>In 2021, suicide was the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S., claiming the lives of more than 48,000 people — nearly double the number of homicides. People of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds choose to end their own lives. That means that people of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds may be affected by suicide.</p>



<p>When learning that a loved one, friend, neighbor, work colleague or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/do-children-grieve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">child</a> has lost someone to suicide, you want to support them. Your first thought might be, "What do I say?"</p>



<p>Supporting someone <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/offering-support-to-the-grieving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grieving</a> a suicide loss can be uncomfortable and even a bit scary. The support you provide is crucial to helping them navigate this tragedy, and it's essential to their mental health. Be aware that those who have lost someone to suicide are at a higher risk of dying from suicide, as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to start the conversation about suicide</h2>



<p>People who have lost a loved one to suicide may consider themselves a survivor. They may be experiencing a complex range of feelings from grief to anger, shame and fear. Being present and showing you care — without judgment — plays a vital role in supporting them.</p>



<p>When talking with the survivor, show you still remember their loved one. Use the person's name, share memories and maybe even photos of time spent together. Talking openly about the person can help remove the stigma of their death. Sometimes, all you need to do is listen.</p>



<p>The survivor may ask unanswerable questions, such as, "I don’t understand how this happened," or "How could they do this to me?" Validate those thoughts and acknowledge that neither of you has the answers. Provide support with statements such as, "This is very hard for you, and I'm sorry that I don't have any answers."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Maintaining connection after loss</h2>



<p>Often, a survivor hears most from their circles of family and friends shortly after the death, but then the connections taper off. The survivor's emotions and feelings haven't tapered off. That's why keeping in touch is so important.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/grief-and-loss-throughout-the-holiday-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holidays</a>, anniversaries, birthdays and other milestone events can be particularly difficult for survivors because they conjure up intense memories and emotions about their loved ones. Check in with survivors around these times. A "thinking of you" card, email or text may be all they need to know you're there for them. They may also ask for space, and that's OK too.</p>



<p>Also, remember to include the survivor in activities. If you've frequently met for coffee, extend the invitation again. If they enjoy the theater, ask if they'd like to go to a show with you. If the answer is "no," accept it and don't push, but don't give up on them. The time will come when they say, "Yes."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be aware of suicide warning signs</h2>



<p>Because survivors are at greater risk of dying from suicide, pay attention to them. Listen to what they're saying and what they're not saying.&nbsp; And although it's uncomfortable for you — without judging them or minimizing their feelings — gently ask if they're having thoughts of suicide themselves.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some questions to consider:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you feel you have no hope for the future?</li>



<li>Do you feel you'd be better off dead?</li>



<li>Do you feel your loved ones would be better off without you?</li>



<li>Do you think you might try to hurt yourself today?</li>



<li>Have you had thoughts of suicide?</li>



<li>Have you been thinking of killing yourself?</li>



<li>Have you thought of ways you might hurt yourself?</li>



<li>What would you do to end your life?</li>
</ul>



<p>Setting aside your discomfort to ask a few questions can help the survivor feel supported and less alone, isolated and hopeless.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">If you're concerned for the survivor, here are some warning signs to watch for:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Acting anxious, agitated or behaving recklessly</li>



<li>Experiencing extreme mood swings</li>



<li>Increasing use of alcohol or drugs</li>



<li>Looking for a way to kill themselves like searching online or buying a gun</li>



<li>Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge</li>



<li>Sleeping too little or too much</li>



<li>Talking about being a burden to others</li>



<li>Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live</li>



<li>Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain</li>



<li>Talking about wanting to die or to kill themselves</li>



<li>Withdrawing or isolating themselves</li>
</ul>



<p>If you see these signs and are with the survivor, call 988, the national suicide and crisis line, a local crisis center or take them to the nearest emergency department.</p>



<p>Everyone plays a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/awareness-and-intervention-help-with-suicide-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">role in suicide prevention</a>. Stay connected with a survivor, listen to them, be aware of risks and warning signs, and don't hesitate to offer help when needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resources</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Note these crisis phone resources:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline</strong><br>Call or text 988 or chat at <a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">988lifeline.org</a>.</li>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a> and was just diagnosed as having <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic kidney disease</a>. I am disheartened by this news, but I also am determined to do more to improve my health. I know I may not be able to reverse my condition, but I am hoping to avoid <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hemodialysis/about/pac-20384824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialysis</a> or a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777#:~:text=As%20a%20three%2Dsite%20institution,transplant%20before%20dialysis%20is%20needed." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> for as long as possible.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Your determination will help you manage your chronic kidney disease by following recommended treatments and making lifestyle changes.</p>



<p>As you know, kidneys remove waste and fluids from the body through urination. With chronic kidney disease, kidney function is gradually lost. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/end-stage-renal-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354532#:~:text=End%2Dstage%20renal%20disease%2C%20also,to%20meet%20your%20body's%20needs." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">End-stage renal failure</a> is when dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to stay alive.</p>



<p>Similar to how high blood pressure is called a silent killer, many people don't know they have chronic kidney disease until it is discovered during a lab test for another reason. Because kidney disease usually doesn't cause symptoms in earlier stages, it often is not discovered until later in the course of the disease process. In fact, one in nine people may not know they have chronic kidney disease, but it affects about 14% of the population. That's more than 30 million people in the U.S.</p>



<p>Your healthcare professional will discuss what's best to help slow progression of kidney disease in your situation, but some recommendations typically include:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Follow a kidney diet</strong></h2>



<p>One key dietary adjustment to prevent the development or progression of chronic kidney disease is <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-can-extra-salt-hurt-your-kidneys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sodium restriction</a>. Some people cook with a lot of salt and often add more salt at the table. Many processed foods also have added salt.</p>



<p>Reduce sodium intake by limiting convenience foods, salty snacks and processed meats and cheeses. Overall, try to eat fresher foods rather than foods that come out of a can or a bag. You can still <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/recipes/kidney-renal-diet-recipes/rcs-20522796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enjoy many foods</a>.</p>



<p>Increase fluid intake as well. Lack of fluid can lead to disease progression and affect how well medications work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Address underlying conditions</strong></h2>



<p>Treatments for chronic kidney disease usually involve tackling the underlying issue. One of the most common causes of chronic kidney disease is high blood pressure, also known as hypertension.</p>



<p>High blood pressure relates to the pressure inside of blood vessels when the heart is pumping and when it relaxes. That pressure can increase as we age. A number of medical problems are associated with increases in blood pressure over time, which can lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a> and chronic kidney disease. Controlling those disease processes is extremely important.</p>



<p>High blood pressure responds to our lifestyle choices, including getting regular exercise, avoiding processed foods, reducing sodium intake and eating more fruits and vegetables. All of these things reduce high blood pressure without medications.</p>



<p>Sometimes those lifestyle changes aren't enough. These are the patients who need medications to help with blood pressure control. The patient with chronic kidney disease typically has a goal blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg.</p>



<p>Some risk factors for kidney disease we can't control, such as our age and race. Being Black, Native American or Asian American, for example, increases the risk of kidney disease. But some risk factors can be controlled. Managing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking/in-depth/nicotine-craving/art-20045454" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quitting smoking or tobacco use</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintaining a healthy weight</a> are important steps to help control kidney disease. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-ivan-e-ii-m-d/bio-20113830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Ivan Porter II, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>
