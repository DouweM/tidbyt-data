<p>Halloween is when kids wear their favorite costumes and go trick-or-treating for candy. Kids might bring home a bucketful of sugary treats, but it doesn't mean they must eat it all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can hear the excitement of Halloween in their voices as kids dress up in their favorite costumes with the hopes of collecting a bounty of candy. Now, what to do with all that sugar?</p>



<p>"I think the first thing I would do is give them a couple of pieces. That seems reasonable, but too much of anything can be a bad thing," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>She says to set a limit, then put the candy away so it is not easily accessible.</p>



<p>"We recommend that they keep a little bit of it, that's fine, but they don't need 5-10 pounds of candy each year because this is certainly going to increase the risk of cavities as well as other things," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>And help avoid an extra dental visit by encouraging good oral hygiene.</p>



<p>"If your kid is having candy, making sure that they are using good brushing and flossing techniques," Dr. Mattke says.</p>



<p>And, along with keeping a few pieces, consider having kids donate the rest of the candy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Some dentists collect candy and ship them overseas to our armed forces. And there are other locations where you could also donate the candy," says Dr. Mattke.</p>

<p>Stress is a physical and psychological reaction to a demand, and that demand can be anything, Dr. Debar says. Stress that is good for us and may even give us a sense of well-being is eustress, the opposite of distress. The same event—for example, getting married—might provoke either one, Dr. Debar says.</p>



<p>"It's about the perception of that stress and how your body is actually handling it," Dr. Debar says. "<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chronic stress</a> will impact every organ system in the body: You might feel anxiety, depression and digestive issues, for example."</p>



<p>Stress prompts a cascade of reactions within the mind and body as you mount a stress response, Dr. Debar says. Under normal stress, a person starts at a baseline of relaxation, encounters a stressor, the stress response begins, rises to a peak, and then comes back down to baseline.</p>



<p>Among the physical changes that may occur when you perceive a threat:</p>



<ul>
<li>The sympathetic nervous system and production of the primary stress hormone, cortisol, activate.<em></em></li>



<li>Thinking becomes negative as you experience or anticipate something bad. Attention becomes hyperfocused on what is happening.<em></em></li>



<li>The heart, lungs and muscles prepare for you to fight or run. There is increased heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate as the body needs to deliver more oxygen to cells. Muscles tense.</li>



<li>The digestive and reproductive systems aren't needed, so their activities slow.</li>



<li>The immune system turns its attention from fighting microscopic invaders such as viruses or cancer cells and goes into an inflammatory mode, increasing its production of proteins called cytokines that adjust this process. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>When someone realizes the threat has passed, the body begins to repair itself from this response and “tidy up”. It shifts to a repair, renew and growth state as the stress response is mopped up. Physically, breathing and heart rate slow down, blood pressure normalizes, you take more expansive breaths, muscular tension eases, the digestive and reproductive systems resume normal activity, and you may begin to connect with others to recount the threat you just experienced, Dr. Debar says<em>.</em></p>



<p>"If you go up in stress and then come back down, you have completed our cycle. There's no wear and tear, there's no damage," Dr. Debar says. "In fact, it's probably good for you because it leads to greater resilience. If you’ve ever overcome a stressful event in life, processed it fully and completed that cycle, then the next similar experience you have, you think, `Oh no, but I can do it.'"</p>



<p>However, when someone is repeatedly under too much stress, the ability to go back to baseline slowly starts to wane, Dr. Debar says.</p>



<p>"You can go up in stress and stay there, having a prolonged response. This is when you're hypervigilant: You're wired but tired, you're anxious," Dr. Debar says. "Or, life has thrown at you so many stressors, that you respond inadequately. It is the lack of recovery rather than the actual stressor itself that is critical. After a while, you may just numb out and show no response."</p>



<p>Sometimes people think it would be good to show no response, Dr. Debar adds, but internally the stress response and its cascade of internal activities are still happening. They are just hidden.</p>



<p>There are several signs that you may be in danger of stress overload and it is time to address it, Dr. Debar says:</p>



<ul>
<li>If stress feels unremitting and constant.</li>



<li>If stress feels uncontrollable and you're unable to relax or feel like you're on autopilot.</li>



<li>If you have problems regulating emotions.</li>



<li>If you start hiding from life and/or people.</li>



<li>You're experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches, chest pain, stomach upsets, problems sleeping, or getting sick more often.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Think about how your body handles stress, and how you handle it emotionally, physically and in your relationships," Dr. Debar says. "What do you do, what do you not do."</p>



<p>Chronic stress can have long-term health effects. People who feel ongoing physical symptoms or find that <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relievers/art-20047257?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lifestyle changes</a> do not seem to help should consult with their health care team, Dr. Debar says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> What happens during a spinal adjustment? Can professionals other than chiropractors safely do spinal adjustments?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong><span style="color: #202426">Chiropractors commonly perform spinal adjustments, also known as </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chiropractic-adjustment/about/pac-20393513?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><span style="color: #003da5;text-decoration: none">spinal manipulation</span></a><span style="color: #202426">. However, osteopathic doctors, physical therapists and medical doctors who are specially trained in manipulation may provide the service as well. The purposes of spinal manipulation are to alleviate pain and to optimize spinal motion in regions that are notably stiff or tight.</span><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Specific techniques may differ among practitioners. In general, during spinal manipulation, the practitioner applies a controlled amount of force to a spinal joint in the neck or back, either manually or using a device. Sometimes the force terminates in a quick, shallow thrust to the targeted joint. Alternatively, a rhythmic, nonthrust force also can be applied to improve joint motion in your spine and pelvis. The practitioner also may use a special table to help perform spinal adjustments more effectively. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Practitioners who perform spinal manipulation also may perform a massage-type technique called soft tissue mobilization, either immediately before or just following spinal manipulation. Like spinal manipulation, soft tissue mobilization also can be performed by specially trained chiropractors, osteopathic doctors, physical therapists and medical doctors. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Several types of soft tissue mobilization exist, but one of the more common approaches is called myofascial release. Like massage, this approach is typically performed on the skin. It combines slow, low-pressure glides over the affected muscles and connective tissues with higher-pressure holds as your body is slowly guided through specific movements. Like spinal manipulation, the purposes of soft tissue mobilization are to alleviate pain and to optimize movement, as well as to release tension in tight muscles affecting your spine. </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Spinal manipulation is generally considered to be safe when it's performed by a trained and licensed practitioner. Common side effects are soreness in the treated area, dizziness or tiredness. These problems typically clear up within one to two days. Serious side effects are rare but may include pinching of spinal nerves, resulting in leg pain and weakness, or worsening of a herniated disk. Thrust manipulation to the neck has rarely been associated with stroke.</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">In situations where spinal manipulation is considered unsafe, your healthcare professional may recommend alternative options, depending on the cause of your neck or back pain. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">These may include one or a combination of the following: specific home exercises and stretches for your spine, massage therapy, yoga, tai chi, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, oral medications, or spinal injections. </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">If you're considering spinal manipulation therapy, ask your healthcare professional for a referral.

<p>Developing personal health literacy — which is the ability to find, understand, and use health-related information and services — is something that can begin early in life.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic is truly an expert in healthcare. And we have an opportunity to be there talking with children, getting them excited about their health and empowering them to have agency over their own health and the health of their communities," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Dr. Mattke says these types of books provide accessible information on a wide range of health and science-related topics.</p>



<p>"I think there's a lot of health topics that children struggle to understand — anything from immunizations to why they're feeling sick, especially when children have serious and complex diseases," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Understanding their disease can help them feel empowered and knowledgeable about how they can participate in their care. But it's not just kids with serious health conditions that can benefit from this education.</p>



<p>"My children have read all these books and have read them multiple and multiple times. And so, they can help understand these diseases. It's inspiring their passion to learn more about science and learn more about health," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Which is another goal of promoting health literacy in children.</p>



<p>"We need to get kids interested in STEM — science, engineering, technology and medicine. And these are really important topics. And so, we're bringing these topics to kids to get them interested at an early age and inspire that passion.," says Dr. Mattke.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I've always been a high achiever, both personally and professionally. But I struggle with a whirlwind of worries and thoughts, constantly second-guessing myself and pushing for perfection. I've heard the term "high-functioning anxiety," and I feel like it is what I'm experiencing. How can I navigate and cope with this? </p>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>It's normal to feel anxious sometimes, especially in stressful situations. However, for some people, excessive and ongoing anxiety can be a challenge to control and interferes with daily activities.</p>
<p>There are several types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">anxiety disorders</a>. The term "high-functioning anxiety" represents people with anxiety symptoms while maintaining a high level of functionality in various aspects of their lives. Often, they are successful in their careers or other roles, yet internally struggle with persistent feelings of stress, self-doubt, and the fear of not measuring up. They feel extremely uncomfortable inside and struggle with significant self-criticism.</p>
<p>High-functioning anxiety isn't recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but instead is a subset of generalized anxiety. Many emotional and physical symptoms are associated with generalized anxiety disorder. The symptoms of high-functioning anxiety mirror many of these, but some may be more prominent.</p>
<p>Some symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder include overall general nervousness and worry. Other symptoms that may lead you towards high-functioning anxiety include internal struggles with:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Fears of criticism or significant self-criticism.</li>
<li>Fears of looking inadequate or foolish to others.</li>
<li>Feeling on the edge or on the verge of losing control.</li>
<li>Sense of impending doom.</li>
<li>Significant stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important that you meet with a mental health professional to talk about your symptoms and obtain an accurate diagnosis. Then, if it is determined that you have high-functioning anxiety, you can develop a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20350972mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">care plan</a> for having the best quality of life.</p>
<p>Counseling and therapy play crucial roles in helping people with high-functioning anxiety manage their symptoms effectively. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/psychiatry-and-psychology">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a> can help you learn to reframe your thoughts about life and transform behaviors that may feed your anxiety. Instead of being self-critical and looking for what could go wrong, you can be taught to manage your thoughts, seek solutions and guide yourself through anxious feelings.</p>
<p>In addition to therapy, other coping strategies to ease symptoms include: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating a support network.</strong><br />People with high-functioning anxiety may believe they must deal with their behaviors alone because they fear criticism or negative outcomes. A positive support network of people who care for you, regardless of outcomes, can help ease anxiety symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Establishing healthy boundaries. <br /></strong>This can help improve relationships with others and establish rules for yourself. The importance of saying "no" is often talked about as part of boundary setting. That's because many people overextend themselves — but some people with high-functioning anxiety also should embrace saying "yes" to opportunities that stretch their comfort levels. Their lives grow in experiences and fulfillment the more they face their fears.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting comparisons.</strong><br />People with anxiety tend to compare themselves to others, feel the need to improve and want to be more like someone else. Comparison can rob you of joy and contentment.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying core values.</strong><br />Some people with high-functioning anxiety become fixated on society-defined success, like having the "right" job, car, house and material possessions. Often, these items are only important because other people believe they are important. A therapist can help you uncover what is important to you outside society's expectations and align your thoughts and actions with your core values.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to accept criticism.<br /></strong>This can be difficult for many people but especially people with high-functioning anxiety. You may find yourself getting defensive. A therapist can help you identify ways to step back at this moment and evaluate the feedback neutrally without emotion.</li>
<li><strong>Practicing mindfulness.<br /></strong>This is the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/use-mindfulness-to-improve-well-being">practice of purposefully being aware</a> of and focusing on the present moment. Concentrating on one thing or moment can increase feelings of calm and peace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Medications can help some people with high-functioning anxiety, but should only be used in conjunction with other coping strategies and under the care of a healthcare professional.</p>
<p>Talk with your healthcare team about how you are feeling. They can connect you to a skilled mental health counselor or therapist, if needed, and assist you with coping strategies to manage your anxiety and lead a fulfilling life. — <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/linda-hubbard-lmft"><em>Linda Hubbard</em></a><em>, Psychotherapy, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire">Eau Claire, Wisconsin</a></em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parvovirus-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20376085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parvovirus B19</a>&nbsp;is the cause of fifth disease, a mild rash typically seen in children, although adults can contract the virus.&nbsp;Parvovirus B19 affects only humans. You can't contract it or transmit it to dogs or cats. However, different parvoviruses can affect pets.</p>



<p>"Fifth disease is a relatively common infection in childhood," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rajapakse-nipunie-s-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20308514?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse,</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;pediatric infectious diseases physician with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's Center</a>.

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality sound bites with Dr. Rajapakse are available in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Name super/CG: Nipunie Rajapakse, M.D./Pediatric Infectious Diseases/Mayo Clinic</strong>.</p>



<p>Adults infected with parvovirus 19 may have different symptoms than children.</p>



<p>Joint pain or swelling is less common but more frequent in adults. The virus also can temporarily stop the body from making new red blood cells, leading to anemia. People with sickle cell disease and weakened immune systems are at higher risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Rajapakse says parvovirus B19 spreads through respiratory secretions, such as contact with droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The virus can spread through blood and from a pregnant woman to her child. If a pregnant person suspects exposure to parvovirus B19, they should tell their healthcare team as soon as possible due to potential rare fetal complications if the mother lacks immunity.</p>



<p>"Parvovirus B19 is a viral infection that is quite common in childhood. If you test them, most adults show signs that they had this infection when they were a child," says Dr. Rajapakse. "The rash usually isn't causing too many symptoms, so it doesn't need any specific treatment. And as the child's body fights off the virus, the rash usually resolves along with that."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h3>



<p>There are no vaccines or medications to prevent infection, but there are ways to reduce your chances of getting infected or transmitting the infection to others.</p>



<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>



<li>&nbsp;Practice good hand hygiene by covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing.</li>



<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>



<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>



<li>Stay home and avoid others when you are sick.</li>
</ul>



<p>Parvovirus B19 affects only humans. You can't contract it or transmit it to dogs or cats. However, different parvoviruses can affect pets.</p>



<p>Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, got its name from being the fifth in a list of childhood illnesses known for causing a rash,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parvovirusb19/fifth-disease.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a>&nbsp;to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>



<p>In the U.S., the virus peaks in winter and spring. The CDC reports mini outbreaks every three to four years.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My spouse suffers from chronic pain after a back injury five years ago. The pain affects his ability to work and enjoy day-to-day activities with our family. Seeing him in pain and not knowing how to help is difficult for me. How can I support him on the challenging days when the pain is more severe and encourage him on the good days?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> For millions of people, living with chronic pain can significantly affect their daily activities, relationships, work and well-being. Chronic pain is typically categorized based on the duration of pain experienced.</p>



<p>The pain or discomfort people feel while recovering from an injury or illness is considered acute or subacute. Pain lasting beyond usual recovery from a trauma-related event or surgery, typically 12 weeks, is considered chronic. Pain can transition from acute to chronic, depending on a person's recovery process.</p>



<p>Chronic pain can cause a person to avoid activities that cause further pain. This can lead to muscle weakness, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/radiofrequency-ablation-pain-relief?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint problems</a> and being more prone to injury. These avoidance behaviors also can lead to psychological isolation and stress. Moving the body and being physically active are crucial for long-term pain management. Encouragement from family, friends and caregivers to stay active and motivated is vital in improving physical health and psychological well-being.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/8-tips-for-managing-chronic-pain?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Central sensitization pain</a> presents additional challenges, including mood changes and fatigue. Patients with central sensitization pain may experience heightened pain responses during physical activity.</p>



<p>It's important that loved ones understand the effect of chronic pain on a person's daily life. Not being able to engage with family and friends can lead to mood symptoms, such as anxiety, helplessness and hopelessness.</p>



<p>It's beneficial to encourage people with chronic pain to maintain a sense of normalcy, remain involved in social activities and stick to a routine sleep schedule.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/caregiving-self-care-during-beyond-the-covid-19-pandemic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">caregivers</a> should balance encouraging activity and enabling passivity, as helping can exacerbate physical and psychological limitations and dependency.</p>



<p>When supporting someone with chronic pain, here are some ways a loved one can help:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Understand the nature of chronic pain.<br></strong>Recognize that chronic pain differs from acute pain and can last beyond the expected recovery period. Be aware of the different types of chronic pain and their effect on your loved one's life.</li>



<li><strong>Encourage movement and physical activity.<br></strong>Motivate the person to do gentle exercises, stretching or physical therapy, even if it initially causes some discomfort. Gradually increasing activity levels can help improve pain and overall functioning.</li>



<li><strong>Support a balanced routine.<br></strong>Help establish a regular <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ways-to-get-better-sleep?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep schedule</a> and ensure the person is exposed to daylight during the day. Encourage healthy habits, such as maintaining a nutritious diet and avoiding substances like drugs or smoking. Understand that someone with chronic pain may have fluctuating levels of pain. Encourage them to participate in social events and integrate into family meals or outings when they feel up to it.</li>



<li><strong>Provide emotional support.</strong><br>Chronic pain can take a toll on a person's mental health. Listen when needed, offer emotional support and encourage open communication about their feelings and experiences. Help them seek professional help if needed. Understand that pain can be unpredictable, and the person may have good and bad days. Practice patience, flexibility and adaptability to accommodate their needs and limitations.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid enabling behaviors.<br></strong>While being empathetic is important, avoid reinforcing a sedentary or inactive lifestyle. Encourage independence and motivate the person to participate in their daily activities as much as possible.</li>



<li><strong>Stay informed and advocate for proper medical care.</strong><br>Educate yourself about the specific condition causing pain, available treatments and strategies for managing pain. This knowledge will help you better understand and support the person's journey. Help the person find healthcare professionals who specialize in chronic pain management. Advocate for their needs and ensure they receive appropriate medical attention, including seeking second opinions if necessary.</li>



<li><strong>Encourage self-care.</strong><br>Remind the person to prioritize self-care, including practicing <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/mindfulness-meditation-improve-your-quality-of-life?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaxation techniques</a>, pursuing hobbies and engaging in activities that bring joy and reduce stress.</li>
</ul>



<p>Remember, people's experience with chronic pain is unique to them, so it's essential to tailor your support to their needs. <em>— <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/qasim-raza-mbbs-md?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Dr. Qasim Raza</a></strong></em><strong><em>, Pain Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Barron</strong></em></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire">Eau Claire</a></strong></em><strong><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire">, Wisconsin</a></em></strong></p>

<p>Editor's Note: October 18th is World Menopause Day</p>



<p>Women typically go through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a> between the ages of 45-55.

<p>It's difficult to drift off into dreamland when dealing with hot flashes and night sweats. These are just some of the symptoms that women in menopause go through.</p>



<p>"I had one woman described that she sweated out her mattress, and the mattress molded because she was sweating so much at night. So, this can really be a significant problem, and it can disrupt sleep," says Dr. Faubion.</p>



<p>She says hormonal fluctuations can affect the sleep cycle and sometimes cause insomnia. Mood changes and anxiety also will keep some women up at night, counting sheep.</p>



<p>"We do know that hormone therapy does tend to help with a lot of those factors and does help improve sleep," says Dr. Faubion.</p>



<p>Setting up a sleep routine is crucial for menopausal women. Simple things like limiting caffeine and screen time can make it easier to fall asleep.</p>



<p>"Like making sure you get enough exercise but not right before bed, avoiding a heavy meal right before bed — those are some of the things that you can do to help maintain a good night's sleep," says Dr. Faubion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for better sleep during menopause</h3>



<ul>
<li>Avoid heavy meals before bed.</li>



<li>Minimize exposure to light before bed.</li>



<li>Avoid napping after 3 p.m.</li>



<li>Don't exercise before bed.</li>



<li>Create relaxing bedtime ritual.</li>



<li>Keep electronics out of bedroom.</li>



<li>Stick to sleep schedule.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My husband and I want to expand our family and are trying to get pregnant with our first baby. I've read about family planning couples can do before conceiving and learned about carrier screening. We don’t have a family history of genetic conditions, but we want to know if there is a chance of passing a genetic disorder to our child. What is carrier screening? And how does it help couples with family planning?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>When planning a family, you and your partner may choose to have genetic testing before having children to determine if you have a risk of passing on specific genetic disorders.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/genetic-testing-and-cardiac-conditions" data-wplink-edit="true">Genetic testing</a> is available to people who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Carrier screening is important in family planning as it helps identify genetic conditions that can be passed on to children.</p>



<p>Based on your family history or pedigree, a genetic counselor can advise:</p>



<ul>
<li>What type of genetic screening to consider, and whether your insurance coverage will apply to the cost.</li>



<li>What genetic testing may or may not determine.</li>



<li>Your potential risk of passing genetic disorders onto your children.</li>
</ul>



<p>People should consider genetic counseling and testing regardless of their <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/knowing-and-recording-your-family-health-history" data-wplink-edit="true">family history</a> of inherited conditions such as cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy or muscular dystrophy. Approximately 80% of children who develop a genetic disorder have no family history of the condition.</p>



<p>People receive two copies of each gene in their body — one inherited from the mother and the other from the father. Carrier screening determines if a person carries a non-working copy of a gene associated with a specific genetic condition.</p>



<p>People with one working copy and one nonworking copy of a gene are referred to as a "carrier" for the condition. They are typically not affected by the condition themselves. This is because carriers have one copy of the gene that functions normally, providing them protection against the condition. Most people are carriers of at least one genetic condition, and some are carriers of more than one condition.</p>



<p>Autosomal recessive conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, occur when a person inherits two nonworking copies of a gene — one gene from each of the parents who are carriers.</p>



<p>If a person is identified as a carrier, then their partner, egg donor or sperm donor is offered the same testing to determine if they are carriers of the same conditions. If both planned biological parents are carriers of the same condition, there is a 25% chance that their child may inherit two nonworking copies of the gene and be affected by the condition. Approximately 2% to 3% of couples are carriers of the same condition.</p>



<p>Although certain genetic conditions may be individually rare, collectively, their prevalence is more significant and accounts for more than 10% of pediatric deaths.</p>



<p>While carrier screening can be done when a person is pregnant, it is especially beneficial for preconception planning. Couples are empowered to make informed decisions about <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/genetic-counseling-for-family-planning" data-wplink-edit="true">family planning</a>, taking into account their carrier status for specific conditions. Based on the screening findings, some people may opt for alternative reproductive measures, such as in vitro fertilization.</p>



<p>Carrier testing may look for a single genetic condition based on family history. Expanded carrier screening looks for genes linked to many genetic diseases that are not only based on family history or ethnic background.</p>



<p>Carrier screening is now more accessible and affordable than ever before. Couples discussing family planning can ask their care team for a referral to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/medical-genetics" data-wplink-edit="true">genetic counseling</a>. Self-referral for the service also is available. Genetic counseling appointments can be conducted virtually with genetic testing performed through a blood draw or a saliva test.</p>



<p>After genetic testing, the genetic counselor explains the results and what risks, if any, have been identified. The information is shared with the patient's primary care clinician or OB-GYN.</p>



<p>Carrier screening is a valuable tool in family planning, <a data-wplink-edit="true" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/preparing-for-a-baby-together">offering couples</a> vital information about their carrier status for up to 500 genetic conditions and the risk of passing those conditions on to their children. It can help people make informed decisions about reproductive options and allows for early intervention and treatment if necessary. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/rebecca-jirik-cgc?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><strong><em>Rebecca Jirik</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Genetic Counseling, Mayo Clinic Health System, <a data-wplink-edit="true" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire">Eau Claire, Wisconsin</a></em></strong></p>

<p>There are plenty of frights to go around on Halloween, but a hand injury probably isn't one you'd expect.</p>



<p>"Interestingly, it's the fourth busiest holiday for hand injuries," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kakar-sanjeev-sanj-m-d/bio-20055340?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Sanj Kakar</a>, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic hand and wrist surgeon.</p>



<p>Dr. Kakar says almost one-third of those Halloween hand injuries are among kids 10 to 14. And most of them happen when people are carving pumpkins.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post.<br>Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/MCM-3-tips-to-avoid-Halloween-hand-injuries-SCRIPT3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"It's primarily stabbing injuries where the knife may slip, and, so, they can cut things like tendons, which are the ropes that help move your hands," Dr. Kakar says. "But they can also break bones, and also they can burn themselves, as well, with candles."</p>



<p>But Dr. Kakar says most of the injuries are avoidable.</p>



<p>"A lot of people might just go to the kitchen and grab a sharp knife. But there's good studies out there showing that actual pumpkin-specific carving knives [are safer], [because] actually the force needed to injure yourself, is higher if you use one of those than if you use a standard knife," he says. "So I would use a pumpkin carving kit, No. 1."</p>



<p>No. 2, Dr. Kakar says, is to let kids handle designing the jack-o'-lantern, but make sure adults do all of the carving.</p>



<p>And No. 3, make sure you're always supporting the pumpkin with your noncutting hand.</p>



<p>"So if you're right-handed, use your left hand to support the pumpkin and carve from the top down as opposed to the bottom up," Dr. Kakar says. "It's very easy for the knife to slip and go into your hand."</p>
