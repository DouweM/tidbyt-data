<p>A normal heart rhythm should beat like a steady drum. Atrial fibrillation is like a chaotic drumbeat.</p>



<p>"It's a bum, bum-bum, bum-bum-bum, bum-bum- bum-bum-bum. So what you're having is you're having heartbeats that are going sooner or shorter — bum-bum — or longer — bum-bum-bum, bum. And what that's doing is it's altering the ability of your heart to fill and your heart to pump blood effectively," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/desimone-christopher-v-m-d-ph-d/bio-20209047?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/desimone-christopher-v-m-d-ph-d/bio-20209047?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Christopher DeSimone</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.</p>



<p>That can put patients at greater risk of blood clots, heart failure and stroke.</p>



<p>"The heart is like a house. You have the upstairs, you have the downstairs, and you have electricity going on at the top of the heart. And it's coordinated to beat and pump in a fashion so that blood gets to the rest of your body by going from the top, down through the middle of the heart, out to the bottom of the heart into the basement. The top chambers of the heart are where the problem lies for atrial fibrillation," says Dr. DeSimone.</p>



<p>There are many causes, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or even sleep apnea. Often patients are unaware they have atrial fibrillation.</p>



<p>"Sometimes they'll describe to me that they feel fatigued. They're more short of breath. They feel like they're getting older. They feel like they haven't been as active. But really what they're feeling is not effective blood pumping," says Dr. DeSimone.</p>



<p>Treatment is individualized for each patient and may include medication; administering an electrical shock to the heart; or a procedure called catheter ablation, which scars the heart tissue that's creating the erratic signals.</p>

<p>For much of his life, Mark Kocak kept in great shape, lifting weights, doing aerobics and yoga, all while being an avid runner. But as he approached his 60s, Mark found himself dealing with high LDL (or “bad”) <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>. His primary care doctor recommended he go on a statin, but Mark refused, until one day, “I felt a little weird and thought maybe I was having a heart attack,” Mark says. Though the episode was a false alarm, it served as a wake-up call for Mark.</p>



<p>“My primary doctor, for the last few years, had been recommending I go to a cardiologist because of my high cholesterol and things like that, and I'd been kind of kicking the can down the road,” says Mark, now 62 and recently retired from teaching health and physical education at a junior high school in southwest Minnesota. “But when I had that scare with my heart, I decided I better see one. And I knew right away where I wanted to go, and that was Mayo Clinic.”</p>



<p>At Mayo, Mark came under the care of preventive cardiologist <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vasile-vlad-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20513797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vlad Vasile, M.D.</a>, Ph.D., co-director of Mayo’s Clinical Specialty Laboratory, who recommended he undergo ceramide testing. A novel assay developed at Mayo, ceramide testing can reveal more about heart disease and stroke risk than standard lipid tests. Ceramides are sphingolipids, found everywhere in our body. Though they are “ubiquitously expressed,” the test focuses primarily on three ceramides of cardiovascular interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The beauty of these three ceramides is they’re involved in different pathways,” says Dr. Vasile, who also serves as medical director of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-health-clinic/overview/ovc-20442224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s Cardiovascular Health Clinic</a>. “All of them are involved in plaque formation. Some reflect inflammation, some reflect the bad cholesterol, and some reflect coagulation or thickening of the blood.”</p>



<p>Jeff Meeusen, Ph.D., who co-directs Mayo’s Clinical Specialty Laboratory alongside Dr. Vasile, believes ceramides to be “a very biologically active group” of signal molecules. “So, whereas cholesterol is more or less a scaffolding, a building block that the cells can use to make other things, these ceramides seem to be specific actors in these different roles,” he says. “When they’re imbalanced they seem to have a stronger physiological signal that informs our ceramide test.”</p>



<p><strong>Moving beyond the gray area of risk calculators</strong></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic’s ceramide test uses liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technology to sort through complex molecular compounds and render an algorithmic score — a simple number that places the patient in a “bucket” of risk. For clinicians, it’s easy to interpret because this number is correlated with one of four risk categories, from low to very high risk. The test is also available to physicians outside of Mayo Clinic; one need only send in a patient’s blood specimen to receive their ceramide score.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“I WOULD SAY ABOUT HALF OF OUR CERAMIDE TEST ORDERS ARE EXTERNAL AND THE OTHER HALF ARE FROM MAYO CLINIC PHYSICIANS,” DR. MEEUSEN SAYS. “BUT BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONLY CENTER OFFERING THIS TEST RIGHT NOW, VERY FEW PHYSICIANS KNOW ABOUT IT. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE’S QUITE A BIT OF LITERATURE BUILDING UP IN ITS SUPPORT.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When Mark came to Dr. Vasile, besides high cholesterol, he also had stage 1 <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20045868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension</a>.</p>



<p>“His LDL level was 137, which was not really at goal,” Dr. Vasile says. “And he has a family history of premature coronary artery disease in first-degree relatives, so I ran the ASCVD calculator (a tool that estimates a patient’s 10-year risk of heart attack), which put him in a gray area of intermediate risk.”</p>



<p>Cardiologists like Dr. Vasile also use chest imaging and traditional blood tests to indicate coronary artery disease risk factors. But even this testing is limited, as are current risk calculators.</p>



<p>“We’re looking at many, many things, not just one parameter,” Dr. Vasile says. “With these calculators, we plug in all these clinical parameters, like blood data such as cholesterol, the demographics of the patient, and these calculators render a certain risk for developing heart attacks and strokes within a certain time span. But we know very well that these calculators are far from being perfect. There is a lot of criticism with such calculators because coronary artery disease and plaque formation are very complex and multifactorial processes.”</p>



<p>Dr. Vasile continues, “So, here’s this patient, Mr. Mark Kocak, who comes to me with a high LDL cholesterol of 137 mg/dL and a strong family history of heart disease. He’s also at higher risk because he’s a male. Should I target for him an LDL of less than 100, or should I be more aggressive and target an LDL of less than 70? The ASCVD risk calculator was not very helpful in this situation because it ignores family history completely, and so I needed more information.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Targeting LDL numbers to fit the individual</strong></h2>



<p>This is where ceramide testing becomes invaluable for Dr. Vasile. It’s a tool that helps him push through these gray area scenarios and better individualize treatment plans for patients. Mark’s ceramide score was zero, which placed him at low cardiovascular risk — unlike another patient of Dr. Vasile,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mayocliniclabs.com/2023/08/07/ceramide-testing-helps-reduce-risk-of-heart-attack-stephanie-blendermann/">Stephanie Blendermann</a>, whose score was an 8, which put her at high risk.</p>



<p>“So, his score was in opposition to Mrs. Blendermann’s, who had a high score and a similar family history,” Dr. Vasile says. “This told me that Mr. Kocak’s family history probably doesn’t have a significant influence on him. So, we jointly decided that because his ceramide score was zero, we shouldn’t be as aggressive with him as we were for Mrs. Blendermann, whose LDL we targeted at less than 70 milligrams per deciliter. His score told us we should target an LDL number of less than 100, which is the risk category for the average person walking the street.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Higher LDL levels are correlated with heart attacks and strokes; thus, the lower the LDL, the lower the risk of developing these events down the line. To reduce Mark’s risk and bring his LDL to goal, Dr. Vasile recommended a statin and medication for hypertension.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“WITHOUT THAT CERAMIDE SCORE, I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COMPLETELY SAY, ‘YEAH, I WANT THIS PATIENT’S LDL TO BE BELOW 100 OR BELOW 70,’” DR. VASILE SAYS. “AND TO REACH THAT SPECIFIC GOAL FOR THE LDL, IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS WHAT DOSE OF STATIN YOU ARE ON.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Though his ceramide score put him at low risk, Mark heeded Dr. Vasile’s recommendation to go on meds to further decrease his chances of an event. “If a statin and then a low-dose hypertension pill can keep a heart attack at bay, it’s sort of a no-brainer,” Mark says. “I agreed with him on that, and it was part of our preventative plan.”</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Dr. Vasile also urged Mark to continue his aerobic exercise program, weight training, and yoga, and had him talk with a dietician in Mayo’s Cardiovascular Health Clinic, who recommended he begin following a Mediterranean diet.

<p>As part of his preventative plan, Mark will be re-tested for his ceramide score on follow-up visits with Dr. Vasile so that any change can be caught early, and his treatment adjusted accordingly. Although he resisted taking medications for a time, Mark says, “I've always tried to be proactive. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I think medicine’s trying to head that way, getting in on the front end of preventing things, versus having to deal with the aftermath. But Mayo is just an amazing place, leading the way. My family is really blessed to have a facility like this so close to home.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Pericarditis is simply inflammation of the lining of the heart tissue, or the pericardium," says Dr. Cooper.</p>



<p>When the irritated layers of the pericardium rub together, it can cause sharp chest pain, a symptom that can often be mistaken for a heart attack, which can make it difficult to diagnose.</p>



<p>"Pericarditis has a classic type of chest pain, better if you lean forward and worse if you lay on your back," says Dr. Cooper.</p>



<p>"Most patients who develop pericarditis have had a recent viral infection, and those affect people of all ages, but especially young individuals, more commonly males than females in the general population," he says.</p>



<p>Other less common causes include chronic health conditions, such as kidney failure, cancer, prior radiation and atypical infections.</p>



<p>"The good news is that the vast majority of people with pericarditis recover and have normal lives with no further symptoms. A small percentage will go on to have a chronic or recurrent chest pain syndrome. Chronic pericarditis has specific therapies," says Dr. Cooper.</p>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carotid-artery-disease/basics/definition/con-20030206" target="_blank">Carotid artery disease</a>&nbsp;occurs when the blood vessels supplying your brain and head, known as carotid arteries, are damaged or blocked by fatty deposits. These deposits contain cholesterol that organizes as a plaque, which clogs or blocks the carotid arteries. This is similar to coronary artery disease, which reduces blood flow to your heart.</p>



<p>This blockage in blood vessels increases your risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/is-it-a-stroke-how-to-know-and-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>&nbsp;— a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or seriously reduced. When a stroke occurs, oxygen can't reach the brain, and brain cells begin to die within minutes.</p>



<p>Usually, carotid artery disease develops slowly. The first sign that you have the disease may be a stroke or transient ischemic attack, or TIA, a temporary decrease of blood flow to your brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is at risk for carotid artery disease?</h2>



<p>Your risk of developing carotid artery disease increases if you have a family history of the disease or&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/basics/definition/con-20026972" target="_blank">atherosclerosis</a>. Age also is a risk factor. As you age, your arteries become less flexible and are more easily damaged.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Other risk factors for carotid artery disease include:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Diabetes</li>



<li>High blood-fat levels</li>



<li>High blood pressure</li>



<li>Lack of exercise</li>



<li>Obesity</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/-/media/local-files/eau-claire/images/medical-services/pulmonology/upper-airway-stimulation-therapy.jpg">Sleep apnea</a></li>



<li>Tobacco use</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are treatments for carotid artery disease?</h2>



<p>Preventing a stroke is the primary goal of treating carotid artery disease. A treatment plan will be based on the degree of blockage in your carotid arteries and could include a combination of lifestyle modifications, medications and surgery.</p>



<p>Treatment for mild to moderate blockages may include lifestyle changes to slow the progression of damage to your arteries, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/a-smokers-guide-to-quitting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quitting smoking</a>, losing weight, reducing salt intake and exercising regularly. Medication to control blood pressure, lower cholesterol or prevent blood clots also may be recommended.</p>



<p>Your care team may recommend removing the blockage from the artery if it is causing severe narrowing or if you have already had a stroke or TIA.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">There are different options to remove the blockage from the carotid artery:</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Carotid endarterectomy</h4>



<p>This is the most common treatment for carotid artery disease and involves cutting along the front of the neck to open the carotid artery. The blood flow is temporarily stopped while removing the plaque causing the clog or blockage. At the end of the procedure, the artery is closed with a patch made from a vein, an artificial material or the lining of a cow's heart.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Carotid stenting</h4>



<p>There are two types of carotid stenting: transcarotid and transfemoral.</p>



<p>Transcarotid artery revascularization, or TCAR, is a minimally invasive procedure that treats carotid artery disease and helps prevent strokes. During the procedure, a small incision is made just above the collarbone to access the carotid artery. A tube or catheter is placed into the artery and connected to a transcarotid neuro-protection system, or NPS. This system diverts blood flow through a filter or basket that catches and prevents loose plaque or debris from entering the brain. After the plaque and debris are collected by the device filter, the blood is returned to a vessel in the leg. Then a wireless mesh tube, called a stent, is inserted to stabilize the blockage site and normal blood flow is resumed.</p>



<p>Transfemoral carotid stenting is considered when carotid endarterectomy or transcarotid stenting is not feasible. A tube or catheter is inserted in the groin. A wire and catheter are navigated to the carotid artery's diseased section. A filter or basket placed just beyond the blockage catches plaque or debris that becomes loose during the procedure before entering the brain. A stent is inserted to stabilize the blockage site, and the filter is removed at the end of the procedure. Transfemoral carotid stenting carries a risk of stroke during the procedure that is twice as high as carotid endarterectomy or transcarotid stenting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are there ways to reduce the risk of developing carotid artery disease?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To prevent or slow the progression of carotid artery disease, take these steps to manage your risk factors:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Control chronic conditions.</strong><br>Manage any chronic conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.</li>



<li><strong>Consider limiting your salt intake.</strong><br>Reducing sodium can help lower your risk of developing high blood pressure.</li>



<li><strong>Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-big-deal-about-the-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Healthy foods</a>&nbsp;provide valuable nutrients for your body, which may protect you from a stroke.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong><br>Being physically active can improve the health of your blood vessels and heart.</li>



<li><strong>Limit cholesterol and fat intake.</strong><br>This may help reduce the accumulation of plaque in your arteries.</li>



<li><strong>Limit your alcohol intake.</strong><br>Drinking alcohol in excess increases your risk for carotid artery disease.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight.</strong><br>Maintaining a healthy weight reduces your risk of developing high blood pressure, diabetes and other health risks.</li>



<li><strong>Quit smoking or don't start.</strong><br>After just a few years, a nonsmoker's and a former smoker's risk of stroke are comparable.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps:</h2>



<ul>
<li>Request an appointment with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/vascular-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vascular medicine specialist</a>.</li>



<li>Learn about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-other-arterial-disease">peripheral artery disease</a>&nbsp;— another type of arterial disease.</li>

<p>"Obesity has been a major health issue in the Hispanic population in the United States, resulting in health complications like diabetes and heart disease" says Dr. Leoni Moreno. He says there are many factors.</p>



<p>"This population has difficult access to healthcare, difficult access to guidance on prevention and management," he says.</p>



<p>That's where lifestyle changes can help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dietary choices, like fresh fruit and vegetables, can replace processed foods high in fat and sugar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Staying active can help lower complications too. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of regular exercise a week," says Dr. Leoni Moreno.</p>



<p>“It’s better to prevent disease than to have to treat the disease. We want to see these patients at the right time," he says.</p>

<p>A regular diet that's high in salt, fat and sugar can increase your risk for heart disease. Following a healthy diet can help the heart, control blood pressure and cholesterol, and lower the risk of Type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are strategies everyone can follow for heart health:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eat more vegetables and fruits: They provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber that protect your heart and help cut calories.</li>



<li>Choose whole grains: Opt for whole grains over refined grains to support blood pressure and heart health.</li>



<li>Healthy fats: Pick monounsaturated and polyunsaturated over saturated and trans fats to lower cholesterol.</li>



<li>Choose lean proteins: Lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy and legumes as protein sources.</li>



<li>Reduce salt intake: Lower salt consumption to prevent high blood pressure and heart disease.</li>



<li>Control portion size: Be mindful of how much you eat to avoid excess calories.</li>



<li>Plan daily menus: Emphasize vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats in your meals.</li>



<li>Enjoy occasional treats: It's OK to indulge occasionally, but maintain a mostly healthy eating plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>What may appear as normal symptoms during pregnancy may overlap with red flags for heart failure.</p>



<p>"(Symptoms can include) lower extremity swelling, shortness of breath with walking short distances or shortness of breath when laying in the bed flat on your back at night," says Dr. Adedinsewo.</p>



<p>Delays in diagnosis can be deadly. And some who are pregnant have an even greater risk of developing heart failure.</p>



<p>"There is a unique form of heart failure that occurs during pregnancy and shortly after having a baby called peripartum <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiomyopathy</a>," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "Black women have up to a sixteenfold risk of developing this condition, compared to white women."</p>



<p>Eating a healthy diet, exercising, getting enough sleep and not smoking can lower risks. Dr. Adedinsewo recommends attending regular appointments with your healthcare team and checking blood glucose and blood lipids.</p>



<p>"If we are able to test and evaluate a tool that can use something as simple as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983?_ga=2.204175184.1519000234.1596213841-659235982.1596213841?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EKG</a> to identify a woman who's pregnant and at high risk of having heart failure, we can initiate appropriate therapies and reduce the risk of dying during this time period," she says.</p>

<p>Walking is an inexpensive form of exercise that many people of various abilities and ages can do.&nbsp;What about those 10,000 steps a day that many fitness apps recommend?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Walking is perhaps the easiest, most affordable and one of the most effective types of physical activity humans can do," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>How many daily steps should you take? It depends.</p>



<p>"For a 25-to-30-year-old person, walking 6,000 steps a day is probably too little, whereas for an 85-year-old person, walking 5,000 steps is actually very good," he says.</p>



<p>And make walking part of your daily routine. Use the stairs, walk your dog or park away from the store entrance.</p>



<p>"People should be walking every day, even for a few minutes at a time, and even if it is just 15 or 20 minutes," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>Take a break from your desk and take a walk. It's good for your head and heart.</p>



<p>"Walking has many beneficial effects on our health — not just cardiovascular but even mental health," he says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I was recently prescribed high blood pressure medication. My routine was to take the pills before bed, but I'm finding when I do, I'm up all night using the bathroom. Does it really matter when I take the medication? Also, will I likely have to take this medication for life?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The most important thing about <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410">blood pressure</a> medications is to take them every day simultaneously and not miss doses. Taking blood pressure medication before bed is usually unnecessary unless your doctor has specifically instructed you to.</p>



<p>One of the most common blood pressure medications is a diuretic or water pill. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/diuretics/art-20048129">Diuretics</a> are very effective at lowering blood pressure and are often the first therapy prescribed as a blood pressure-lowering agent. Examples of diuretic medication include hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide. These medicines are meant to remove excess fluid from the body through urination, so taking them at night will keep you up and interfere with sleep. Diuretics should normally be taken in the morning, or, if taken twice daily, at least six hours before bedtime.</p>



<p>In the past, many doctors recommended taking blood pressure medication at night because heart attacks happen most often in the early morning hours. However, since blood pressure typically drops at night in people with normal and high levels, it is unnecessary to drop it further.</p>



<p>In addition, modern blood pressure medications are cleared from the body more slowly, so timing is less important. As long as the medication is taken regularly, preferably at the same time daily, it doesn't matter what the clock reads.</p>



<p>Discussing an alternative medication with your healthcare team may be valuable if you still struggle with excessive urination overnight.</p>



<p>As far as whether you will take medication for life, it really depends on your situation. Lifestyle adjustments can help lower or eliminate the need for medicine over time.</p>



<p>Consider <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20046974">these recommendations</a> to help reduce hypertension:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dietary changes</strong></h2>



<p>What you eat can have a direct effect on your blood pressure. The most valuable tip is to limit sodium. Reducing the amount of salt, saturated and total fat in your diet, adding in whole grains, low-fat dairy and increasing the number of fruits and vegetables daily can help maintain normal blood pressure. Overall, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/processed-foods-what-you-should-know">more processed the food</a>, the less healthy it is because more salt, sugar and saturated fats are added to make it more appealing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exercise regularly</strong></h2>



<p>Research shows that regular physical activity can aid blood pressure management. In overweight people, blood pressure can be reduced simply by losing even five pounds. The American Heart Association advises adults to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise each week and muscle-strengthening activity at least two days each week.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Limit alcohol and tobacco</strong></h2>



<p>Many people do not realize that alcohol increases blood pressure. It is best to refrain from alcohol; otherwise, women should limit alcoholic drinks to one a day; men limit themselves to two alcoholic drinks per day. In people older than 65, alcohol has a better chance of interacting with medications, particularly if more than one drink is consumed.</p>



<p>Quitting all forms of tobacco also can help improve overall health and reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reduce stress</strong></h2>



<p>Stress alone may not cause high blood pressure, but daily stress is more likely to elevate blood pressure, even if a person is already taking blood pressure medication. Stress can be managed in various, nonmedication ways, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and adoption of other habits, such as yoga, meditation and mindfulness. Regularly check your blood pressure and stay in touch with your healthcare team as you make lifestyle adjustments. Never alter or stop taking medications prescribed for you without talking with your physician first, even if the side effects are challenging. But, hopefully, with diet changes, exercise and less stress, you can begin to see your blood pressure number change for the better. — <em><strong>Dr. Michael Schuh and Dr. Sheena Crosby, </strong>Department of Pharmacy, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.</em></p>

<p>"Myocarditis is simply inflammation of the heart muscle. It affects mostly younger adults, and it's generally caused by a virus," says Dr. Cooper.</p>



<p>The most common symptom of myocarditis is chest pain.</p>



<p>"In an otherwise healthy person, sometimes — a week or so after a viral-type illness — chest pain will develop, sometimes with shortness of breath, and it can be very disabling. It can occur at rest or with activity," says Dr. Cooper.</p>



<p>Often myocarditis improves on its own with or without treatment. The treatment focuses on the cause and symptoms, such as heart failure.</p>



<p>"In that setting, we always treat heart failure with guideline-directed medications. But the chest pain specifically can be treated with anti-inflammatory medicines."</p>



<p>Because testosterone is a driver of inflammation, which can make a viral infection more severe, young men tend to be more affected and tend to have more severe diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Cooper says awareness of myocarditis symptoms and risk factors is important.</p>



<p>"If you develop symptoms of chest pain without any explanation or shortness of breath, particularly after a viral-type illness, it's important to seek medical care promptly," says Dr. Cooper.</p>

While exercise testing typically is focused on diagnosing coronary artery disease, a recent study from Mayo Clinic finds that exercise test abnormalities, such as low functional aerobic capacity, predicted non-cardiovascular causes of death such as cancer in addition to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular</a>-related deaths. These new findings are published in <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00284-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>.</p>



<p>The exercise stress test is noninvasive, easily available and provides important diagnostic information. In addition to the ECG itself, the test produces data on functional aerobic capacity, heart rate recovery and <a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/chronotropic-incompetence/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronotropic index</a>, the standardized measure of heart rate during exercise that reflects age, resting heart rate and fitness.</p>



<p>"In our exercise testing cohort, non-cardiovascular deaths were more frequently observed than cardiovascular deaths," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/allison-thomas-g-ph-d-m-p-h/bio-20053049?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas Allison, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, director of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/integrative-medicine-health/sections/tests-procedures/orc-20464680?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Integrated Stress Testing Center</a> and the study's senior author. "Though this was a cardiac stress test, we found that cancer was the leading cause of death, at 38%, whereas only 19% of deaths were cardiovascular.&nbsp;Exercise test results including low exercise capacity, low peak heart rate, and a slow recovery of the heart rate after exercise test were associated with increased mortality."</p>



<p>The study looked at 13,382 patients who had no baseline cardiovascular issues or other serious diseases and who had completed exercise tests at Mayo Clinic between 1993 and 2010, then were followed closely for a median period of 12.7 years.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that clinicians should focus not only on ECG results but on data in the exercise test results such as low functional aerobic capacity, low chronotropic index and abnormal heart rate recovery. Patients should be encouraged to increase their <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/aerobic-exercise/art-20045541?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical activity</a> if these results are atypical, even if the ECG results show no significant cardiovascular-related risk, Dr. Allison says.</p>
