<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart failure is a potentially urgent health concern for young <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-congenital-heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355456?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adults with congenital heart disease</a> (ACHD) that is often overlooked and undertreated, even as hospitalizations for this condition continue to rise. New research from Mayo Clinic shows that young adults in the U.S. living with congenital heart disease are at an increased risk of death or cardiovascular complications after being hospitalized for heart failure. However, study data published in the <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Heart Association</a> also found that patients who had been receiving recent cardiology care before a heart failure hospitalization were less likely to die.</p>



<p>"More than 85% of children born with congenital heart disease reach adulthood. They are likely to experience complications later, yet 61% of these patients beyond the age of 18 do not see a cardiology specialist," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/medical-innovation/burchill-congenital-heart-disease?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke Burchill, M.B.B.S., Ph.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. "These young adult patients have a strong need for individualized care pathways to improve their quality of life and monitor health issues like heart failure."</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality sound bites with Dr. Burchill are available in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Name super/CG: Luke Burchill, M.D./Cardiology/Mayo Clinic</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.118.008775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prior research</a> showed that heart failure hospitalizations of U.S. adults with congenital heart disease increased dramatically from 1998 to 2011. To further understand this trend and its effect on patients and hospital resources, Dr. Burchill and colleagues used national data to study a retrospective cohort of adults with congenital heart disease hospitalized in the past decade. The percentage of ACHD heart failure hospitalizations increased significantly, rising from 6.6% in 2010 to 14% in 2020.</p>



<p>In more than 26,000 unique hospital admissions of ACHD patients, 22% had heart failure and 78% did not. Those admitted with heart failure had a higher risk of death and other major heart and brain complications and used more healthcare resources, including rehospitalization and post-acute care services than those admitted without heart failure. However, people who had a cardiology clinic visit within 30 days prior to hospital admission had lower rates of death due to any causes at the 90-day and 1-year mark.</p>



<p>The ACHD patients with heart failure were nearly twice as likely as those without heart failure to be readmitted to a hospital, especially those under age 45, regardless of their type of congenital heart disease. Younger patients also required more medical or supportive care after they left the hospital before they could return home and care for themselves.</p>



<p>"Many of the patients I meet with ACHD and heart failure share a similar story of not having their heart-related symptoms taken seriously, leading to a delayed recognition and treatment of heart failure. The good news is that we can reset the course for most," says Dr. Burchill. "We have new medications to restrengthen the heart, new options for replacing heart valves without opening the chest, and low-risk treatments for returning heart rhythm to normal. Our goal is to shift the focus from heart failure to heart function and patient success in feeling better and living longer."</p>

<p>A salmonella outbreak in North America is being linked to cantaloupe, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/sundsvall-11-23/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/salmonella/symptoms-causes/syc-20355329?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salmonella infection, or salmonellosis,</a>&nbsp;is a common bacterial disease that affects the intestinal tract. Salmonella bacteria typically live in animal and human intestines and are shed through feces. Humans become infected most frequently through contaminated water or food.</p>



<p>Typically, people with&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-recognize-symptoms-of-salmonella-infection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">salmonella infection</a>&nbsp;have no symptoms. Others develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within eight to 72 hours. Most healthy people recover within a few days without specific treatment.</p>



<p>In some cases, diarrhea associated with salmonella infection can be so dehydrating that it requires prompt medical attention. Life-threatening complications also can develop if the infection spreads beyond your intestines. Your risk of acquiring salmonella infection is higher if you travel to countries with poor sanitation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of salmonella infection</h3>



<p>Most salmonella infections can be classified as&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-to-do-when-sick-with-norovirus-or-stomach-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stomach flu</a>, or gastroenteritis. The incubation period ranges from several hours to two days.</p>



<p>Possible signs and symptoms of salmonella infection include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nausea</li>



<li>Vomiting</li>



<li>Abdominal cramps</li>



<li>Diarrhea</li>



<li>Fever</li>



<li>Chills</li>



<li>Headache</li>



<li>Blood in the stool</li>
</ul>



<p>The symptoms generally last two to seven days. Diarrhea can last up to 10 days, although it may take several months before bowels return to normal.</p>



<p>A few varieties of salmonella bacteria can cause typhoid fever, a sometimes deadly disease that is more common in developing countries.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Causes of salmonella infection</h3>



<p>Salmonella bacteria live in the intestines of people, animals and birds. Most people are infected with salmonella by eating foods that have been contaminated by feces.</p>



<p>Commonly infected foods include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Raw meat, poultry and seafood</strong><br>Feces may get onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process. Seafood may be contaminated if harvested from contaminated water.</li>



<li><strong>Raw eggs</strong><br>While an egg's shell may seem to be a perfect barrier to contamination, some infected chickens produce eggs that contain salmonella before the shell is even formed. Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.</li>



<li><strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong><br>Some fresh produce, particularly imported varieties, may be hydrated in the field or washed during processing with water contaminated with salmonella. Contamination also can occur in the kitchen, when juices from raw meat and poultry come into contact with uncooked foods, such as salads.</li>

<p>"What happens in&nbsp;Dupuytren's&nbsp;disease is the layer of fascia that&nbsp;is underneath&nbsp;the skin in the palm gets thickened and contracted," says Dr. Noland.</p>



<p>That can make your fingers curl in. It's not painful, but Dr. Noland says, "It can cause significant functional limitations because the patients are unable to fully straighten out their fingers."</p>

<p>Dupuytren contracture is a condition that causes one or more fingers to bend toward the palm of the hand. The affected fingers can't straighten completely. It most often affects the two fingers farthest from the thumb.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Patients with advanced disease&nbsp;will need an intervention to relieve the contracture. There are several treatment options. An enzyme injection is a newer, less invasive treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It actually dissolves the thickened Palmer cords and fascia allowing the fingers to straighten," she says.</p>



<p>So how do you know if you need to see a specialist for your condition? Here's a tabletop test. </p>



<p>As Dr. Noland explains, "Lay your hand flat on the table. If you're able to lay it flat, then you probably will not require any intervention. But if you're unable to lay it flat because of the contractures in the fingers, then you would want to seek care with a hand surgeon <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dupuytrens-contracture/doctors-departments/ddc-20371950?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specializing</a> in&nbsp;Dupuytren's&nbsp;disease."</p>

<p>LA CROSSE, Wis. – <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/staying-safe-in-your-tree-stand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tree stand accidents</a>, <a href="https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/featured-stories/hunting-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firearm injuries</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/in-depth/heart-attack-symptoms/art-20047744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart issues</a> are the more high-profile injuries reported during deer hunting season. But some of the most common injuries occur before or after the hunt is over. Foot and ankle sprains, fractured ankles, ruptured Achilles tendons, and sore or overused muscles in the shoulders, arms and legs might have prolonged health ramifications.</p>



<p>"Oftentimes when we go out hunting, due to a lack of physical fitness, we overexert ourselves more than we're normally used to," says Katie McCabe, occupational therapist and ergonomics specialist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse</a>. "With that, we need to think about our safety as we manage our deer in the woods, whether it's a buck or a doe."</p>



<p>Once hunters have targeted and culminated in harvesting the deer, the task now becomes getting the deer back to the cabin or vehicle.  That’s when the fun might be over, and the hard work begins.</p>



<p>"I advocate the power position or tug-of-war position. We need to keep our head over our shoulders and always keep our arms close to our bodies," McCabe explains. "Anytime our arms are out away from us, it's going to be a lot more demanding, and we're going to have to use smaller muscles to do the work. That power position with a staggered stance allows the bigger, stronger muscles, such as our legs, to do the work. Just remember, with that power position, we want to keep our spine in neutral so we're maintaining &nbsp;the natural curves of the spine If we lose those curves, a lot more is demanded across our whole body."</p>



<p>She says the best-case scenario is to get a deer out of the woods going downhill. But you can have other things with you to get that deer to where you need to take it.</p>



<p>"For example, have along a deer-dragging harness. Those allow you to propel in a push motion while dragging the deer. If you don’t have one, bring a rope and find a tree limb. Tie the rope to the deer and limb, and with the limb in front of you, push using the power position. Also, we can have the rope over our shoulder or in front of our waist. This allows pushing the deer as opposed to pulling the deer having an arm behind our body, which might lead to fatigue and discomfort," says McCabe.</p>



<p>McCabe, a deer hunter herself, says hunters often may experience some low back fatigue and discomfort and potentially even shoulder and neck injuries, depending on their posture and how they exert themselves.</p>



<p>"Everyone's going to know their body the best and how their body responds to some overexertion," explains McCabe. "It's not a bad idea to stretch before you head out to the woods or hike out to the tree stand. All of our work is in front of our bodies. Try incorporating some stretching in opposite positions or opposite postures. Shoulder circles backwards and hamstring stretches can be easily done. Try and make the good choices of adding Gatorade or water so muscles and your whole body remain hydrated."</p>



<p>Whether or not you're hunting alone or with a party, it's always good to have a plan.</p>



<p>"Communicate that plan with your group, or maybe family or friends at home, regarding a timeline on your goals on when you want to go out and when you expect to be back. Let them know where your starting point will be. Always have a cellphone or a walkie-talkie available even if cellphone reception might be hit or miss. At least the hunting party knows where to find you just in case," says McCabe.</p>



<p>In 2019, over 15 million people paid for hunting licenses across the U.S. </p>

<p>During Thanksgiving, food often takes center stage at gatherings of friends and family. The focus is on turkey, pie and all the sides. But it also can challenge healthy eating habits.</p>



<p>Andrea Delgado, a Mayo Clinic dietitian, says that by paying attention to how much you eat and how often, you can make <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20047702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy food</a> choices during the holidays.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:01) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."

<p>Sit down. Enjoy your holiday meal, says Delgado.</p>



<p>"There's never an all-or-nothing approach in nutrition, you can still enjoy everything in moderation," she says.</p>



<p>Delgado says overindulging during the holidays can be a tipping point for some.</p>



<p>"Maybe now we have a new diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high cholesterol</a> or a new diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prediabetes</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> because, even though we only did it for a short period of time, it was enough that we were close enough to be diagnosed with these new conditions," she says.</p>



<p>One strategy includes weighing your options and making choices.</p>



<p>"Let's say I have a green bean casserole, which is filled with cream of mushroom and a lot of other ingredients, versus just a side of green beans. Your better option would be the green beans," she says.</p>

<p>But what about that pumpkin pie?</p>



<p>"We can still have a small wedge, but maybe we don't add the whipped topping or the additional toppings that we might add typically. It's not really cutting out entire foods. It's more how can we reduce the portion or what we add to those foods," says Delgado.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> The Food and Drug Administration recently approved two new COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. What are the recommendations for who should get it?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended the 2023-2024 <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a> (mRNA) vaccine for everyone 6 months or older. The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 vaccine</a> is strongly recommended for people who face the highest risk of experiencing complications from the virus. This group includes older people, those with compromised immune systems and chronic medical conditions such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, and very young children. If you're young and healthy, the vaccine may not benefit you as much, but you still should consider getting it if you live with someone in one of these categories or want to reduce the risk of a COVID-19 infection.</p>



<p>Overall, there is little to no harm in getting the vaccine for protection. For most of the population, the risks from the vaccine are much less significant than the risks from COVID-19 itself. While getting the vaccine does not prevent all COVID-19 cases, the latest vaccines aim to reduce the number of hospitalizations, severe illnesses and deaths from the virus.</p>



<p>Even if you have had COVID-19 previously or have been vaccinated, it is important to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine because the immunity from previous vaccines and infections decreases over time. Another benefit has to do with immune innovation — when the virus changes, it can escape the antibodies you’ve formed in reaction to the previous versions of the vaccine. By getting the updated vaccine, you are protecting yourself against the strains that are currently circulating.</p>



<p>The 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer target a different strain of COVID-19 than was in the original vaccine. Think <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a> vaccines — they are all flu vaccines, but the strains they protect against change year after year.</p>



<p>The updated vaccine targets the XBB.1.5 strain that has been circulating throughout the U.S. and most parts of the world since the start of 2023. The World Health Organization has labeled XBB.1.5 as the most transmissible omicron strain to date.</p>



<p>The updated 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine is the only COVID-19 vaccine currently available. Essentially, with the approval of the new vaccine, the older vaccines have lost their approval.</p>



<p>Other methods to protect yourself from COVID-19 include getting enough sleep and exercise. Avoid highly crowded indoor spaces and consider wearing a mask when you cannot avoid those situations. If you become sick, wear a mask to protect those around you and stay home to avoid exposing people at your workplace and elsewhere.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 vaccine and the influenza vaccine can be given at the same time.

<p>"Our goal is to transform the transplant practice for future patients. To do that, we are using technology and team science to look at ways to optimize donated organs, liberate patients from anti-rejection medications and enable donated organs to last longer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burcin Taner, M.D.</a>, director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Florida.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is celebrating the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of its first organ transplant, which was a kidney transplant from a living donor on Nov. 25, 1963. Today, Mayo Clinic is the largest integrated transplant center in the U.S. Mayo Clinic's transplant centers in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota combined have performed over 31,000 organ transplants.</p>

<p>"From the very beginning, organ transplantation has been exciting because it can allow a patient who has end-stage organ failure and who is extremely ill and suffering to get back to a normal life. We need to achieve that for more patients," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heimbach-julie-k-m-d/bio-20054676?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Heimbach, M.D.</a>, director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Minnesota.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Here are four promising ways transplant is changing:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Enabling more donated organs to be safely used.</strong></h2>



<p>New technology is helping ensure that more donated organs can get to the people who desperately need them. One of the biggest advances has been organ-perfusion systems. These mechanical devices enable donated organs such as lungs, hearts, kidneys and livers to remain viable outside the body for a longer period of time so that they can be used. It also allows surgeons to restore organs that would otherwise not be safe for transplantation. "Organ perfusion technology has helped us expand the donor pool and deliver lifesaving transplants to more and more patients, all while maintaining some of the best outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bashar Aqel, M.D., </a>&nbsp;director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Helping transplants last longer.</strong></h2>



<p>The average kidney transplant in the U.S. lasts 10 to 20 years, meaning transplant recipients are often faced with needing a second transplant. But what if those donated organs could last longer? Researchers are looking at ways to keep patients healthier so that these donated organs thrive longer. For example, one of the most common causes of kidney failure is diabetes, which is related to obesity. One innovative approach is to perform bariatric surgery ahead of the kidney transplant to reduce the chance of post-transplant diabetes. Efforts are also underway to improve how organs are matched with patients with the goal of minimizing the need for immunosuppression medication, which can have negative side effects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Identifying organ failure earlier.</strong></h2>



<p>The quicker someone is identified as being at risk for organ failure, the sooner they can begin to receive treatment in hopes of delaying — and potentially preventing — the need for a transplant. Researchers are exploring ways to identify subtle warning signs that this is happening earlier via artificial intelligence and biomarkers in the blood.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Bioengineering new organs.</strong></h2>



<p>It may sound like science fiction, but experts hope that one day there will be a way to engineer new organs using <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative medicine</a>. That would eliminate the uncertainty of organ donation and long waiting lists. Those efforts are still in the early stages.</p>



<p>While all of these potential advances offer hope, choosing to be an organ donor is a step people can take today to help save more lives. More than 103,000 people are on the waiting list in the U.S. for a transplant, according to the <a href="https://unos.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing</a>. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/living-donor-transplantation/overview/ovc-20545462?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Living donation</a> allows people to donate a kidney or part of their liver to someone in need. People also can <a href="https://donatelife.net/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">register</a> to become a deceased donor.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I'm pregnant with my first child, and I've heard a lot about pelvic floor changes during pregnancy and childbirth. I'm a bit worried and curious about what to expect. Can you explain these changes and offer advice on preparing for a healthy pelvic floor after pregnancy?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Pregnancy and childbirth are transformative experiences for a woman's body, affecting it in many ways. One of the areas that may be affected is the pelvic floor, which is the diaphragm of the pelvis. These muscles support the&nbsp;uterus, bladder, large intestine and rectum.</p>



<p>Often, these muscles are affected by pregnancy and childbirth, altering some of their vital functions. These can include fecal and urinary continence mechanisms and support of the vaginal walls and uterus. Less support can lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/pelvic-organ-prolapse-whats-going-on-down-there" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prolapse</a>, when organs shift within the pelvis. Trauma to the pelvic floor muscles and nerves also may result in pelvic pain symptoms occurring with or without sexual intercourse.</p>



<p>Here are some of the factors that can affect your pelvic floor during pregnancy and childbirth and how they can lead to pelvic floor disorders in the future:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Physical changes. </strong>About 50% of pregnant women experience symptoms of pelvic floor disorders even before childbirth. During pregnancy, women tend to gain weight — not just the baby's weight but also weight from the placenta, increased blood volume and an enlarged uterus. The extra weight increases strain on the pelvic floor muscles, resulting in an increased risk of urinary incontinence. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/constipation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354253?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Constipation</a><span style="font-size: revert;color: initial;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif"> is common during pregnancy, especially in the </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy/art-20046767?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third trimester</a><span style="font-size: revert;color: initial;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif">. The weight of the growing uterus and hormone changes can affect digestion, leading to infrequent or difficult passing of stools. Any related straining and stress can weaken pelvic floor muscles and nerves further.</span></li>



<li><strong>Hormonal changes. </strong>The body also undergoes significant hormonal changes during pregnancy that affect pelvic floor health. The placenta secretes the hormone relaxin to increase the flexibility of ligaments in the pelvis and soften the cervix. These changes are good because they prepare the body for birth. However, this can loosen the connection between the pelvis bones and lead to increased flexibility and instability.</li>



<li><strong>Medical and occupational history. </strong>Some women are more susceptible to pelvic floor disorders, and this risk increases with pregnancy. Women with a history of chronic constipation, connective tissue disorders or smoking are at increased risk. Women who are obese or have a history of repeated heavy lifting, either at work or through weight training exercises, also can be at increased risk.</li>
</ul>



<p>Labor and delivery are considered risk factors for pelvic floor disorders. Vaginal delivery, in particular, is regarded as the most significant risk factor. During childbirth, the pelvic floor muscles undergo tremendous stress, especially during the second stage of labor, when patients are actively pushing. This risk is increased with operative deliveries using vacuum or forceps.</p>



<p>Labor before a cesarean section delivery also increases a woman’s risk for pelvic floor disorders.</p>



<p>Some women's pelvic floors are more resilient and able to recover quickly, while others may be more prone to lasting issues. Studies show that the more vaginal deliveries a woman has, the more likely she is to experience pelvic floor dysfunction.</p>



<p>It's important to remember that pelvic floor disorders are not a forgone conclusion during pregnancy. Just as pregnant women take prenatal vitamins and avoid alcohol to lower the risks of some congenital conditions, they can take steps to reduce the risk of pelvic floor disorders.</p>



<p>Regular exercise and eating a healthy diet are good for your baby and good for your pelvic floor as well. I also recommend that you consider attending <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/classes-and-events" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">birthing classes</a> before childbirth. Often, these include stretching and breathing exercises to help coordinate the diaphragm and pelvic floor muscles during delivery. Pregnancy yoga and perineal massage can help prepare your pelvic floor by improving the flexibility and stretchability of tissues to limit your risk of perineal injuries at delivery.</p>



<p>When done correctly, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/kegel-exercises/art-20045283?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kegel exercises</a> strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. About 40% of people don't perform a Kegel correctly the first time. A physical therapist can help you identify the correct muscles if you are uncertain or have questions.</p>



<p>Finally, talk with your OB-GYN and healthcare team about your concerns. They can recommend stretches and classes to prepare your pelvic floor for childbirth. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/tarek-khalife-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Dr. Tarek Khalife</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato/services-and-treatments/obstetrics-and-gynecology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Mankato</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/new-prague/services-and-treatments/obstetrics-and-gynecology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>New Prague</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I'm reaching out because I'm in a tough spot. A close friend rode out Hurricane Ian in Florida last year and it seems to me that he's struggling now. He's angry and jumpy, while being numb to what's happening around him. He told me that he's not sleeping well, especially when another hurricane is in the news. Is it possible that he has PTSD from the hurricane? I'm not sure how to offer support without making him feel uncomfortable.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967">Post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, also called PTSD, doesn't just happen to characters on the screen. It's a normal, natural response to trauma and happens when the nervous system, which is designed to protect you from danger, gets stuck in the fight-or-flight response.</p>



<p>People may develop PTSD when they experience, see or learn about a shocking experience or event involving harm, threatened death or serious injury. Natural disasters, like experiencing the power and devastation of Hurricane Ian, can trigger PTSD.</p>



<p>In addition to natural disasters, other common events that cause PTSD symptoms include accidents, being threatened with a weapon, combat exposure, abuse or receiving a life-threatening medical diagnosis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PTSD symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Some people experience distressing symptoms for a short period after a traumatic event but get better with time and self-care. For others, the symptoms worsen over time and begin to interfere with daily activities and relationships.</p>



<p>Overall, PTSD symptoms usually are grouped into four categories:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Intrusive thoughts</strong><br>Recurrent and unwanted memories of the traumatic event can cause significant emotional distress or physical reactions. The person may experience nightmares or flashbacks, which is reliving the traumatic event again.</li>



<li><strong>Avoidance</strong><br>People with PTSD may avoid talking about the event or steer clear of places, activities or people that remind them of the event.</li>



<li><strong>Mood and thought disturbances<br></strong>This category of PTSD symptoms can mirror <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007">depression</a>, with people experiencing hopelessness, negative thoughts about themselves or others, detachment from loved ones, lack of interest in activities, emotional numbness and relationship difficulties.</li>



<li><strong>Reactivity</strong><br>These symptoms may include being easily startled, always on guard for danger and overwhelming feelings of guilt or shame. The person may be irritable or have angry outbursts. They could have trouble sleeping or concentrating and engage in self-destructive behaviors such as drinking too much or taking illicit drugs.</li>
</ul>



<p>It's important to note that some people may have a few PTSD symptoms but not enough for an official diagnosis of the condition. In these cases, treatment still can be helpful and can guide people toward self-care strategies and coping mechanisms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PTSD treatment</strong></h2>



<p>The good news for you and your friend is that PTSD is treatable, and many people manage it well or recover from their symptoms. Some protective factors are especially helpful during recovery, including having positive social support from friends like you.</p>



<p>PTSD treatment involves addressing both the physical and mental aspects of the condition. Treatment plans developed by a healthcare professional are tailored to meet the needs of each person.</p>



<p>Certain treatments calm the nervous system and help people regain control over their physical responses to triggers. These tactics help the person have an automatic physical response to tell their body that a perceived threat isn't accurate. Examples include grounding techniques, breath awareness and body-focused interventions. For example, short and shallow breaths can be signs of the nervous system reacting to a trigger. Through treatment, people can identify this reaction and learn to take slow breaths, which can calm the physical reactions.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Cognitive processing therapy</a> can help your friend identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs related to the hurricane. Other treatments, such as exposure therapy and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355973?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">eye movement desensitization and reprocessing</a> can help as well. Finally, medications may be helpful when used in combination with other treatment options.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Positive support</strong></h2>



<p>I encourage you to discuss your concerns with your friend. Focus on your observations of his behaviors before and after the hurricane. Listen without judgment and don't minimize his feelings. Suggest that he seek professional help to undergo a thorough exam and have his symptoms evaluated.</p>



<p>Finally, I recommend that you learn more about PTSD to get a grasp of what he is going through and why he may react the way he does. Remember that each person's reaction to a traumatic event is valid, and his trauma shouldn't be compared to another's as "better" or "worse."</p>



<p>PTSD isn't a sign of weakness. It's a normal response to traumatic events, like a hurricane in your community. With a combination of interventions and professional help, your friend can learn to manage his symptoms and regain control. <em>— <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jackie-richter-lpc"><strong>Jackie Richter</strong></a></em><strong><em>, Psychiatry &amp; Psychology, Mayo Clinic Health System,&nbsp;</em></strong><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse"><strong>La Crosse, Wisconsin</strong></a></em></p>

<p>"Look at the portion size. I think that is the most important," Dr. Al-Araji says. "In general, try to avoid processed food and rich, fatty food, and incorporate <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/beans-and-legumes/sls-20076082#:~:text=Beans%2C%20peas%20and%20lentils%20are,has%20more%20fat%20and%20cholesterol.?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulses</a>, greens, vegetables and fruit."</p>



<p>If health concerns such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coeliac disease</a> mean limiting or avoiding certain foods, that should be taken into account in dietary planning, she adds.</p>
