<p>Cervical cancer is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cervical-cancer#:~:text=Cervical%20cancer%20is%20the%20fourth,%2D%20and%20middle%2Dincome%20countries." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth most common cancer</a>&nbsp;in women globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In the U.S., cervical cancer is no longer a common cause of cancer death because of the use of a screening test called a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap smear</a>, which detects changes in cervical cells.</p>



<p>While the overall rate of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical cancer</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. is declining, the number of people diagnosed with late-stage cervical cancer is&nbsp;<a href="https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/32/9/1115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasing</a>, and rates among Black women are disproportionately high.&nbsp;<a href="https://ijgc.bmj.com/content/32/9/1115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a>&nbsp;also indicates that many women still are not being screened for cervical cancer.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/butler-kristina-a-m-d-m-s/bio-20110364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristina Butler, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gynecologic oncologist, discusses the tools available to reduce your cervical cancer risk, including a trusted healthcare professional, the HPV vaccine and regular screening:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tool No. 1: Find a healthcare professional you trust.</h2>



<p>Many people in the U.S. don't have a healthcare professional they see regularly. The causes are complicated and include being underinsured, barriers related to cost and transportation, and mistrust in the healthcare system — all of which can lead to late-stage cervical cancer diagnoses and poorer outcomes.</p>



<p>"People need to find a care professional they're comfortable with. Catching changes in the cervix and cancers early improves long-term outcomes," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>If you don’t visit a healthcare professional regularly due to cost or lack of insurance, you may be eligible for free or low-cost screening through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program</a> NBCCEDP). A program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the NBCCEDP helps people with low incomes who do not have adequate insurance gain access to breast and cervical cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp/screenings.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Find a screening program near you</a>.</p>



<p>Your local health department or women's clinic may also provide free or low-cost options for screening. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDC website</a>&nbsp;offers lists of health departments that you can search to find resources in your area.</p>



<p>Dr. Butler recommends establishing a relationship with a healthcare professional you see for a checkup once a year — a primary care provider or a gynecologist, a doctor who specializes in female reproductive health. "During that visit, it’s important to discuss symptoms and anything you think may be out of the ordinary related to the genital area. That discussion might prompt the need for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pelvic-exam/about/pac-20385135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pelvic exam</a>. A person should be comfortable requesting an exam because, in many instances, it's hard to define normal."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tool No. 2: Get the HPV vaccine for yourself and your children.</h2>



<p>Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV</a>&nbsp;(human papillomavirus) infection, which can also cause cancers of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vagina</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vulvar-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20368051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vulva</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/mens-health/in-depth/penis-health/art-20046175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">penis</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/symptoms-causes/syc-20354171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head and neck</a>. Getting vaccinated against HPV is your best protection against HPV infection and cervical cancer.</p>



<p>"You can receive the vaccine at age 9, and you may still get some protection if you get it up to age 45. With this vaccine, we're hoping to eradicate cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>The CDC<a>&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommends</a>&nbsp;the HPV vaccine for children aged 11 and those under age 26 who were not vaccinated. People younger than 15 can be vaccinated with two doses, six to 12 months apart. People who start the vaccine series later, after age 15, should get three vaccine doses over six months.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/03/02/dear-mayo-clinic-adults-up-to-age-45-and-at-risk-for-hpv-infection-can-get-vaccine/">Adults 27 to 45</a>&nbsp;who were not vaccinated should talk to their healthcare professional about the HPV vaccine. Dr. Butler says the vaccine can provide benefits even after you have been diagnosed with changes to cells in your cervix that make them more likely to develop into cancer or you have been exposed to HPV.</p>



<p>"The HPV vaccine is exciting because it gives us an opportunity to prevent cancer," says Dr. Butler. “We can reduce the risk of several cancers with this vaccine."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tool No. 3: Start cervical cancer screening at age 21 and follow a schedule.</h2>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic, we recommend that cervical cancer screening start at age 21 and continue every three to five years, depending on the type of screening performed," says Dr. Butler. "At the time of screening, we do a thorough examination to evaluate multiple areas. We are looking at the vulva, the vagina, the urethral area and the anal area for anything unusual."</p>



<p>In addition to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pelvic-exam/about/pac-20385135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pelvic exam</a>, your healthcare professional will conduct a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap smear</a>, which involves collecting cells from your cervix to detect any changes. Mayo Clinic recommends repeating Pap testing every three years for women ages 21 to 65.</p>



<p>Dr. Butler says you should continue screening following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a>, particularly if you have any bleeding. "At 65, if you have had normal screening test results for quite some time, you can have a discussion with your healthcare professional about discontinuing," she says. "But we know that 16% of cervical cancer happens in women over the age of 65."</p>



<p>Women age 30 or older can consider Pap testing every five years if the procedure is combined with an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hpv-test/about/pac-20394355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV test</a>. Knowing whether you have a type of HPV that puts you at high risk of cervical cancer allows you and your care team to decide on the next steps, which may include monitoring or further testing.</p>



<p>Your healthcare professional may recommend a different screening schedule depending on your risk factors and history of screening results. "A patient may have high-risk factors that require more frequent screening. Examples include people with weakened immune systems or people with a history of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/expert-answers/cervical-dysplasia/faq-20058142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical dysplasia</a>," says Dr. Butler. "Following hysterectomy, most people no longer need cervical cancer screening. But if they have high-risk factors, they should speak to their doctor because they might need screening with a Pap smear that can be performed in the vaginal area since there is no longer a cervix."</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Kristina Butler talks about cervical cancer in this Mayo Clinic Minute</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you've been diagnosed with cervical cancer, Dr. Butler says new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatments</a>&nbsp;are giving more people hope.</p>



<p>"For people with advanced and recurrent cervical cancer, we use chemotherapy and a targeted therapy drug called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/bevacizumab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bevacizumab</a>, which works by blocking a protein called VEGF," she says. "For some people whose cancer has markers for the protein PD-L1, we're able to use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/pembrolizumab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pembrolizumab</a>&nbsp;— an immunotherapy drug called an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune checkpoint inhibitor</a>." Pembrolizumab works by binding to the protein PD-1 on the surface of T cells (a type of immune cell). This prevents the cancer cells from weakening the immune system, which can then kill the cancer cells.</p>



<p>"The development of these additional drugs has absolutely improved outcomes," says Dr. Butler.</p>

He says the goal of screening is to detect prostate cancer early, when it's still confined to the prostate gland and has the best chance for successful treatment.</p>



<p>"It's important to get adequate screening, and screening for prostate cancer is relatively simple. You can have a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/psa-test/about/pac-20384731?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test</a> with your primary care doctor once a year, and with this, you can tailor adequate procedures based on your age and other risk factors," says Dr. Vargas.</p>



<p>The prostate-specific antigen test is a blood test used to measure the amount of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. High levels may indicate the presence of cancer. Other conditions also may increase this level. It's important to discuss with your healthcare professional if the prostate-specific antigen test is right for you based on your personal risk level and age.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is at risk?</h2>



<p>Risk factors include age, family history and race. The most common age is around 50 or older.</p>



<p>If you have a blood relative who has or has had prostate cancer or a family history of genes that increase the risk of breast cancer — BRCA1 or BRCA2 — or a strong family history of breast cancer, your risk of prostate cancer may be higher. In the U.S., prostate cancer is deadlier for Black men than men of other races, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/prostate/prostate-cancer-health-tip-sheet.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. They are more likely to get prostate cancer and more than twice as likely to die from prostate cancer than other men.</p>



<p>"Early detection is very important. If we can find prostate cancer early, it is treatable and curable, " says Dr. Vargas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Active surveillance</h2>



<p>Not all prostate cancers need to be treated, says Dr. Vargas. Some cancers can remain under <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/active-surveillance-for-prostate-cancer/about/pac-20384946?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active surveillance</a>.</p>



<p>"When we find very early prostate cancer, we can watch it for many years. And in case that prostate cancer becomes more aggressive, then we can treat it there. The problem is when you are not screened, and then you find a very aggressive prostate cancer that is still localized or it has already metastasized, in which case, the chances of controlling the cancer, curing you and saving your life are much lower."</p>



<p>In active surveillance, regular follow-up tests may be performed to monitor the progression of your cancer.</p>



<p>"That's why screening is very important and why we encourage screening for prostate cancer. It doesn't mean that you must be treated. If prostate cancer is found, we can then determine what is the most appropriate course of action for your prostate cancer based on your age and your risk group."</p>

<p>Along with active surveillance, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20353097?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full range</a> of treatments for prostate cancer is available, including radiation therapy; hormone therapy; cryosurgery; chemotherapy; and surgery, including robotic prostatectomy.</p>



<p><strong>"</strong>One of the things that has really changed over the last few years is the management of radiation with patients with metastatic prostate cancer," says Dr. Vargas. "We have found that many patients with metastatic prostate cancer still benefit from radiation to the prostate."</p>



<p>"And we have also found that many patients who have just a few sites of metastatic disease, meaning that the cancer is not widely spread, can also benefit from aggressive treatment where we do a combination of radiation therapy and systematic therapy to put you back in remission where disease cannot be found, and extend your life."</p>

Dr. Vargas says proton therapy is effectively used to treat patients with prostate cancer.</p>



<p>"It's a very localized treatment that allows us to treat the prostate, localizing the treatment to the prostate, hoping to minimize significant adverse events that may happen from the treatment," says Dr. Vargas.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><em>On the brink of losing her battle with acute myeloid leukemia, Shannon Camlek arrived at Mayo Clinic as a last hope. Her chances didn’t look good, but with the help of specialized genetic testing, particularly FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) studies, doctors were able to detect the specific gene mutations responsible for her symptoms and disease. The test results also helped Shannon’s care team target her treatment accordingly, and finally put an end to what Shannon likens as starring in her own personal horror movie while in search of hope and healing.</em></h5>



<p>"Her white blood cell count was very high and there were all these leukemia cells (blasts) in her blood." This is how&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/gangat-naseema-m-b-b-s/bio-20055150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naseema Gangat, M.B.B.S.</a>, a consultant in Mayo Clinic’s Division of Hematology, describes patient Shannon Camlek’s condition when she first arrived at Mayo Clinic’s Rochester campus. It was April of 2018, and Shannon had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Her condition had deteriorated so dramatically that Shannon’s care team at Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, urged her to come to Mayo Clinic as a last-ditch effort to extend her life.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="264" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Dr_Gangat_and_Shannon-264x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-380392" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Dr_Gangat_and_Shannon-264x300.jpg 264w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Dr_Gangat_and_Shannon-901x1024.jpg 901w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Dr_Gangat_and_Shannon-768x873.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Dr_Gangat_and_Shannon-1352x1536.jpg 1352w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Dr_Gangat_and_Shannon.jpg 1671w" sizes="(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Gangat and Shannon</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To determine the appropriate treatment for Shannon, Dr. Gangat ordered a second bone marrow biopsy, posthaste, after the first one was lost in transit from Sacred Heart. "I was not in good shape," says Shannon, 55, who resides in Fall Creek, Wisconsin, with her husband Tim. "My platelets were down, my white blood cell count up. I was in what they call ‘blast crisis,’ and the genetic tests from the bone marrow sample held the answers to my treatment plan. So, getting those results was a matter of life and death."</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>DR. GANGAT ADDS, “WE NEEDED THE BONE MARROW RESULTS TO ACCURATELY PROGNOSTICATE OR RISK-CLASSIFY THE DISEASE. IN SHANNON’S CASE, THE CHROMOSOME TESTS WERE NORMAL, BUT HER FISH STUDY, WHICH IS ANOTHER GENETIC TEST, REVEALED AN ABNORMALITY WITH THREE COPIES OF THIS GENE CALLED KAT6A, AND MUTATION ANALYSIS HAD THE FLT3-ITD MUTATION.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) study is a highly sensitive test done in Mayo Clinic’s Genomics Laboratory. The test performed on Shannon ran 16 different probe sets, including the gene region KAT6A, which is how the third copy of the mutation was discovered (the norm is two copies).</p>



<p>The FLT3-ITD mutation put Shannon’s leukemia in the high-risk category, which meant a stem cell transplant was her only viable treatment option. The presence of the FLT3-ITD mutation also provided the opportunity to use FLT3-directed medications. Foremost, given Shannon’s presentation with "blast crisis," Dr. Gangat ordered a&nbsp;<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22926-leukapheresis">leukapheresis</a>, a procedure to remove white blood cells and help prevent organ damage. Shannon was then moved into an induction chemotherapy program consisting of cytarabine (7) + daunorubicin (3) plus.</p>



<p>"We performed disease assessment about a month after treatment was started," Dr. Gangat says. "And there still were about 4% of leukemia cells remaining, which we call ‘persistent AML.’ So, we did another round of the same treatment to enable the eradication of all leukemia cells. The stem cell transplant doesn't work as well if you go into it when disease is still present, because it means you are more likely to relapse."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A horror movie that won’t end</strong></h2>



<p>The second round of chemo meant even more risk to Shannon’s chances of survival. "I got real sick in that second round," she says. "I ended up in ICU with a lung hemorrhage. I got so bad we made plans for a funeral. I mean, it was like a horror movie. I look back and I think, ‘Was all this a dream? Did I really go through that and make it out the other side?’"&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once Shannon recovered from the second round of chemo and the ensuing complications, a donor was sought for her stem cell transplant. Siblings are often ideal candidates because there is a higher chance of matching more of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens — there are over 100 different types of these special white blood cells, which are part of the genetic makeup in each person’s immune system. A higher match of these antigens makes for a better engraftment of the donated bone marrow. Fortunately for Shannon, testing reveled her brother Pat to be a perfect match.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Shannon_and_Dr._Shah_-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-380402" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Shannon_and_Dr._Shah_-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Shannon_and_Dr._Shah_-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Shannon_and_Dr._Shah_-1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Shannon_and_Dr._Shah_-1-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Shannon and Dr. Shah</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>For this phase of her treatment, Shannon came under the care of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shah-mithun-v-m-d-ph-d/bio-20436105">Mithun Shah, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a hematologist and consultant in Mayo’s Division of Hematology. A big fear for Dr. Shah was that Shannon might have recurrent bleeding in her lungs during the transplant procedure. To prepare for that possibility, he and his team had to make sure there was a source of donated blood ready if needed — and not just any blood, but HLA antibody platelets. "That makes it very difficult for us to just randomly select donors for these specific platelets," Dr. Shah says. "So, we had to talk to the transfusion team and make sure we had planned donors who would be ready to come in and donate on short notice."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August of 2018, Shannon underwent a stem cell transplant at Mayo Clinic. It was a complete success. "We had to use very minimal transfusion support, which is quite remarkable and very rarely seen in transplant," Dr. Shah says. "And then, post-transplant, her counts recovered well, and Shannon came through it like a champ."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A relapse doesn’t always mean "game over</strong>"</h2>



<p>Even so, about nine months after her transplant, Shannon relapsed. And this is where Mayo’s specialized FISH testing, again, helped inform and guide the next stage of her treatment.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>"WE DID A BONE MARROW BIOPSY, NOT EXPECTING ANY PROBLEMS TO BE THERE," DR. SHAH SAYS. "BUT THEN WHEN WE RAN A MORE SPECIALIZED FLUORESCENCE IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION TEST, WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THAT LEUKEMIA CELLS HAD COME BACK. AND THAT WAS A UNIQUE PART OF HER STORY BECAUSE, USUALLY, WE DON'T HAVE TO RUN FISH TESTS FOR LEUKEMIA PATIENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE ARE USUALLY IN THE CYTOGENETICS LAB, AND THAT’S WHERE WE STOP. BUT IN SHANNON’S CASE, WE WENT FOR THE FISH STUDY WHERE THEY FOUND RELAPSE SOLELY BASED ON THAT TEST, MEANING HER LEUKEMIA WAS COMING BACK AT A VERY, VERY LOW LEVEL. SO THAT AGAIN INFORMED OUR DECISION TO COME DOWN ON IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE MEDICATION."</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In accordance to the results of her testing, Shannon was put on targeted medication to address the leukemia cells that had returned to her body. After two years, however, she was able to discontinue the meds and has been in remission ever since. "I've been in remission for four years," she says. "My husband has been my rock through it all."</p>



<p>Both Shannon and Tim do not take lightly the role that the Genomics Lab and other labs at Mayo Clinic played in her treatment.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&nbsp;"THE PEOPLE DOING THE TESTING IN THE LABS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AT THE HEART OF MY CARE," SHE SAYS. "IT STARTS WITH THEM. WE WERE AMAZED BY THE WORK THEY DO, AND WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THE WORK THEY DO. THE DOCTORS GET ALL THE GLORY AND THE PAIN. BUT WE SAW FIRSTHAND THAT IT’S WHAT HAPPENS AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL THAT REALLY DRIVES THIS ORGANIZATION AND PATIENT CARE."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tim shares his wife’s appreciation for Mayo Clinic’s lab staff. "I’m a sixth-grade science teacher, and I was amazed by the amount of elementary, middle, and high school science that goes on inside a workplace like Mayo Clinic," he says. "And a theme that comes through in our narrative is those connections between the lab people, from a microscope and cellular level, on up to the doctors, and how that all works together. It’s changed how we look at medicine."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The lesser-known “cost” of long-term cancer treatment</strong></h2>



<p>In all, Shannon and Tim ended up shuttling from Wisconsin to Rochester for eight months to get through all her treatments and follow-ups. For five of those months, they needed to live on Mayo’s campus in downtown Rochester, but Shannon’s insurance didn’t cover the additional expense of housing. And because of her medical issues, she had to give up her beloved 28-year career as a schoolteacher (third and sixth grades). The financial strain caused additional stress they didn’t need during that time.</p>



<p>Because Shannon doesn’t want other cancer patients to have to go through the financial headaches and worries her family did over patient housing, she and a friend cofounded&nbsp;<a href="https://home4healing.org/#/">Home 4 Healing</a>, an organization that helps make housing more affordable and accessible for patients whose treatment necessitates extended stays near the Mayo Clinic campus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Dr. Gangat has been a key inspiration in helping me start Home 4 Healing," Shannon says. "She actually said to me, ‘We need this. We need to be able to offer people a place to go when we tell them they have to be here for long periods of time.’"</p>



<p>Shannon, meanwhile, remains under the care of Dr. Shah, who is optimistic about her future. "We try not to use the word ‘cure’ for leukemia," he says. "But every time I meet with Shannon, I tell her the chances of the leukemia coming back get smaller and smaller the longer she’s in remission. So, for all practical purposes, we hope, and we think, that she may be cured."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Candidate for robotic Whipple surgery</h3>



<p>The best candidate for the surgery depends on the person and the cancer.</p>



<p>"Typically, patients have a lower BMI and the pancreatic cancers that don't involve the main visceral vessels that passes through the pancreas," says Dr. Fong.</p>



<p>If you have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, your healthcare team will talk with you about treatment options. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">More about pancreatic cancer</h3>



<p>Pancreatic cancer usually doesn't show symptoms until it's advanced. </p>



<p>Treatment options for pancreatic cancer depend on the type, stage, and other factors and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or a combination of these.</p>

<p>Bile duct cancer, also known as cholangiocarcinoma, forms in the thin tubes that carry bile from your liver to your gallbladder and small intestine. Though relatively rare, cholangiocarcinoma is often diagnosed in later stages, making it more difficult to treat, and cases in the U.S. are increasing.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-023-00770-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review article</a>&nbsp;published in Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology in 2023, lead author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ilyas-sumera-i-m-b-b-s/bio-20258409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sumera I. Ilyas, M.B.B.S.</a>, and co-authors share advances in diagnosing, staging and treating bile duct cancer. Dr. Ilyas is a Mayo Clinic physician-scientist and a transplant hepatologist whose&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ilyas-sumera-i-m-b-b-s/bio-10031656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;focuses on the immunobiology of liver cancer. Here is a summary of their review:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The immune microenvironment of bile duct tumors promotes their growth.</h2>



<p>Dr. Ilyas says bile duct cancers have distinct tumor immune microenvironments (TIMEs). Researchers have begun to understand the complexity of these TIMEs and their relationship with the three different types of cholangiocarcinoma —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intrahepatic, hilar and distal</a>. The TIMEs of bile duct cancer have fewer cytotoxic cells — immune cells that help kill mutated and cancerous cells— and more cells that suppress the immune system. TIMEs may affect how the disease progresses and whether it can be treated with immunotherapy.</p>



<p>The genetic profile of different segments of bile duct tumors can also vary, known as heterogeneity. This makes it more challenging to target characteristics of the tumor for treatment.</p>



<p>Researchers are trying to understand how TIMEs help bile duct cancer grow and progress, evade the immune system and resist chemotherapy. Altering the TIME could make treatments more effective, &nbsp;including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune checkpoint inhibitors</a>&nbsp;and other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunotherapy</a>&nbsp;treatments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blood and bile samples may help diagnose bile duct cancer earlier.</h2>



<p>Diagnosing bile duct cancer early, when it's easier to treat, is a challenge. This is partly because cancer experts don't yet have the right tests and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/biomarker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biomarkers</a>&nbsp;to detect cholangiocarcinoma. "Efforts to identify better biomarkers to help diagnose the disease at an early stage and help gauge response to treatment are important," explains Dr. Ilyas. "Currently, there is a great deal of ongoing research focused on the use of tumor DNA in diagnosing and monitoring cholangiocarcinoma in patients receiving treatment."</p>



<p>Dr. Ilyas says research has identified potential biomarkers for cholangiocarcinoma. Researchers are now studying how biomarkers obtained through blood and bile samples from patients can help improve cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis. They are also looking for ways to detect and monitor tumors using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/liquid-biopsy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquid biopsies</a>, which use DNA that breaks away from the tumor to circulate in bodily fluids like blood or bile. "Although we anticipate that liquid biopsy may enhance early detection of cholangiocarcinoma, larger scale studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bile duct cancer treatments are improving.</h2>



<p>"Systemic treatment options for cholangiocarcinoma were once quite limited and not very effective," says Dr. Ilyas. Systemic therapies are drugs used to treat cancer, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted therapy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunotherapy</a>.</p>



<p>Targeted therapies are drugs targeting mutations that control how cancer cells grow, divide and spread. With a better understanding of the different genetic profiles of bile duct cancer subtypes, cancer experts are developing new treatments tailored to specific types of cholangiocarcinoma. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several new drugs that target specific genetic mutations associated with bile duct tumor growth. "The emergence of targeted therapies has broadened treatment options and, in doing so, given much more hope to our patients," says Dr. Ilyas.</p>



<p>Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system to attack cancer. While immunotherapy has not yet proven effective for treating cholangiocarcinoma, Dr. Ilyas says ongoing research to identify biomarkers and to understand why bile duct cancer doesn't respond to immunotherapy may improve outcomes.</p>



<p>Researchers are also studying liver transplants as a treatment option for cholangiocarcinoma in select patients with certain tumor types. However, Dr. Ilyas says this form of treatment needs further research.</p>

<p>He went through chemotherapy and stem cell transplants in the U.K., but his cancer was relentless. In 2021, after another failed treatment, John began looking for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20353386?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">options</a> in other countries.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ailawadhi-sikander-m-d/bio-20087330?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sikander Ailawadhi</a>, a hematologist and oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, kept coming up in his research. John took a chance and sent an email.</p>



<p>"Whatever it takes, if I have to come across the ocean, whenever they want me, I will do it," John says.</p>



<p>After crossing the Atlantic Ocean and meeting with a team at Mayo, John learned he was a candidate for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy</a>, or CAR-T. The personalized treatment collects a patient's T cells, which normally help fight off infections, and genetically engineers them to target cancer cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Florida became John's home for months as his cells were collected and prepared. In March 2022, his modified cells were infused back into his body. His cancer went into remission.</p>

<p>"Being able to go back to his life in that state of remission, spending time with his sons, thinking of going back to work if he wanted to, thinking of living his life — I think that was the No. 1 thing that it did for him," says Dr. Ailawadhi.</p>



<p>John spent months at home in remission, but his cancer was detected during a follow-up appointment. However, his story doesn't end there.</p>



<p>While John had been undergoing CAR-T and, later, in remission, new clinical trials became available in the U.K. He started care locally and is monitored closely by his Mayo team from Florida and London. John hopes to inspire others to keep searching for treatments and put up the best fight against their disease.</p>



<p>"I'm just looking to be happy," says John. "And basically, try and help somebody else. Because that gives me power to be able to see somebody benefit the way that I have."</p>

<p>January is Cervical Cancer Awareness Month. Each year, more than 11,000 new cases of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical cancer</a> are diagnosed in the U.S., according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/statistics/index.htm#:~:text=Each%20year%20in%20the%20United,women%20die%20of%20this%20cancer." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>



<p>Many women often don't show any signs of cervical cancer in the early stages of the disease. In advanced stages, symptoms may include vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or pain during intercourse.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/butler-kristina-a-m-d-m-s/bio-20110364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kristina Butler</a>, a Mayo Clinic gynecologic oncologist, explains why preventive screenings are crucial.</p>

<p>Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cells of the cervix. Women who have been exposed to HPV are most at risk. Routine Pap smears or HPV screenings can help detect precancerous cells.</p>



<p>"We recommend cervical cancer screening start at age 21 for most women and continue thereafter about every three to five years, depending on the type of screening that's performed. Annual pelvic exams are offered in the years a Pap smear is not due," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/01/cervical-cancer.jpg" alt="medical illustration of female organs and cervical cancer" class="wp-image-81881" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/01/cervical-cancer.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/01/cervical-cancer-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cervical cancer screening recommendations for older women</h3>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women receive a Pap smear until age 65.</p>



<p>"We do know that 16% of cervical cancers happen in women above the age of 65," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>She says it's important for women with high risk factors or postmenopausal women to continue regular screenings.</p>



<p>"Particularly if a woman has abnormal bleeding, or any bleeding after menopause, it's very relevant to be evaluated," explains Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>Practicing safe sex and getting the HPV vaccine can reduce your risk of cervical cancer. People can get vaccinated between the ages of 9 and 45.</p>

<p>There are several <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> subtypes. The growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer, the most common subtype, is driven by female hormones. Another common subtype, HER2-positive breast cancer, has excessive copies of a gene called HER2 that makes its cells grow more than they should.</p>



<p>Triple-negative breast cancer, also called basal-like breast cancer, is a subtype that isn't affected by hormones or the HER2 gene. It grows rapidly, is more likely to spread beyond the breast before diagnosis and is more likely to recur than other breast cancers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20340746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20340746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon Ferre, M.D</a>.</a>, a Mayo Clinic oncologist whose research focuses on triple-negative breast cancer, says recent advances are improving treatment outcomes for people with this disease. "This subtype represents about 15% of all breast cancers," says Dr. Leon Ferre.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>"It's a bit more common at younger ages and in African American women, Hispanic women and women of Indian descent. We also see this subtype more commonly in women who have a genetic mutation predisposing them to breast cancer — the BRCA1 mutation, in particular."</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">ROBERTO LEON FERRE, M.D.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre and other researchers at Mayo Clinic are working to understand how triple-negative breast cancer grows and spreads, how the immune system may recognize and fight it, and to develop new treatments for the disease. If you've been diagnosed with this breast cancer subtype, here’s what you should know:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is triple-negative breast cancer?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/roberto-leon-ferre-15303209-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379817" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/roberto-leon-ferre-15303209-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/roberto-leon-ferre-15303209.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Roberto Leon Ferre, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We do three tests on every breast cancer tumor to help us select treatment: The estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2. If those three tests are negative, the cancer is considered triple-negative breast cancer," says Dr. Leon Ferre.</p>



<p>Confirming a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer starts with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-biopsy/about/pac-20384812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biopsy</a>, a procedure to remove a sample of breast tissue for testing. Your care team will send your tissue to the laboratory for analysis to determine cell type, aggressiveness (grade) and whether the cancer cells have hormone receptors.</p>



<p>Hormone receptors are proteins that can attach to a specific hormone. Some breast cancer cells have receptors for the female hormone estrogen and need it to grow. These breast cancers can be treated with anti-estrogen hormone (endocrine) therapy to block their growth.</p>



<p>The lab will also analyze your cancer cells' genetic makeup to determine if they are HER2-positive or have other tumor markers. HER2-positive cancers have too many copies of the HER2 gene, which causes them to produce too much of the HER2 growth-promoting protein. These breast cancers can be treated with drugs that target the HER2 protein in cancer cells to slow those cells' growth and kill them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is triple-negative breast cancer treated?</h2>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre says that for some types of breast cancer, chemotherapy is used after surgery and sometimes not at all. This is not the case for triple-negative breast cancer. "The vast majority of women with this diagnosis will need chemotherapy, and we almost always treat with chemotherapy before surgery," he says.</p>



<p>With other breast cancers, chemotherapy is given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast.</p>



<p>"Triple-negative breast cancer tends to spread at a microscopic level from the beginning," says Dr. Leon Ferre. This means the cancer must be treated with&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2021/12/16/the-4-types-of-systemic-therapy-for-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">systemic therapy</a>&nbsp;— a drug or combination of drugs that can be taken orally or through an IV to reach cancer cells in all parts of the body. "The drugs usually used to avoid chemotherapy target estrogen receptors. This cancer doesn't have those, so we rely on chemotherapy, which essentially kills any cell that is dividing rapidly," he says.</p>



<p>Another systemic therapy used to treat triple-negative breast cancer is&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/11/29/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-immunotherapy-for-people-with-triple-negative-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunotherapy</a>, drugs that help your immune system identify and kill cancer cells. "At this time, it's the only type of breast cancer for which we use immunotherapy. Of all breast cancer subtypes, it's the one that's better able to alert the immune system to its presence. We can take advantage of that and use medications to activate the immune system further to attack the cancer," says Dr. Leon Ferre.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">ROBERTO LEON FERRE, M.D.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The immunotherapy approved for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer is called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/pembrolizumab-intravenous-route/description/drg-20122552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pembrolizumab</a>. It can be used with chemotherapy or other medicines before surgery and then continued alone after surgery to treat early stage, triple-negative breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. It can also treat triple-negative breast cancer that produces the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/pd-l1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PD-L1 protein</a>&nbsp;and cannot be surgically removed.</p>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic testing</a>&nbsp;can identify additional treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer. "There are some medications that work only in people that have certain genetic mutations, so it's important to ask for genetic testing — even if you don't have a family history of breast cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What should I ask my care team about triple-negative breast cancer?</h2>



<p>Before deciding on a treatment plan, Dr. Leon Ferre recommends asking your care team these questions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>What is the goal of my treatment?</strong><br>He says everyone diagnosed with cancer should ask their care team this question. "It's important to know if treatments are likely to cure the cancer or if treatment will be about controlling the cancer."</li>



<li><strong>Are clinical trials an option?<br></strong>If available treatments are unlikely to achieve a cure, consider clinical trials. "There have been many advances in triple-negative breast cancer research, and there are a lot of newer medications that work against this cancer," he says. Participating in a&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/05/23/is-a-cancer-clinical-trial-right-for-me/">clinical trial</a>&nbsp;may provide treatment options you may not otherwise have.</li>



<li><strong>Is immunotherapy an option?</strong><br>Immunotherapy can treat cancer by blocking immune checkpoints, the part of the immune system that prevents an immune response from being so strong that it destroys a body’s healthy cells. Dr. Leon Ferre says you should ask about immunotherapy if your care team doesn't mention it. Depending on the situation, you may need a test called PD-L1 to decide if immunotherapy would be a good option.</li>



<li><strong>What are the possible side effects of treatment?</strong><br>Before deciding on a treatment plan, it's crucial to understand the side effects of any treatment. "Understanding the potential side effects will help you anticipate how you will feel and prepare beforehand. Every cancer patient should ask about treatment side effects," he says.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are new treatments being developed for triple-negative breast cancer?</h2>



<p>Researchers are studying several new types of immunotherapy with the potential to treat triple-negative breast cancer. "These therapies are promising, and because they work differently than the immunotherapy now available, they are likely to help patients that do not qualify for that drug," says Dr. Leon Ferre. "We also have made progress in a class of drugs called antibody-drug conjugates. These treatments link a small amount of chemotherapy to modified antibodies — naturally occurring proteins that help fight infections. The antibodies have been modified to recognize specific portions of the tumor, instead of bacteria or viruses, and are attached to a small dose of chemotherapy. This allows chemotherapy delivery to tumor cells while sparing cells that aren’t cancerous. These drugs seem to be more potent than traditional chemotherapy."</p>



<p>Researchers have also made advances in the development of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted therapies</a>&nbsp;for triple-negative breast cancer. These drugs target proteins that control how cancer cells grow, divide and spread. "These treatments are for patients with certain genetic mutations — some targeted therapies specifically block those mutations," says Dr. Leon Ferre. "Some of these drugs are oral and have fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy. So, we may be able to treat some patients with targeted-drug therapies and perhaps have phases of treatment where they don't need chemotherapy. These drugs can be much better tolerated and usually don't cause nausea or hair loss."</p>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre and his colleagues at Mayo Clinic are conducting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/search-results?keyword=triple-negative%20breast%20cancer&amp;studySiteStatusesGrouped=Open%2FStatus%20Unknown#0c1d955fe5494ae68c25c6f1aad733c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trials</a>&nbsp;of targeted therapies for triple-negative breast cancer. "We're working on ways to identify patients that may do well with less or no chemotherapy. We're finding immune markers that may allow us to identify patients with early stage cancer with such a good prognosis that they may need less intensive chemotherapy."</p>

<p>If you've been diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, Dr. Leon Ferre wants you to know that it's treatable. "It's very sensitive to chemotherapy. With the incorporation of immunotherapy and some newer drugs, we're seeing higher cure rates for patients with early stage breast cancer. And we have new treatments for patients with metastatic breast cancer. We're making a lot of progress."</p>

<p>Every year, thousands are diagnosed with the disease. Many are given little time to live. The prognosis is often poorer for older patients.</p>



<p>Researchers are searching for a cure. Meanwhile a team at Mayo Clinic is also looking for ways to help elderly patients diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-is-glioblastoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a> live longer and maintain quality of life. </p>



<p>Now, an investigational study at Mayo Clinic using an innovative approach to treatment has shown promise in improving health outcomes for people like Richard Casper.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Love at first sight</h2>



<p>Richard and Carol Casper were in their early 20s when they met. Carol was smitten, but not sure Richard would call her again.</p>



<p>"So, anyway, he did," recalls Carol with a twinkle in her eye. "That's where it all started in 1962, and we got married in 1964." </p>



<p>Children soon followed, and their family began traveling the world with Richard's career in the U.S. Air Force.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-802x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378587" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-802x1024.png 802w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-235x300.png 235w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-768x981.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM.png 844w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Richard and Carol on their wedding day in 1964</strong>                                                                                                                                                 Photo courtesy: Casper family</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The day their world changed&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After nearly 30 years of military service, the couple was looking forward to retirement. Then suddenly, in 2019, Richard suffered a seizure and their world came crashing down. Testing began to identify the cause of his seizures. </p>



<p>Ultimately surgery confirmed the family's worst fear - brain cancer.</p>



<p>"That's when we got the definite diagnosis that it was <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-is-glioblastoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma, stage 4,</a>" says Carol. Doctors told the family Richard had less than a year to live.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We were hit with a bomb."</p><cite>Carol Casper, Richard's wife</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Glioblastoma: The deadliest form of brain cancer&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Glioblastoma is one of the most complex and fast-growing forms of brain cancer. It is also the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, though it can strike at any age. It can form in the spinal cord or the brain.</p>



<p>"It carries the worst prognosis, and it has to do with the aggressiveness of the cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist with Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona. "Despite our best treatments, we see patients continue to recur, which requires additional treatments over time." &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://braintumor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Brain Tumor Society</a>, more than 14,490 Americans are expected to be diagnosed in 2023. They estimate approximately 10,000 will die from the disease.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research to improve patient outcomes</h2>



<p>Dr. Vora has been researching brain tumors and ways to improve patient outcomes for the past two decades. His team is now investigating an innovative treatment protocol for elderly patients, like Richard, who are often given less time than average to live. </p>



<p>"Most of these patients are in the six- to nine-month range," says Dr. Vora. "We're looking for ways of providing more effective and better treatments for patients in terms of both quality and quantity of life."</p>



<p>Richard sought treatment at Mayo Clinic in Arizona under the care of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-alyx-b-m-d/bio-20055164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alyx Porter, M.D</a>., a neuro-oncologist. "When people come in, it is one of the scariest times in their life," says Dr. Porter. "My job is to provide them with comfort, reassurance and direction as to what the next steps will be."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic's multidisciplinary approach</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic's healthcare model is based on a team approach. Physicians from a variety of disciplines work together to explore the best treatment options for a patient and deliver the highest level of care.</p>



<p>Richard's family was aware there was likely no cure. What&nbsp;they wanted was more time than his prognosis.&nbsp;His healthcare team agreed Richard was an ideal candidate for the clinical trial. Richard told doctors he was ready to be a participant.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Sign me up. I just need to get my balance back, and I think I'll be able to roll with the punch."&nbsp;</p><cite>Richard Casper </cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Targeting cancer cells with advanced medical imaging</h2>



<p>Radiation and chemotherapy are often used to try and slow progression of the cancer. The study is investigating an innovative approach researchers hope will help elderly glioblastoma patients live longer with fewer symptoms of the cancer and side effects from treatment.</p>



<p>It incorporates the use of an advanced medical imaging technique, called 18F-DOPA PET and MRI to target specific areas of the brain for treatment and spare healthy tissue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="557" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1024x557.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378592" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1024x557.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-300x163.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-768x418.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1536x836.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-2048x1114.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Dr. Vora showing how 18F-DOPA PET/MRI is being studied as a way to help improve treatment of glioblastoma</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"18F-DOPA is more or less a special type of sugar that cancer cells take at a faster rate compared to healthy cells that is very specific for glioblastoma. So, with this PET scan, we can actually now identify areas in the brain that are felt to be at highest risk for tumor growth," says Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>The other critical part of this regimen is that it's much more convenient for patients. "Instead of the traditional three to six weeks' worth of radiation, we're able to complete their entire treatment in one to two weeks, which allows more time for patients to stay with their family," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p>The areas are then targeted with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-proton-beam-therapy-bolsters-cancer-treatment/">proton beam therapy</a> to destroy cancer cells. Proton beam therapy is innovative technology that can painlessly deliver higher doses of radiation, in a shorter amount of time, with fewer side effects. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="566" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1024x566.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378595" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1024x566.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-300x166.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-768x424.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1536x849.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-2048x1131.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Proton beam therapy delivers higher doses of radiation in shorter amounts of time often with fewer side effects</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I felt great," says Richard after completing his treatment. "I wouldn't even know I have a brain tumor right now if someone didn't tell me so." </p>



<p>Dr. Porter credits the study's treatment protocol. "With the shorter course of treatment, it saved him from many of the side effects that we know can be as devastating as the disease itself. He was able to finish the treatment, unscathed, walking and dancing into my office thrilled at how good he actually felt."&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Richard beats the odds&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Richard survived almost twice longer than his original prognosis while maintaining his quality of life. "My dad defied the odds and kept going," says Susan, Richard's daughter. "To be almost 2 ½ years in after being told you only have a few months left to live, is quite remarkable."</p>

<p>The Casper family says they're proud of Richard's courage to help in the fight against cancer. "What he went through, and even during the trial, made a big difference in helping other people," says Carol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Richard maintained his valiant battle till the end. He died on March 8, 2023.&nbsp;"All of us at Mayo feel very fortunate to have known Mr. Casper," says Dr. Vora. "He was a very special person."</p>



<p>Dr. Vora presented results of the trial at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology. </p>



<p>"The results are quite promising," says Dr. Vora. "We're hoping to see these results carried on in a larger-scale study. If we continue to see the same types of results, we feel it could be a good option moving forward for all cancer patients."&nbsp;</p>

<p>January is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nccc-online.org/cervical-health-awareness-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cervical Health Awareness Month</a>, which makes this a good time to&nbsp;learn about the connection between HPV and cervical cancer.</p>



<p>Approximately 13,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S., and 4,000 women die of the disease, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Hispanic women have the highest rates of developing cervical cancer, while African American women are at greatest risk of dying from this cancer.</p>



<p>Early-stage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical cancer</a>&nbsp;generally produces no signs or symptoms. Indications of more advanced cervical cancer include vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between periods or after menopause; watery, bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor; and pelvic pain or pain during intercourse.</p>



<p>Various strains of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV</a>, a viral infection, play a role in causing most cervical cancer. When people are exposed to genital HPV, their immune systems usually prevent the virus from doing serious harm. But sometimes the virus survives for years. Eventually, the&nbsp;virus can convert normal cells on the surface of the cervix into cancerous cells. Cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an&nbsp;HPV&nbsp;infection.</p>



<p>Gardasil 9 is an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/in-depth/hpv-vaccine/art-20047292?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV&nbsp;vaccine</a>&nbsp;approved by the Food and Drug Administration for males and females 9 to 45. This vaccine can prevent most cases of cervical cancer if a girl or woman is vaccinated before being exposed to the virus. In addition, this vaccine can prevent vaginal and vulvar cancer in women, as well as genital warts; anal cancer; and mouth, throat, head and neck cancers&nbsp;in men and women.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352506?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment</a>&nbsp;for cervical cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, other health problems you may have and your personal preferences. Treatment may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy, immunotherapy and palliative care.</p>
