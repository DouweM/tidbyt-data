<p>LA CROSSE, Wis. ― The warm summer weather can make adults feel like kids again. The Weekend Warrior comes roaring out, and the excitement and bursts of exertion can lead to a very common injury among that group: Achilles tendinitis.</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/achilles-tendinitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Achilles tendinitis</a> is most common in people who suddenly increase the intensity or duration of exercise. It's also common when someone hasn't been properly trained for their sport," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jacob-erickson-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Erickson, D.O., Sports Medicine</a>, Mayo Clinic Health System.</p>



<p>The Achilles tendon is a long band of tissue that connects calf muscles at the back of the lower leg to your heel bone. This tendon is used when walking, running, jumping or pushing up on your toes. But if it's injured, the pain, typically located in the back of your calf, and lack of function can throw you off your stride for months.</p>



<p>Recognizing when you're at risk for Achilles tendinitis and knowing how to prevent it can keep you walking, running and exercising without pain. Risk factors include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Your sex</strong><br>Achilles tendinitis is most common in men.</li>



<li><strong>Age</strong><br>You're at a higher risk as you get older.</li>



<li><strong>Flat feet</strong><br>A naturally flat arch in your foot can put more strain on the Achilles tendon.</li>



<li><strong>Obesity</strong><br>Carrying extra pounds also increases tendon strain.</li>



<li><strong>Poor footwear</strong><br>Running in worn-out shoes or wearing footwear inappropriate for your sport can injure the tendon.</li>



<li><strong>Weather and terrain</strong><br>Tendon pain occurs more frequently in cold weather than when it's warm out. Running on hills also can put more stress on your Achilles tendon.</li>



<li><strong>Medical conditions and medications</strong><br>People with psoriasis, high blood pressure or who take certain types of antibiotics, called fluoroquinolones, are at higher risk of developing Achilles tendinitis.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Although you may be at risk for this type of injury, there are things you can do to help prevent it," says Dr. Erickson. "For example, if you're beginning an exercise regimen, start slowly and gradually increase the duration and intensity of the training."</p>



<p>Other tips include avoiding activities that place excessive stress on your tendons, such as hill running. If you participate in a strenuous activity, warm up first by exercising at a slower pace. If you notice pain during a particular exercise, stop and rest.</p>



<p>Choose your shoes carefully. The shoes you wear while exercising should provide adequate heel cushioning and firm arch support to help reduce the tension in the Achilles tendon. Replace your worn-out shoes. If your shoes are in good condition but don't support your arch, try adding supports in both shoes.</p>



<p>Take the time to stretch your calf muscles and Achilles tendon in the morning, before exercise and after exercise to maintain flexibility. This is especially important to avoid a recurrence of Achilles tendinitis.</p>



<p>Strengthen your calf muscles. Strong calf muscles enable the calf and Achilles tendon to handle activity and exercise stress better.</p>



<p>"If you do experience an Achilles injury, be sure to rest and avoid exercising the area," says Dr. Erickson. "Recognizing the pain early and avoiding exercising through the pain is key. Ignoring the pain and continuing to exercise can cause the problem to snowball and become chronic. Early recognition, resting and basic stretching can remedy the problem quickly."</p>



<p>If you are unable to get the problem to calm down after a few weeks, it is time to contact your healthcare team. Early medical treatment includes more intensive physical therapy exercises and sometimes topical treatment to assist with the pain.</p>



<p>Achilles tendinitis can become chronic and last for many months or even years if not appropriately treated early. Refractory cases of Achilles tendon pain may require surgery to repair the tendon. Healing can take months, so it's best to be aware of your risks and practice preventive strategies to keep you active and pain-free.</p>

<p>LA CROSSE, Wis. ― With summer temperatures soaring, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/healthy-pregnancy/hlv-20049471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pregnant women</a> need to be extra cautious to avoid heat-related health issues. The body's natural cooling mechanisms are already working overtime during pregnancy, making it more difficult to regulate temperature.</p>



<p><strong>The challenge of staying cool during pregnancy</strong></p>



<p>"Pregnancy makes it more difficult to keep our body temperature down," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/abbey-rose-cnm-apnp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abbey Rose</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/tomah/services-and-treatments/obstetrics-and-gynecology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certified nurse midwife</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Tomah</a>. "Our bodies have to work harder to keep us cool because we're not only cooling ourselves but also our babies. This means that pregnant women are more susceptible to heat exhaustion and heat stroke compared to nonpregnant individuals."</p>



<p>Heat can be particularly dangerous during pregnancy because an elevated core body temperature can lead to serious complications.</p>



<p>"You don't want your core body temperature to exceed 102 degrees," warns Rose. "This can lead to heat stroke or heat exhaustion, which are both dangerous for both mother and baby."</p>



<p><strong>Hydration: The key to staying cool</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Staying hydrated</a> is one of the most important steps pregnant women can take to protect themselves in the heat.</p>



<p>"Water is always preferred," says Rose. "But fluids with electrolytes are also beneficial because we lose sodium and potassium through sweat. It's important to replace these, especially on hot summer days."</p>



<p>However, not all drinks are created equal. "Avoid caffeinated beverages like coffee, soda and certain teas, as they can dehydrate you," Rose advises. "Sports drinks and other sugary drinks shouldn't replace water. Pure water is the best and healthiest option."</p>



<p>Rose recommends pregnant women drink at least 64 ounces of water daily and increase that amount if spending time in hot weather.</p>



<p>"Your hydration needs to increase when you’re pregnant, especially in the heat," says Rose. "It's essential to stay ahead of your thirst. If you're thirsty, you're already behind on your hydration."</p>



<p><strong>Practical tips for staying cool</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dress for the heat</strong>: Wear loose, breathable fabrics, such as cotton or moisture-wicking clothes, to stay cool. Avoid tight items that can trap heat and cause discomfort.</li>



<li><strong>Seek shade</strong>: When planning outdoor activities, always look for shaded areas. "Try to stay under shade trees, near water or use a splash pad to keep cool," suggests Rose. "If you're going to a park, sit under a tree. If you're near water, keep your feet in it to help lower your body temperature."</li>



<li><strong>Recognize the signs of overheating</strong>: Pregnant women should be vigilant about the signs of overheating, which include increased sweating, dizziness, fatigue, unquenchable thirst and muscle cramps. "If you experience these symptoms, get out of the sun, hydrate and use cool cloths on your neck, armpits and groin to lower your body temperature," says Rose.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Understanding heat exhaustion and heat stroke</strong></p>



<p>It's crucial to understand the symptoms and risks of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heat-exhaustion/symptoms-causes/syc-20373250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heat exhaustion</a> symptoms include headache, dizziness, confusion, loss of appetite, nausea, extreme thirst and muscle cramps.</p>



<p>"If you experience these signs, move to a cool area," Rose explains. "Place cool washcloths or towels on your head, neck, armpits and groin. Hydrate, and you should start feeling better within 30 minutes."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heat-stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20353581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heat stroke</a>, a more severe condition, includes symptoms such as not sweating despite feeling hot, high body temperature, shortness of breath, confusion, rapid breathing and seizures.</p>



<p>"These symptoms require immediate medical attention," Rose stresses. "Heat stroke can be life-threatening for both the mother and the baby."</p>



<p><strong>Additional precautions</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Plan ahead</strong>: Always have an action plan for outdoor activities. "Pack extra water, ice packs, and have current medications handy," Rose advises. "Be aware of the heat index and air quality, especially if traveling. Be prepared to find air conditioning or a shady tree if you start to feel overheated."</li>



<li><strong>Use technology</strong>: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a Heat &amp; Health Tracker app, which provides information on heat risk and air quality. "This can be a valuable tool for planning your day," says Rose. "You can input your zip code and get real-time updates on the heat index and air quality."</li>
</ul>



<p>Rose also highlights the importance of recognizing when professional medical help is needed.</p>



<p>"If you haven't urinated in over 24 hours, or if you're experiencing frequent uterine cramps, contact your obstetrics department," she advises. "I've seen many cases where women underestimated the heat and ended up with serious complications. Many didn't realize how much fluid they need until they start feeling dizzy and experiencing cramps. Patients then come to the clinic needing IV fluids to rehydrate."</p>



<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>



<p>"Pregnancy is a time of great care and precaution," Rose concludes. "The summer heat adds an extra layer of complexity, but with the right precautions and awareness, expectant mothers can enjoy the season safely. Always prioritize hydration, wear the right clothing, seek shade and be vigilant about the signs of overheating. Your health and your baby's health depend on it."</p>

<p>About 1 in 8 men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Many of those patients undergo surgery to get rid of the cancerous tumor.</p>

<p>"Most of the time, prostate cancer is a slower-growing type of tumor," says Dr. Tollefson. "Physically removing it could then cure one from cancer."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Advancements in robotic prostate surgery</h3>



<p>He says surgery is a common option for many men, especially if the cancer is contained in the prostate. Medical innovation has improved cancer removal surgeries. Now, there's an upgrade to the robotic prostatectomy procedure.</p>



<p>"Instead of all of the instruments coming in through separate incisions, they come in through a single incision, and the robot is able to then branch out within the abdomen and remove the prostate," explains Dr. Tollefson.</p>



<p>Patients have a faster recovery and reduced pain with the single-port robotic procedure.</p>



<p>Other prostate cancer treatment options can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Radiation therapy.</li>



<li>Ablative therapies.</li>



<li>Hormone therapy.</li>



<li>Chemotherapy.</li>



<li>Immunotherapy.</li>



<li>Targeted drug therapy.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/sexual-health/in-depth/testosterone-therapy/art-20045728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Testosterone</a> is a key male hormone that is responsible for characteristics like hair growth, muscle mass and deepening of the voice. As men age, testosterone levels gradually decline, particularly over 40.</p>



<p>"The main complaint I see as a urologist is a lack of interest in sexual functioning," says Dr. Broderick. "But fatigue, changes in mental acuity, less stamina and very often mild degrees of depression are associated with falling testosterone."</p>



<p>In some cases, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/testosterone-topical-application-route/description/drg-20073444?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infertility</a> can be tied to low testosterone. But presenting these symptoms or traits is not an automatic diagnosis.</p>



<p>"Not all men need testosterone," says Dr. Broderick. "It's very important that this diagnosis is properly made based on symptoms but also the serum level of testosterone in the blood."</p>



<p>When it comes to treating low testosterone, the most common way is a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/testosterone-topical-application-route/description/drg-20073444?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cream</a> applied to the upper arm, but <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/testosterone-intramuscular-route-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20095183?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">injectable</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/testosterone-oral-route/proper-use/drg-20461351?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pill</a> forms of testosterone are also available.</p>



<p>"Each of those avenues is designed to get you back to a normal level of testosterone," says Dr. Broderick. "What you should notice is that within 48 to 72 hours of your dosage that your desire has improved."</p>

<p>"I like to tell patients that the prostate is kind of like an orange with a straw going right through the middle of it. And as we age, the prostate gets larger and larger. And the straw going through the middle gets compressed by the tissue of the prostate, makes it harder for the bladder to push urine through the urethra," says Dr. Cheney.</p>



<p>Enlarged prostate symptoms can include frequent or urgent urination, a weak urine stream and the inability to empty your bladder.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389164" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Prostate-16-x-9-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>"I see men who get up at night to pee, and they get up again and again. They get poor sleep, It can really affect their lifestyle. So they're always looking for a restroom wherever they go, they can't drive long distances because they have to stop and urinate very frequently," says Dr. Cheney.</p>



<p>If you suffer from any of those symptoms, Dr. Cheney first recommends a few lifestyle modifications.</p>



<p>"You can tell a man to avoid excess fluids. Some men, they don't realize how much fluid they're drinking. The more fluid you drink, the more often you're going to have to urinate. The types of fluids also matter. So, if a man is drinking a lot of caffeine, a lot of alcohol, especially before bed, that can cause nighttime issues with urination," Dr. Cheney says.</p>



<p>He says talk to your healthcare team about your concerns. An enlarged prostate also can be treated effectively with medications or procedures.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-benefits-of-an-active-workstation/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: Benefits of an active workstation</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic research shows that using an active workstation can help you move more and think better at work — without affecting your job. Sitting too much at work or home can increase your risk of certain diseases. Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez,&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, says using active workstations boosts brain power and can cut down on sitting time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-link-between-heart-disease-and-stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: The link between heart disease and stroke</a></h2>



<p>Every 34 seconds, a person in the U.S. dies from a cardiovascular disease, according to the American Heart Association. Together, heart disease and stroke account for more than 58% of cardiovascular disease deaths. Dr. Stephen English, a Mayo Clinic&nbsp;neurologist, says&nbsp;atrial fibrillation, a type of heart disease causing an abnormal heart rhythm, contributes to nearly 20% of stroke cases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-types-of-brain-tumors-and-treatments/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Types of brain tumors and treatments</a></h2>



<p>A brain tumor can significantly affect a person's quality of life, not just length of life. There are different types of brain tumors and ways to treat them that a healthcare team may consider. Dr. Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa says treatment can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-testing-gait-to-help-in-early-diagnosis-of-neurodegenerative-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: Testing gait to help in early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease</a></h2>



<p>How does your gait — or how you walk — relate to your brain health? Considerably, says Dr. Farwa Ali, a Mayo Clinic neurologist who specializes in movement disorders. The hope is that early diagnosis of gait and balance problems will lead to better treatment and outcomes for patients with degenerative brain disorders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-this-bright-red-birthmark-on-my-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: What is this bright red birthmark on my baby?</a></h2>



<p>A hemangioma, also known as a strawberry birthmark, is a bright red birthmark that appears in the first or second week of life. Although technically tumors, parents shouldn't let that name or their stark appearance worry them. Dr. Megha Tollefson, a Mayo Clinic pediatric dermatologist, explains what caregivers should know if their child has a hemangioma.</p>

<p>It's a long-standing discussion for all who want to get into shape. When is the best time to exercise? According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.future.co/blog/the-most-popular-workout-times-according-to-future-member-data--T8IWv05y4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future Member</a>, about&nbsp;41%&nbsp;of workouts take place between 7–9 AM or 5–7 PM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The debate is intriguing with proponents of both morning and evening workouts citing various benefits," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/andrew-jagim-phd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Jagim, M.D</a>., director of sports medicine research at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/orthopedic-surgery/sports-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Onalaska</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Morning workouts</h2>

<p>For morning exercisers, the allure of starting the day with a workout is undeniable.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>"Getting your workout in and completed before you even begin your day can provide a sense of accomplishment and set a positive tone for the day ahead," explains Dr. Jagim. "The post-workout release of endorphins and the satisfaction of accomplishing something before 9 a.m. can serve as a powerful ego boost."</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, morning workouts eliminate the need to worry about finding time for exercise later in the day because&nbsp;it's often the only time of the day that hasn't been previously committed to work, social events or family activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"By completing your workout in the morning, you free up your afternoons and evenings for other activities, such as cooking dinner, socializing or simply relaxing," Dr. Jagim notes. "This sense of freedom and flexibility can alleviate stress and enhance overall well-being."</p>



<p>For people embarking on morning workouts, strategic pre-exercise nutrition can make a significant difference in energy levels and performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Starting the day with a balanced breakfast containing carbohydrates, protein and healthy fats can provide the necessary energy to power through a morning workout," Dr. Jagim advises. "Opt for whole-grain cereals, Greek yogurt with fruit, and allow sufficient time for digestion to prevent discomfort and optimize nutrient absorption. Or, if you’re not hungry in the mornings or don’t have time, something simple like an energy bar can suffice."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Evening workouts</h2>



<p>However, for some people, waking up early to exercise is the last thing they feel like doing, and, therefore, the case for evening workouts is more appealing.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="407" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/07/a-middle-aged-Black-woman-outside-smiling-while-exercising-walking-and-carrying-hand-weights-16x9-1.jpg" alt="a middle aged Black woman outside, smiling while exercising, walking and carrying hand weights, workout" class="wp-image-311569" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/07/a-middle-aged-Black-woman-outside-smiling-while-exercising-walking-and-carrying-hand-weights-16x9-1.jpg 724w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/07/a-middle-aged-Black-woman-outside-smiling-while-exercising-walking-and-carrying-hand-weights-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure></div>


<p>"Your body's ability to perform peaks in the afternoon and early evening, with optimal muscle function, strength and endurance," states&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jacob-erickson-do">Jake Erickson, D.O</a>.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/orthopedic-surgery/sports-medicine">sports medicine</a>, Mayo Clinic Health System in Onalaska. "During this time, your body has time to wake up a bit by moving around throughout the day, you've likely gotten a meal or two in to ensure adequate energy available to use during the workout, and you may be more mentally alert."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, oxygen uptake kinetics are more favorable in the evening, allowing for more efficient utilization of resources during exercise. "Your body is primed for performance in the late afternoon and early evening, making it an ideal window for high-intensity activities like interval training or speed work," Dr. Erickson explains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversely, people opting for evening workouts face unique considerations in balancing time commitments and mental energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"After a long day at work or shuttling around the kids all day, it can be hard to muster the motivation to go to the gym and put forth a lot of physical effort during a workout," adds&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/alecia-gende-do">Alecia Gende, D.O.</a>, sports medicine and emergency physician at Mayo Clinic Health System in Onalaska. "Additionally, intense physical activity in the evening may trigger a stress response and cause difficulty falling asleep or waking in the middle of the night if your cortisol is disrupted and released at an inopportune time. If you have to get a workout in before sleep it would be best to be lower intensity such as a walk or lighter lifting session. If that's the case moving the workout earlier in the day might be more beneficial for them."</p>



<p>Lastly, if you choose to work out later in the day, it's important to ensure you are getting adequate nutrients throughout the day to make sure you have enough fuel available to support the workout, in addition to eating a well-balanced meal after the workout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"After a long day, it's essential to refuel the body with carbohydrates and protein," Dr. Jagim suggests. "Consuming a nutrient-rich meal within two hours of your workout can facilitate muscle recovery and enhance adaptation to training. Consider options such as grilled chicken with quinoa and vegetables, or a protein-packed stir-fry to refuel and replenish after an evening workout."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What about a midday workout</h2>



<p>Whether working or at home, most people hit the dreaded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/how-to-wake-yourself-up">afternoon slump</a>&nbsp;around 3 p.m.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36546-5">A study of more than 90,000 people</a>&nbsp;recently found working out in the afternoon reduces the risk of heart disease or early death more than physical activity in either the morning or afternoon.&nbsp;The benefits of afternoon exercise for longevity were most pronounced for men and the elderly.</p>



<p>"Morning workouts may not be ideal for shift workers or those working late or staying up later in the evening," says Dr. Gende. "In that case, it may be more prudent to allow more sleep in the morning and perform a mid-day workout or early afternoon workout before your next evening shift or late night."&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a OnePoll survey, the most effective activity for people for an afternoon workout is getting up and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/fitness-exercise/walking-benefits">going for a walk</a>, which is a great way to perk up both your mind and body.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid just staying on the couch</h2>



<p>For those who just say I don't have any time available, there's always time.</p>



<p>"I suggest scheduling a “snack competing” activity," says Dr. Erickson. "This can be a good excuse to flip the script and for people who know they may choose to sit on the couch and snack in the evenings. They can use that time to grab a workout of some kind instead. This can lead to a big swing in people’s fitness as they consume less calories by avoiding the typical snacking time and burn more calories by the workout."</p>



<p>For people engaging in prolonged or intense exercise sessions (more than 90 minutes), mid-workout nutrition can play a pivotal role in sustaining energy levels and preventing fatigue. Dr. Jagim recommends incorporating carbohydrate-rich snacks during extended workouts to maintain endurance and performance.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding the optimal balance</h2>



<p>So, what is the best time to exercise? There are even benefits to splitting up a workout into short 10-minute mini-sessions throughout the day if you don't have time to get a full 60-minute session in.</p>



<p>One thing is clear; even though science may seem contradictory, the importance of regular physical activity cannot be overstated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Ultimately, the best time to exercise is the time that fits into your schedule and aligns with your energy levels and preferences," concludes Dr. Jagim. "Consistency and adherence to a regular exercise routine are key and far more important regardless of the time of day you choose to work out. Any time of day is better than no exercise in reducing the risk of death from any cause, heart disease, and cancer. Experimentation and self-awareness are essential in determining the ideal timing toward optimizing exercise performance, recovery and overall well-being."&nbsp;</p>
