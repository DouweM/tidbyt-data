<p>In this season of packing up for college, here's a warning about packing on the "freshman 15." </p>



<p>"It's usually not actually 15 (pounds). It's more often 7 or 8," says Dr. Millstone.</p>



<p>Still, it's extra weight that Dr. Millstine says is often caused by a change in activity and eating habits from high school to college.  </p>



<p>"If you're going to be eating at a cafeteria or eating out more, stop and think: How am I going to manage this?" she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Millstine offers four daily goals for every freshman. No. 1: Eat plants. </p>



<p>"Ideally, at least five fruits and vegetables every day," says Dr. Millstine. </p>



<p>No. 2: Don't drink a lot of calories. </p>



<p>"If you're going to class and you're grabbing a coffee drink or a smoothie, it can have a lot of calories in it," explains Dr. Millstine. "Same thing with energy drinks." </p>



<p>No. 3: Find ways to move.  </p>



<p>"Take the stairs instead of the elevator," she explains. "Always make sure you're walking to class."</p>



<p>And No. 4: Get decent sleep. </p>



<p>"Really trying to get that seven to nine hours of sleep consistently, whatever your body requires, can help you to manage your weight." Dr. Millstine concludes.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My kids and I love to go hiking when the weather is nice, but I've heard ticks are terrible this year. What are the risks? How can I keep us safe and still stay active outside?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Warm weather entices you into the great outdoors. But while you're having fun golfing, camping, picnicking and hiking, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alpha-gal-syndrome/in-depth/tick-species/art-20546861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ticks</a> are looking for a ride — and a meal. Ticks live in woods, fields and grassy areas. All of them survive on blood drawn from people or animals, and they can pass along disease in the process.</p>



<p>To find their next meal, ticks climb onto objects like blades of grass, leaves or shrubs and stick out their legs. When a host brushes by, they grab on. Some ticks attach quickly, while others wander, looking for places where the skin is thinner, like the ear. Ticks also like warm and dark areas, such as the armpit, behind the knee, along the scalp and in the belly button. That's where they'll grab hold and bite.</p>



<p>While attached to a host, ticks can acquire or pass along disease. After feeding, most drop off. At their next feeding, ticks can transmit an acquired disease to the new host.</p>



<p>Ticks are found in most regions of the country. Tick-borne diseases and regions in the U.S. they're common include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lyme disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ehrlichiosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anaplasmosis</a>, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/babesiosis-and-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-2023-tick-season/">babesiosis</a> and Borrelia miyamotoi disease: Upper Midwest and the Northeast</li>



<li>Ehrlichiosis: Southeast and South Central</li>



<li>Rocky Mountain spotted fever: North Carolina, South Central and Southwest</li>



<li>Relapsing fever: Great Plains, Mountain West and West Coast</li>



<li>Southern tick-associated rash illness, or Lone Star tick disease: East, Southeast and South Central, but spreading north</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Not every tick carries disease, but it's still a good idea to avoid being bitten. These tips can help:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When outdoor activities take you into tick territory, wear shoes (not sandals), long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, hat and gloves.</li>



<li>Stick to trails when possible, and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass.</li>



<li>Keep dogs leashed so they don't venture where ticks may be.</li>



<li>Use insect repellents with at least 20% DEET. Repellents with up to 30% DEET can be applied to children over 2 months old but used sparingly on children under 2. Apply to clothes and exposed skin but not hands.</li>
</ul>



<p>The concentration of DEET in a repellent determines how long protection lasts. A concentration of 10% provides two hours of protection; 30% gives five hours. Avoid products that combine sunscreen and DEET because <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/sunscreen-agent-topical-application-route/proper-use/drg-20070255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunscreen</a> needs to be applied more frequently than DEET.</p>



<p>After spending time in a wooded or grassy area, check yourself, as well as your children and pets, for ticks. Deer ticks, which carry Lyme disease, often are no bigger than the head of a pin, so search carefully.</p>



<p>Shower as soon as you come indoors. Using a washcloth on your skin can dislodge ticks that haven't attached yet. You also can put your clothes in the dryer for 10 minutes on high heat to kill lingering ticks.</p>



<p>If a tick has attached, time is key. The longer it hangs on, the greater your risk of getting tick-borne diseases.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To remove a tick:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Avoid folklore remedies like painting the tick with nail polish or petroleum jelly, or using heat from a match or lighter to release its hold.</li>



<li>Use fine-tipped tweezers to grab the tick firmly near its head or mouth and as close to the skin as possible.</li>



<li>Pull the tick's body up and away from your skin. Avoid jerking or twisting.</li>



<li>Take a photo of the tick so your healthcare professional can identify it. Dispose of the tick by putting it in alcohol or a sealed bag, wrapping it tightly in tape or flushing it down the toilet.</li>



<li>After handling the tick, use soap and water to wash your hands and the area around the tick bite.</li>
</ul>



<p>A small, red bump often appears at the site of a tick bite and resolves after a few days. This is typical and doesn't indicate that it has transmitted a disease to that person.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Contact your healthcare professional if:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>You aren't able to completely remove the tick.</strong></li>



<li><strong>The rash or bump gets bigger.</strong></li>



<li><strong>You develop flu-like signs and symptoms.</strong></li>



<li><strong>You think the bite site is infected.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Don't let worry over tick-borne diseases keep you and your family indoors. You can safely enjoy your favorite summer activities with a few precautions, like carefully checking for and removing ticks after spending time in wooded or grassy areas. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/katie-clubb-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Katie Clubb, M.D.</em></a><em><strong>, Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, </strong></em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/owatonna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Owatonna, Minnesota</em></a></p>

<p>When it comes to back pain, there's good news and bad news.</p>



<p>The good news is that back pain is rarely a sign of something serious and is often relatively short-lived. The bad news is that it's a common ailment for many adults. About 80% of adults experience pain in their back at some point in their lives.</p>



<p>Nearly 90% of back pain cases are temporary, and people make a full functional recovery within 12 weeks of the onset of their symptoms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What causes back pain?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some of the most common causes of back pain include:</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arthritis</a></h4>



<p>Lower back pain often is caused by osteoarthritis, or wear-and-tear arthritis, the most common type. Just as arthritis affects your knees, hips, wrists and shoulders, it also affects your spine. The spine has over 30 segments, each with four joints and discs, that can develop arthritis.</p>



<p>The joints in your back can swell and become larger, similar to the symptoms of arthritis in the knuckles of the hand. This inflammation and enlargement can lead to a narrowing of the space around the spinal cord or nerve roots, a condition called spinal stenosis.</p>



<p>Also, cartilage degenerates as you age, so bone-on-bone joint movement can cause pain with movement.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bulging or ruptured disks</h4>



<p>Disks are the cushioning between the bones in your spine that absorb impact, similar to the suspension on your car or a mountain bike. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/herniated-disk/expert-answers/bulging-disk/faq-20058428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disks can bulge or rupture</a> and press on a nerve. Also, they can degenerate with time and lose the ability to provide cushion for average day-to-day impact, which can result in back pain.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Muscle or ligament strain</h4>



<p>Repeatedly lifting heavy objects or twisting your back quickly can <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscle-strains/symptoms-causes/syc-20450507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strain muscles</a> and spinal ligaments. Carrying extra weight can strain your back, leading to pain.</p>



<p>It's not always possible to pinpoint a reason for back pain. Back pain can sometimes be tracked to muscle strain from a fall or lifting something heavy. More commonly, people can't tie their pain to any specific activity or event.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When should you seek care for back pain?</h2>



<p>Rarely, back pain may be a sign of something serious.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">However, you should schedule an appointment with your healthcare team if you have pain that:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Accompanies unintended weight loss</li>



<li>Arises with swelling, redness on your back and fevers, which could indicate an infection</li>



<li>Causes weakness, numbness or tingling in one or both legs</li>



<li>Follows a fall, blow to your back or another injury</li>



<li>Happens during or after cancer treatment</li>



<li>Is constant or intense, especially at night or when you lie down</li>



<li>Occurs with new bowel or bladder control problems</li>



<li>Spreads down one or both legs, especially if the pain extends below your knee</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can you find relief from back pain?</h2>



<p>Although you may want to head to the couch when you're hurting, continued light activity and stretching can help in recovery.</p>



<p>Doing regular activities and even light exercise is all right unless the activity worsens the pain. Recovering from an injury means a gradual increase in activity. Listen to your body and try to keep moving.</p>



<p>Avoid actions that further stress your back, such as bending over to tie your shoes, twisting your entire body, bending from your waist or performing high-impact exercises.</p>



<p>Rest, applying heat to the affected areas and over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen, naproxen or acetaminophen, might be enough to ease the pain. If your pain isn't better after several weeks, you may need to see your healthcare professional for an evaluation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can back pain be prevented?</h2>



<p>The best way to avoid back pain is to prevent it by taking good care of your back.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Recommended activities include:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Exercise.</strong><br>Walking, swimming and other low-impact aerobic activities can strengthen your back.</li>



<li><strong>Build muscle strength and flexibility.</strong><br>Stretching your back and strengthening your back and core muscles can support and protect your back. Plank holds and push-ups are good ways to help build your core.</li>



<li><strong>Sit, stand and lift correctly.</strong><br>Avoid slouching and standing or sitting in one position for too long. When you need to lift something heavy, lift from your legs, not your back.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight.</strong><br>Carrying extra pounds strains back muscles.</li>



<li><strong>If you smoke, quit.</strong><br>Smoking reduces blood flow through the smaller blood vessels throughout your body and can reduce your body's ability to heal injuries.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps</h2>

<p>2024 marks a pivotal year for advancing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in healthcare, requiring multidisciplinary teamwork and scientific rigor to bring these innovations to patient care.</p>



<p>These key takeaways emerged from Mayo Clinic's AI Summit, "Generative and Multimodal AI — Potentials and Challenges," held recently in Rochester. Nearly 300 attendees from Mayo Clinic and other institutions gathered in person and virtually to discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying AI technology to healthcare.</p>

<p>"As we are entering the era of artificial intelligence, AI has great potential and is already playing a critical role in revolutionizing healthcare and biomedicine," said <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tao-cui-ph-d/bio-20563927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cui Tao, Ph.D.</a>, chair of Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://intranet.mayo.edu/charlie/research-dept-ai-informatics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics</a>, in her opening remarks. Dr. Tao is the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair of AI and Informatics.</p>



<p></p>



<div style="height:23px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>"Our role as a Research shield enables us to lead innovation and discovery efforts within the AI medicine ecosystem," adds Dr. Tao. "Through collaborative research, we aim to drive advancements to significantly enhance healthcare outcomes."</p>



<p>AI integrates text, radiology images, digital pathology slides, genomics and other sources of information to assist care teams in defining disease and making predictive analyses to support clinical decision-making. This "multimodal" AI supports healthcare teams, enhancing their ability to develop innovative solutions and improve patient care.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Developing models and bridging the AI translation gap</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/halamka-john-d-m-d-m-s/bio-20542748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Halamka, M.D.</a>, the Dwight and Dian Diercks President of Mayo Clinic Platform and Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President's Strategic Initiative Professor, was a keynote speaker. He emphasized the need for AI solutions to address global healthcare challenges over the next 20 years.</p>



<p>"Culturally, I think we have an imperative to build these new solutions," he said, noting lower birthrates, higher longevity and higher demand for healthcare in many nations. Automation and AI, he explained, can be part of those solutions, enabling healthcare that is more proactive, less costly, less invasive and more focused on wellness and cures.</p>



<p>To create solutions that benefit global populations, AI developers need access to curated, de-identified data with depth, breadth and heterogeneity, said Dr. Halamka.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic hosts the largest curated, de-identified dataset in the world, he said, representing 32.5 million patients and growing. Companies such as those participating in the Mayo Clinic Platform's Accelerator program can leverage this data within a secure cloud environment to develop AI models.</p>



<p>Once developed, these models must be validated, approved by regulatory bodies and implemented so that they are easy for clinicians to use.</p>



<p>"Handing a data model and an AI model to a physician is not going to get its use and impact. It has to be fully integrated into their workflow," Dr. Halamka said. "It needs to be just-in-time, there offering appropriate advice without additional effort."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting to patients more quickly</strong></h2>



<p>Other headline speakers were Shauna Overgaard, Ph.D., senior director of AI Strategy and Frameworks, and co-director of the AI Validation and Stewardship Research Program at Mayo Clinic; <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments-offices/ai-human-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas Fuchs, D.Sc.</a>, dean of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; <a href="https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/profiles/madabhushi-anant.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anant Madabhushi, Ph.D.</a>, executive director for the&nbsp;Emory University Empathetic AI for Health Institute; and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hoifung/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hoifung Poon</a>, general manager at Microsoft Health Futures.</p>



<p>In her keynote, Dr. Overgaard discussed the "AI translation gap" between proof of concept and clinical implementation. The estimated time for translating a basic science discovery to clinical practice is 17 years, she noted. "We know that as we work toward innovation, we absolutely cannot wait 17 years."</p>



<p>Translating AI solutions into patient care involves overcoming challenges such as gaining clinician trust, ensuring reliability through continuous scientific validation, securing payer approval, and meeting regulatory requirements. These efforts ensure that AI tools efficiently augment and enhance healthcare professionals' expertise and patient care practices.</p>



<p>"Part of our work is identifying potential barriers to AI translation and then working together to close those barriers as well as streamline innovation," she said. This will require scientific rigor and multidisciplinary teamwork. Dr. Overgaard said that a solid translational process should enable stakeholders by addressing transparency, reproducibility, ethics and effectiveness. The AI Summit was hosted by the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tizhoosh-hamid-r-ph-d/bio-20530617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hamid Tizhoosh, Ph.D.</a>, Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, served as chair of the AI Summit</p>

<p>For some people, migraines are debilitating. The intense, throbbing head pain is often so severe that it feels like the head will explode.</p>



<p>"When people have migraine, they typically do have pain, typically moderate or severe pain, but they have other symptoms that go along with that," says Dr. Halker Singh.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What triggers migraines?</h3>



<p>A migraine is a neurologic disease that affects people differently. Some migraine sufferers experience sensitivity to light, sound and smells.</p>



<p>"It can impact their quality of life. It can impact their day. They typically have attacks which can be unpredictable," Dr. Halker Singh explains.</p>



<p>Extreme weather can affect various changes in the brain and cause a migraine.</p>



<p>"Many people say that barometric pressure changes and changes in the weather, but some people say it's the heat that triggers them," says Dr. Halker Singh.</p>



<p>It's crucial for migraine sufferers to stick to a routine and get plenty of exercise and rest.&nbsp; Also, it's important to stay hydrated during the summer.</p>



<p>"We really need to be careful about maintaining as much hydration as we can. And I think sometimes we don't even realize we're dehydrated. It just happens," she says.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parvovirus-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20376085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parvovirus B19</a> is the cause of Fifth disease, a mild rash typically seen in children, although adults can contract the virus. Parvovirus B19 affects only humans. You can't contract it or transmit it to dogs or cats. However, different parvoviruses can affect pets.</p>



<p>"Fifth disease is a relatively common infection in childhood," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rajapakse-nipunie-s-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20308514?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse,</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;pediatric infectious diseases physician with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's Center</a>. "It has a few names. It's caused by a virus called parvovirus B19."</p>



<p>&nbsp;For most children, symptoms are mild.</p>



<p>"The most common symptoms that children will usually have with this infection are fever, maybe some runny nose and then a characteristic rash that usually turns their cheeks bright red, and then they may develop a more kind of lacy-looking rash on their extremities and trunk," she says.</p>

<p>Adults infected with parvovirus 19 may have different symptoms than children.</p>



<p>Joint pain or swelling is less common but more frequent in adults. The virus also can temporarily stop the body from making new red blood cells, leading to anemia. People with sickle cell disease and weakened immune systems are at higher risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Rajapakse says parvovirus B19 spreads through respiratory secretions, such as contact with droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The virus can spread through blood and from a pregnant woman to her child. If a pregnant person suspects exposure to parvovirus B19, they should tell their healthcare team as soon as possible due to potential rare fetal complications if the mother lacks immunity.</p>



<p>"Parvovirus B19 is a viral infection that is quite common in childhood. If you test them, most adults show signs that they had this infection when they were a child," says Dr. Rajapakse. "The rash usually isn't causing too many symptoms, so it doesn't need any specific treatment. And as the child's body fights off the virus, the rash usually resolves along with that."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h3>



<p>There are no vaccines or medications to prevent infection, but there are ways to reduce your chances of getting infected or transmitting the infection to others.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>



<li>&nbsp;Practice good hand hygiene by covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing.</li>



<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>



<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>



<li>Stay home and avoid others when you are sick.</li>
</ul>



<p>Parvovirus B19 affects only humans. You can't contract it or transmit it to dogs or cats. However, different parvoviruses can affect pets.</p>



<p>Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, got its name from being the fifth in a list of childhood illnesses known for causing a rash,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parvovirusb19/fifth-disease.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a>&nbsp;to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>



<p>In the U.S., the virus peaks in winter and spring. The CDC reports mini outbreaks every three to four years.</p>

<p>There are dozens of <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-types-of-brain-tumors-and-treatments/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">types</a> of brain tumors, but generally, they are classified as primary or metastatic.</p>



<p>"A brain metastasis is a tumor that started elsewhere in the body that spread through the bloodstream and lodged itself in the brain," says Dr. Byrne.</p>



<p>This differs from a primary brain tumor, which starts in the brain and may require a different treatment approach.</p>

<p>"The different approaches that we take in treating brain metastases versus primary brain tumor depends on how many brain metastases there are because they often come in more than one and where they are and how large they are," says Dr. Byrne.</p>



<p>The tumor's location is also a factor in the treatment plan. A CT scan or MRI of the brain will confirm the diagnosis and create a road map for the care team to determine the next steps.</p>



<p>"After a patient is seen, and we do a history and physical exam and evaluate the imaging studies that they've had and any other data, then we come to the treatment plan," says Dr. Byrne. "And the treatment plan can vary from just watchful waiting and follow-up imaging all the way to a recommendation for radiation or surgery."</p>

<p>For many kids,&nbsp;summer is a time to stay up late, sleep in and hang out with friends. Waking up for that first day of a new school year can be a shock if young children, teenagers, parents or caregivers have not come up with a routine.</p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/whiteside-stephen-p-ph-d-l-p/bio-20054748?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stephen Whiteside</a>, a Mayo Clinic child psychologist, offers some tips for getting into a back-to-school routine.</p>

<p>Transitioning from a laid-back summer schedule to the structure of a new school year doesn't have to be a rude awakening. Dr. Whiteside says developing routines for morning,&nbsp;bedtime&nbsp;and any other recurring event can make things run more smoothly at home and at school.</p>



<p>"Routines are a natural part of life and just very straightforward, provide structure, help kids predict and expect what's going to happen," says Dr. Whiteside.</p>



<p>One way to help make the transition a little smoother is to give your family time to ease into the new routine.</p>



<p>"Taking a week or so before school starts to help kids start adjusting to waking up earlier, getting ready and having breakfast as soon as they get up," says Dr. Whiteside.</p>



<p>Dr. Whiteside says parents shouldn't stress if things don't go exactly as planned.</p>



<p>"Kids need to learn that they can handle change. And having a routine is good. Learning that you can handle life not following that routine is equally good," says Dr. Whiteside.</p>

<p>Historically, men have been hesitant to seek medical attention when something seems wrong with their health. Also, men aren't as likely as women to have preventive screenings and checkups with their healthcare team. This is a problem because early detection of a medical issue is the best way to treat and manage it effectively.</p>



<p>Why should you reconsider your reservations about seeing a healthcare professional? Delaying or avoiding a checkup or screening could lead to a treatable situation turning deadly.</p>



<p>While you should get some screenings, such as HIV and hepatitis C, you should have other screenings for certain conditions and cancers regularly.</p>



<p>Vaccines also are essential to prevent infectious diseases. Vaccinations for men are administered at different intervals throughout adulthood.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Regular physical exams</h2>



<p>Males older than 50 should have a yearly physical exam, and those younger than 50 should have a physical exam every three to five years. Even if you're feeling healthy, a regular checkup with your healthcare team is an excellent way to validate your health or identify a problem in its early stages.</p>



<p>Another thing to think about: Health isn't only physical. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/trust-primary-care-provider" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Talk to your healthcare team</a> about your mental and emotional health. If you're struggling in those areas, effective help is available.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Screening can identify specific conditions and cancers, including:</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Abdominal aortic aneurysm</h4>



<p>For men between 65 and 75 who have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends a one-time abdominal aortic aneurysm screening ultrasound. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the aorta, the major blood vessel that supplies blood to the body. Because the aorta is the body's main supplier of blood, a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm can cause life-threatening bleeding. Men over 60 with a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm should consider repeat screening at regular intervals.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Colon cancer</h4>



<p>Colon cancer screening should begin at age 45 or 10 years prior to an age at which an immediate relative was diagnosed with colon cancer. For example, get screened at age 36 if your mother was diagnosed at age 46. A colonoscopy is a traditional, effective procedure to identify colon cancer or precancerous polyps. A more recent noninvasive option available is a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stool-dna-test/about/pac-20385153" target="_blank">take-home test to screen for colon cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Talk to your healthcare professional about which option is best for you.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Diabetes</h4>



<p>If you're older than 45 or have a body mass index above 25, no matter your age, the American Diabetes Association recommends that you be screened for diabetes. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/how-to-live-well-with-diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Type 2 diabetes</a> and prediabetes symptoms can happen slowly and may not be noticeable, so staying aware of your blood sugar levels and risk of developing diabetes is essential.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">High blood pressure</h4>



<p>A blood pressure reading is a good indication to many aspects of your health. High blood pressure can lead to many physical problems, especially those associated with the heart.</p>



<p>You should have your blood pressure checked at least every two years. However, talk to your healthcare professional about having it checked more frequently if you have <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/know-your-heart-health-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a> or are at risk of developing high blood pressure.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">High cholesterol</h4>



<p>Like high blood pressure, high cholesterol may pose serious risks to your health and well-being. Starting at age 18, men at average risk for heart disease should have a cholesterol screening every five years. If you have a family history of high cholesterol or heart attacks, smoke, eat a poor diet, are overweight, have diabetes, are physically inactive or older than 45, you may need more frequent testing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Lung cancer</h4>



<p>The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with a low-dose CT for adults ages 50 to 80 who have a 20-pack-per-year smoking history, currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening can be stopped when a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Prostate cancer</h4>



<p>Many organizations advise men to be screened for prostate cancer starting at age 50. However, the subject is somewhat controversial, so the best course of action is to discuss what's best for you with your healthcare team.</p>



<p>Do yourself and your family a favor by protecting your health with regular checkups and screenings.</p>
