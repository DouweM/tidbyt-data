<p>Getting a good night's sleep can give you the energy to jump-start your day and your health.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's usually recommended for you to sleep at least seven hours per night in order to allow your body to recover to be ready for the following day," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical steps to help you get better sleep</strong></h2>



<p>"Try to sleep at the same time. Try to get a schedule in which you're going to sleep at the same time and you're waking up also at the same time, that's very important," Dr. Cardenas Rosales says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Create good sleep habits</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Keep the time you go to bed and the time you wake up the same every day, including weekends.</li>



<li>Stay active. Regular activity can lead to a good night's sleep.</li>



<li>Limit naps or do not nap at all.</li>



<li>Limit or do not use caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.</li>



<li>Do not eat large meals or drink a lot of fluids before bed.</li>



<li>Make your bedroom comfortable.</li>



<li>Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading or listening to soft music.</li>
</ul>



<p>"You want to set up the environment to make it easier for your body to fall asleep," he says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I'm in the first trimester of my pregnancy, and I know that heart disease runs in my family. What are the warning signs of heart failure during pregnancy? How can I safely manage or prevent this?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>First of all, congratulations on being proactive and voicing your concern for yourself and your baby. There are some specific <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular</a> conditions, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>, which occur during pregnancy. Symptoms from this can overlap with normal pregnancy symptoms such as swelling of the legs, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/expert-answers/swelling-during-pregnancy/faq-20058467#:~:text=Although%20mild%20foot%20and%20ankle,pressure%20is%20higher%20than%20normal." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ankles</a> and feet, and shortness of breath while lying in bed at night on your back and while walking short distances. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to tell if the symptoms are from normal pregnancy or signs of heart failure. If you are concerned about any of these symptoms, especially if they worsen, please discuss them with your healthcare team early on, and they can determine if any testing might be needed.</p>



<p>During pregnancy, we recommend the same things that we would if a woman were not pregnant, which is following all the guidelines to ensure ideal or optimal cardiovascular health. Don't smoke, eat a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-nutrition/art-20045082#:~:text=During%20pregnancy%2C%20the%20basic%20principles,lean%20protein%20and%20healthy%20fats." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy diet</a> and maintain a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-weight-gain/art-20044360">healthy weight</a> (which is somewhat different for pregnancy because there is a normal amount of weight gain expected). Getting enough <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/womens-wellness-sleep-tips-during-pregnancy/">sleep</a> is also important. Seven to eight hours of sleep at night is recommended for ideal heart health. You'll want to make sure that you're getting specific things checked by your healthcare team during pregnancy, including your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy/art-20046098#:~:text=High%20blood%20pressure%20during%20pregnancy%20poses%20the%20following%20risks%3A,birth%20weight%20or%20premature%20birth." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/glucose-tolerance-test/about/pac-20394296#:~:text=Gestational%20diabetes,-If%20you're&amp;text=At%20Mayo%20Clinic%2C%20if%20your,be%20diagnosed%20with%20gestational%20diabetes." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood glucose</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cholesterol-test/about/pac-20384601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood lipids</a>. If treatment is needed, act on it as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>We also get questions about <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-exercises/art-20546799#:~:text=Staying%20active%20during%20pregnancy%20can,a%20well%2Drounded%20exercise%20program." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise for pregnant women</a>. If you were exercising before getting pregnant, it is usually safe to continue the same level of activity that you had before pregnancy. If you were not exercising before pregnancy and want to start an exercise program, it's important to check in with your healthcare team first. Start small and slow — don't push yourself too quickly.</p>



<p>Heart failure can be challenging to diagnose during pregnancy. We also know that a delay in the diagnosis of heart failure during this time also contributes significantly to the risk of dying from heart failure. Currently, there is no recommended single test to identify heart failure during pregnancy. The diagnosis often requires your healthcare team to assess your symptoms in addition to other clinical signs and consider testing which may include an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)</a>, blood test, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chest-x-rays/about/pac-20393494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest X-ray</a> and a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart ultrasound</a>. This is why we are working on a research study that utilizes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ai-cardiology/overview/ovc-20486648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artificial intelligence</a> to analyze data from an ECG to predict the likelihood of cardiac dysfunction or heart failure. This test is simple, readily available in most clinics, rapid (can be done within 10-30 seconds) and, most importantly, safe for you and your baby. The test provides a prediction that can tell you if a woman is at high risk for heart failure or not.</p>



<p>Based on our preliminary studies, we have evidence showing this test is very effective. If we can demonstrate its usefulness in larger research studies, we believe that this test can lead to a major shift in how we care for pregnant and postpartum women. <em><strong>— </strong></em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20502753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Demilade Adedinsewo, M.B., Ch.B.</strong></a><strong><em>, Cardiovascular Medicine, </em></strong><em><strong>Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I recently had a CAT scan of my chest as an evaluation for pneumonia. I didn’t have pneumonia, but I got an unexpected high calcium score in my coronary arteries. Does the calcium I eat affect this? I thought calcium was related to bone health? Now I'm being evaluated for my risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>. Should others in my family get their calcium score?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-scan/about/pac-20384686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary calcium scan</a> is a risk assessment tool that helps your healthcare team recommend if measures are needed to lower your risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>. The scan may show the presence of disease even before someone has symptoms, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/definition/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a> and fatigue.</p>



<p>Calcium from the foods we eat or calcium supplements do not have a significant impact on coronary artery calcification.</p>



<p>A coronary calcium scan predicts your amount of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atherosclerosis</a>, which is cholesterol and other substances that build up and narrow your arteries and can potentially cause a blood clot. Calcium is present in this buildup, called coronary plaque. The more calcium you have in your coronary arteries, the more plaque you have. The more plaque, the higher your risk for coronary artery disease.</p>



<p>The coronary calcium scan starts with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> of your chest that measures calcification in the arteries that feed your heart. It's typically a one-time test that combines a series of X-ray images of your body. If calcification is found, we usually don't repeat the test. If zero calcification is found, we would repeat the scan a few years later to see if the score changes.</p>



<p>Scores must be interpreted in the context of a person's age and other individual risk factors. For the most part, when calcium gets in your arteries, it stays there; it doesn't get removed. But by lowering your cholesterol level through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/cholesterol/art-20045192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diet</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/statins/art-20045772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medications</a>, the cholesterol gets removed and the plaque stabilizes.</p>



<p>Nowadays a calcium score can be derived from any chest CT scan, if no contrast dye is used. In your case, a chest CT scan for pneumonia also showed a high calcium score, even though that was not the initial intent of the test. I commend your healthcare team for using your calcium result to offer you follow-up assessment and possible treatment based on your risk of a heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>Certain people do not need to get their calcium score. For example, for people who already take a cholesterol medication or who have had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angioplasty/about/pac-20384761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stent</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-bypass-surgery/about/pac-20384589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery bypass surgery</a>, a calcium score is not needed. In those situations, they already are taking steps to reduce their risk.</p>



<p>People with a family history of heart disease may want to discuss a coronary calcium scan with their healthcare specialist. For example, if you have first-degree relatives who have had <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attacks</a>, but your cholesterol is not high, a superficial risk assessment may say you're at low risk. A calcium score is going to be able to evaluate risk more precisely and indicate if additional testing should be done. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/fernandes-regis-i-m-d/bio-20305254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Regis Fernandes, M.D.</strong></em></a><em>,<strong> Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix</strong></em></p>

<p>Preventing a stroke is a crucial aspect of healthcare, as about 80% of all strokes are preventable. The focus is on managing risk factors to reduce the long-term risk of stroke.</p>



<p>A stroke results from a blocked or torn blood vessel that decreases blood flow to the brain. In the U.S., stroke is a leading cause of death and disability.</p>



<p>“Because about 80% of all strokes are preventable, we really focus on prevention,” says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/english-stephen-w-jr-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20491968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stephen English</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/neurology/home/orc-20117057?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurologist</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing stroke risks</h2>



<p>Tips for lowering stroke risk include maintaining blood pressure under 130/80 and keeping cholesterol and blood glucose at appropriate levels.</p>



<p>"(Other modifiable risks include) things like smoking cessation, treatment of sleep apnea with a CPAP device, and some other potential treatments," he says. "We want to make sure that the risk factors are mitigated to help reduce the long-term risk of stroke."</p>



<p>There are risk factors for stroke that cannot be changed. These include age, sex, race and family history. “There are four nonmodifiable risk factors we typically think about. The first is age, so age greater than 55; males; people that have a family history of prior stroke; and then people that are of African American descent,” says Dr. English.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I've heard from some of my relatives that heart disease runs in our family, so I've been reading a lot about different conditions. I can barely pronounce it, but what is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> It is a mouthful. Let's break it down a little. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a> (HCM) is a condition where the heart (cardio) muscle (myopathy) becomes thickened (hypertrophied). HCM is the most common type of genetic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiomyopathy</a>. Patients are born with a gene that makes the heart muscle thicker than it should be.</p>



<p>HCM can be a silent disease, and some people live their whole lives not knowing they have it. We sometimes find it by chance during imaging or an autopsy for a separate reason. However, some patients, at some point in their life, can start experiencing increased heart rhythm issues, which puts these patients at risk of sudden death. In many cases, the first sign of HCM can be <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden cardiac death</a>. Making the right diagnosis at the right time is critical in this condition.</p>



<p>HCM also can create stiffness in the heart muscles and block the outflow of blood from the heart. These patients come to us with a variety of symptoms, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/causes/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-fainting/basics/art-20056606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fainting</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dizziness/symptoms-causes/syc-20371787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dizziness</a>. It is important to seek medical attention when you have any of these symptoms. If a young athlete passes out during exercise, for example, it's important that they get checked by getting an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram</a> (ECG or EKG) and an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>.</p>



<p>HCM is not as rare as people think. Data suggests that 1 in 200 to 500 people worldwide have HCM. The problem is that it often goes undiagnosed or missed. Right now, in the U.S., we believe we've only diagnosed 1 out of 7 of the people who have HCM. We are trying to increase awareness in the community about this disease and make sure that healthcare teams are well educated so they don't miss the diagnosis when they look at the imaging of these patients.</p>



<p>It's important to remember that just because you carry the gene doesn't mean you will develop HCM. Some people show signs of HCM at a younger age, in their teens or 20s, while others can show signs of the disease later in life, into their 50s. Knowing your family history and paying close attention to whether anybody in the family was told they have a thick heart muscle or if a family member suddenly died at a young age are the kinds of questions that can lead to clues if you have a genetic factor for HCM.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, we offer a genetic test for those suspected of having HCM and to family members of affected patients. We mail a kit to the patient's home, and they do a swab from inside the mouth and send it back. Within two weeks, we get the results back and can either confirm the diagnosis or find out if they have other diseases that may look like HCM. Genetic testing can be helpful in ruling out these other conditions.</p>



<p>My hope is for people to think about it when they see patients with abnormal heart sounds or have symptoms that might suggest this condition. When treating patients, we should always ask, "Can this be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?" The eyes won't see what the mind doesn't know, so it's always good to have it at the back of your mind. You really can save people's lives by diagnosing it early and referring them in a timely fashion. We have a lot of new treatments that can help these patients surgically or medically, so making the right diagnosis will improve patient survival and their quality of life. <em><strong>— </strong></em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/alsidawi-said-m-d/bio-20516525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Said Alsidawi, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic</em></strong></p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A recent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> study suggests that active workstations incorporating a walking pad, bike, stepper and/or standing desk are successful strategies for reducing sedentary time and improving mental cognition at work without reducing job performance. Extended sedentary behavior, whether at work or home, increases a person's risk of preventable <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351916?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic diseases</a>.</p>



<p>"Our findings suggest that it is feasible to blend movement with office work that previously would have been done during long periods of sitting. Active workstations may offer a way to potentially improve cognitive performance and overall health, simply by moving at work," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, a preventive cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study.</p>



<p>The research involved 44 participants in a randomized clinical trial where four office settings were evaluated over four consecutive days at Mayo Clinic's Dan Abraham Healthy Living Center. Study findings are published in the <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.031228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Heart Association</a>. The settings included a stationary or sitting station on the first day, followed by three active workstations (standing, walking or using a stepper) in a randomized order. Researchers analyzed participants' neurocognitive function based on 11 assessments that evaluated reasoning, short-term memory and concentration. Fine motor skills were assessed through an online typing speed test and other tests. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When participants used the active workstations, their brain function either improved or stayed the same, and their typing speed slowed down only a bit. However, the accuracy of their typing was not affected.&nbsp;The study revealed improved reasoning scores when standing, stepping and walking as compared with sitting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Being sedentary is the new smoking when it comes to your cardiovascular health, and office workers may spend a large part of their eight-hour workday sitting at a computer screen and keyboard. These findings indicate that there are more ways to do that work while remaining productive and mentally sharp. We would do well to consider an active workstation in the prescription for prevention and treatment of conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>When you think of high blood pressure, you probably already know that it can cause cardiovascular diseases. But that's not all.</p>



<p>"It also can lead to chronic kidney disease," says Dr. Porter.</p>



<p>He says high blood pressure can cause the kidneys' blood vessels to weaken and damage the kidneys.</p>

<p>"As chronic kidney disease develops, many people will develop hypertension, they seem to go hand in hand. Conversely, people with hypertension develop chronic kidney disease as well," says Dr. Porter. "Control of high blood pressure is one of the most important things we can do when someone has chronic kidney disease."</p>



<p>And how you control it, mostly involves lifestyle changes.</p>



<p>"The thing about high blood pressure is it responds to many of the things we do in our lifestyle: regular exercise, avoiding processed foods, reduction of our sodium intake, more fruits and vegetables in our regular diet," says Dr. Porter. "Sometimes those lifestyle changes aren't enough. And these are the patients that need medications to help with blood pressure control. But we can make a huge impact with the decisions we make in our lifestyle to control blood pressure."</p>

<p><em>Mayo Clinic research finds a connection between Social Network Index score and AI-determined biological age</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new study from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> finds that socially isolated people are more likely to show signs of being biologically older than their age and more likely to die from a variety of causes. The research, published in the <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2024.100890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Advances</a>, suggests that social connection plays an important role in overall physical health and longevity, and it should be addressed as a necessary part of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/socialdeterminants/faq.html#what-are-social-determinants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social determinants of health</a>.</p>



<p>To investigate the role of social contact in biological aging, the researchers compared the Social Network Index and AI-enabled <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram</a> (AI-ECG)-predicted age gaps of over 280,000 adults who received outpatient care between June 2019 and March 2022. Eligible participants completed a questionnaire on the social determinants of health and had AI-ECG records independent of the study on file within one year.</p>



<p>An AI-ECG model developed at Mayo Clinic was used to estimate biological age, which was then compared to chronological age. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ai-enabled-ekgs-find-difference-between-numerical-age-and-biological-age-significantly-affects-health-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Previous research</a> shows that the AI-ECG age prediction represents the heart's biological age. A positive age gap indicates accelerated biological aging, while a negative value suggests slower biological aging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers assessed social isolation using the Social Network Index, which asks six distinct multiple-choice questions related to these areas of social interaction:</p>



<ul>
<li>Belonging to any social club or organization.</li>



<li>Frequency of participating in social activities per year.</li>



<li>Frequency of talking on the telephone with family and friends per week.</li>



<li>Frequency of attending church or religious services per year.</li>



<li>Frequency of getting together with friends or family in person per week.</li>



<li>Marital status or living with a partner.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each question response was given a score of 0 or 1, and the total score tallies ranged from 0 to 4, representing varying degrees of social isolation.</p>



<p>Participants with a higher Social Network Index score — indicating a better social network — had a smaller AI-ECG age gap, and that held true across all gender and age groups. Social network status significantly influenced mortality risk. During the two-year follow-up period, approximately 5% of the participants died. Those who had low social index scores less than or equal to 1 had the highest risk of death compared to other groups.</p>



<p>While the participants were 86.3% non-Hispanic white, the study data point to existing health disparities. Non-white participants had higher average age gaps than their white counterparts, especially those with lower Social Network Index scores.</p>



<p>"This study highlights the critical interplay between social isolation, health and aging," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lerman-amir-m-d/bio-00078051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amir Lerman, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the paper. "Social isolation combined with demographic and medical conditions appears to be a significant risk factor for accelerated aging. But we also know that people can change their behavior — have more social interaction, exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, get adequate sleep, etc. Making and sustaining these changes may go a long way toward improving overall health."</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease kills more Americans than any other condition.

<p>There are several contributing factors, including genetics, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-why-southern-food-is-linked-to-high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension,</a> obesity and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Type 2 diabetes</a>.&nbsp;Diet can play a key role in the development of heart disease and its risk factors. This is particularly true for Black people in the U.S., for whom traditional dishes, often referred to as "soul food," were often developed from unhealthy ingredients — by necessity.</p>



<p>During slavery, enslaved people were given leftovers and undesirable portions of meat. Over time, these foods have evolved and have become a part of African American cuisine, according to <a href="https://www.blackfoodie.co/the-humble-history-of-soul-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Foodie</a>. But some Southern foods can put you at risk for heart disease, depending on how often you eat them and how the dishes are prepared.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some soul foods can put you at risk for heart disease</h3>



<p>But soul food is sometimes loaded with sodium, sugar and fat, which makes those foods high in flavor but can also raise your risk of heart disease. Dr. LaPrincess Brewer suggests that people make subtle changes to their diet.</p>



<p>"Focus on portion control, lower fat, lower sodium content, and really focus on the fresh foods, so fresh fruits and vegetables, and integrate those into your diet," explains Dr. Brewer.</p>



<p>Instead of ham, use smoked turkey meat and natural seasonings like oregano and cumin, which can add flavor without all the sodium and fat.</p>



<p>"We may need to revamp how we prepare them by substituting more healthier ingredients so that we can live healthier but still preserve our culture," says Dr. Brewer.</p>

<p>Eau Claire, Wis. — Most people have heard of heart attacks occurring because of a blocked coronary artery. But the body has two types of artery systems: the coronary artery system, which relates to the heart, and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/peripheral-artery-disease-can-signal-cardiovascular-trouble-for-heart-brain-and-legs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peripheral artery system</a>, which involves the arteries carrying oxygenated blood to the arms, legs, brain and the rest of the body.</p>



<p>"Just like coronary arteries, peripheral arteries can become diseased," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/michel-barsoum-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michel Barsoum, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/cardiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/vascular-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vascular medicine</a> specialist at Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/chippewa-falls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chippewa Falls</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eau Claire</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/rice-lake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rice Lake</a>, Wisconsin. "This condition, called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-is-peripheral-artery-disease-diagnosed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peripheral artery disease,</a> or PAD, narrows arteries and reduces blood flow due to a buildup of fatty and calcium deposits on the artery walls."</p>



<p>This can cause claudication, which is muscle pain and cramping when a person is active but usually disappears after a few minutes of rest.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risk factors for peripheral artery disease</h3>



<p>"So who is at risk of peripheral artery disease? People who smoke or have diabetes at any age are at the greatest risk," says Dr. Barsoum.</p>



<p><strong>Other risk factors include:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Body mass index&nbsp;over 30.</li>



<li>Family history&nbsp;of PAD, heart disease or stroke.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High blood pressure</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High cholesterol</a>.</li>



<li>Increasing age, especially if you are 65 or older.<br></li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Symptoms include:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aching or cramping in the arms when knitting, writing or performing other manual tasks.</li>



<li>Change in the color of your leg or arm.</li>



<li>Coldness of the lower leg or foot even after walking in a warm weather.</li>



<li>Sores on the toes, feet or leg that don't heal.</li>



<li>Weakening pulse in the foot.</li>



<li>Erectile dysfunction in men.</li>



<li>Hair loss on the legs.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>"If neck arteries to your brain are affected, symptoms may include difficulty talking, weakness in the arms and legs, or loss of vision," says Dr. Barsoum. "If you experience any of these symptoms, make an appointment with a vascular medicine specialist, who will conduct a physical exam and record your health history."</p>



<p>The exam will include finding a pulse in the affected neck artery and comparing it with the pulse in the unaffected neck artery. Vascular medicine specialists have a wide range of tools available, depending on the degree of your symptoms, to help you return to the activities you love.</p>



<p>For example, if you can walk a few blocks with only mild pain, they may prescribe medications such as aspirin, statins or blood thinners. They also may discuss ways you can modify your risk factors, including quitting smoking; controlling blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes; and increasing your activity level.</p>



<p>If you have more significant symptoms, such as not being able to tolerate the pain when walking, a vascular medicine specialist typically will order an ultrasound or a CT scan with contrast, or even an angiogram to determine the location and degree of the blockage. Your care team will discuss a variety of surgical options to deal with the blockage.</p>



<p>"Prevention of peripheral artery disease is always the best treatment," says Dr. Barsoum. "Quit smoking, eat a heart-healthy diet, exercise regularly, keep your blood sugar in check if you have diabetes, maintain a healthy weight, and manage your blood pressure and cholesterol levels."</p>



<p>In addition, if you have one or more risk factors, avoid certain over-the-counter cold remedies that contain&nbsp;pseudoephedrine. These medications constrict your blood vessels and might worsen your symptoms.</p>
