The findings also show that the surgical weight-loss procedure reduced cardiovascular risks, including diabetes and hypertension.</p>



<p>"In earlier research, we found that conservative weight-loss approaches do not adequately result in significant weight loss in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kukla-aleksandra-m-d/bio-20241280?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aleksandra Kukla, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant nephrologist and the study's first author. "These new findings support the value of surgical gastrectomy for patients with advanced chronic kidney failure, stage 4-5D, to improve general health and access to kidney transplantation."</p>



<p>The retrospective study involved 104 patients with advanced chronic kidney failure and obesity who were treated at Mayo Clinic between 2020 and 2023. Fifty-four underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, the most frequently performed surgical weight-loss procedure in patients seeking kidney transplant, and 50 patients opted for a nonsurgical weight-loss approach.</p>



<p>Undergoing sleeve gastrectomy reduced the time for patients to be added to waiting lists for kidney transplantation. It also improved the likelihood of receiving a transplant, with 37% of those who underwent sleeve gastrectomy receiving a transplant within 18 months, versus 10% in the nonsurgical cohort.</p>



<p>The risk of postsurgical complications was low, and the rate of hospitalizations and infections for patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy was similar to the nonsurgical cohort.</p>



<p>Effective therapy for obesity among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is understudied, in part because high <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/in-depth/bmi-calculator/itt-20084938?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">body mass index (BMI)</a> is often considered beneficial in patients receiving <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/dialysis-programs/overview/ovc-20464948?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney dialysis</a>. "Treatment of obesity in this population has been limited to nonsurgical options in the past," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tayyab Diwan, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon and co-author of the study.</p>



<p>More research is needed on the optimal timing of the surgery for kidney transplant candidates, Dr. Diwan says.</p>

<p>In 2020, just as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a> was breaking throughout the world, 60-year-old Gerald (Gerry) Polcari had a sudden <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gallstones/symptoms-causes/syc-20354214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gallstone attack</a> that blocked his biliary system. In addition to experiencing extreme pain, Gerry's kidney and liver began to fail. He went into septic shock and eventually necrotizing pancreatitis. Gerry had previously enjoyed a healthy life with no symptoms or warning signs that anything was wrong. After four months in a Boston-area hospital without family being able to visit due to COVID-19 restrictions, his doctors were unable to determine why he was not recovering. However, they were able to determine he had suffered irreparable damage to the biliary system of his liver. He would eventually be diagnosed with a rare condition called secondary sclerosing cholangitis, which results from a loss of oxygen to the liver.</p>



<p>Gerry would learn that the only treatment for his condition would be a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant</a>. "I was, of course, incredulous when they told me that the only treatment was a liver transplant," says Gerry. "How could this have happened to me? I was living my best life — both personally and professionally. I had signed up as an organ donor when I originally got my license at age 16, but never in a thousand years expected to have to be on the receiving end of an organ transplant."</p>



<p>Gerry was listed for a transplant in Boston in September 2020, and he remained critically ill because his liver could not clear toxins. He was hospitalized every six to eight weeks throughout 2020 and 2021 with recurring sepsis, frequently undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures (ERCP) to clear out his biliary system.</p>



<p>"I was on a first-name basis with many of the doctors and technicians in the ERCP process," he says. "Due to my extended hospitalization, I had lost over 50 pounds and eventually was on a feeding tube for nearly one year. Needless to say, it was not an experience I would wish on anyone."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="893" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari2-893x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-386441" style="aspect-ratio:16/9;object-fit:cover;width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari2-893x1024.jpg 893w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari2-262x300.jpg 262w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari2-768x881.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari2.jpg 933w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" /></figure>



<p>As a result of the recurring sepsis and biliary issues, Gerry became increasingly antibiotic-resistant from repeated treatment for sepsis, and in June of 2021, his medical team in Boston was concerned that they were running out of antibiotics to treat him. They feared he could die from an infection. The doctors recommended that he and his family consider being evaluated at other transplant centers where the average Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at transplant was lower than it was in New England, thereby improving his odds for a lifesaving liver transplant. His infectious diseases physician in Boston highly recommended he transfer to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> to be evaluated and seek another opinion.</p>



<p>Gerry and his family arrived in Florida for an evaluation in July of 2021. "My wife had to push me through the airport in a wheelchair — that’s how weak I was," he recalls. "I was very much afraid that I would never physically recover and would be an invalid for the remainder of my life. But arriving here and looking around, we were immediately struck by the natural beauty of northern Florida. After a few weeks, I started to notice that my health improved marginally because I was able to be more physically active — walking on the beach primarily."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic accepted Gerry into the transplant program in August 2021. That was when he and his wife decided to relocate to Florida so that he could continue to be active outdoors, especially in contrast to the cold winters up north. He waited about seven months for the final call that resulted in his liver transplant in February 2022.</p>



<p>"During my nearly two years of serious illness, I received seven calls for possible transplant," says Gerry. "It was an emotional process to have our hopes dashed six times. But the seventh call was the charm, and I am forever grateful for my donor's and their family's decision to donate their loved one's organs."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari3-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-386442" style="aspect-ratio:16/9;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari3-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari3-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari3-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Gerald-Gerry-Polcari3-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Today, Gerry says he is "doing amazingly well, better than ever anticipated."</p>



<p>"I had experienced such a catastrophic illness that damaged everything in my body that I feared I would remain incapacitated for the remainder of my life," he says. "I am happy to report that my new liver is working well, and over the past two years, I have gradually recovered my physical health."</p>



<p>In addition to his transplant, Gerry credits the care he received at Mayo Clinic and its atmosphere with saving his life. "I have such respect for the Mayo philosophy — of healing the whole person," he says. "The artwork, gardens and occasional piano music are so peaceful. The facilities are state-of-the-art, and I always had the sense that all the staff — from the cleaning people to the transplant surgeons — always had my best interests at heart. The care of my Mayo doctors and nurses was exemplary, and the utmost attention was given to my incredibly complicated case."</p>



<p>It was not just the hospital staff that had an impact on Gerry and his recovery. He also gained a sense of community and purpose from fellow liver transplant patients before and after his transplant.</p>



<p>"I was immediately connected to a liver transplant support group that continues to be a source of purpose for me," says Gerry. "I met others who were thriving after their transplants, which inspired me during some dark days. As we joke amongst ourselves, we are all members of a club we never asked to join. I continue to be involved and pay it forward by helping people new to the group and in that same frightening and lonely place."</p>



<p>Following his transplant, Gerry vowed to give back to Mayo Clinic through volunteer work. Before returning to full-time work, he volunteered on the transplant floor as a nurse aide, restocking supplies and cleaning nursing stations, among other tasks. Through his volunteering, he was able to reconnect with some of the people who took care of him. "That was incredibly heartening to be able to thank them in person for all they did for me," says Gerry. He also volunteers with LifeQuest Organ Recovery Services doing tabling events and speaking at various programs about his transplant experience.</p>



<p>"Our goal is to try to get people to sign up as organ donors as there is such a shortage nationally of healthy organs and over 100,000 people just like me — incredibly sick, with no treatment options other than an organ transplant," says Gerry. "Additionally, I have remained involved in the Second Chance Support Group, offering my perspective to pretransplant patients, and offering to meet them in person if they are local so they can see with their own eyes that it's possible to regain good health and an amazing quality of life. I never actually believed that would ever be possible again for me, but yet, here I am, forever grateful for having my own second chance at life."</p>

<p>This <a href="https://donatelife.net/news/april-is-national-donate-life-month/">Donate Life Month</a>, Gerry encourages others to consider giving someone a second chance at life by becoming an organ donor. "I would say that it is the last gift you can bestow on the world, a gift that means a second chance to a very sick patient and their family," he says. "Because of my donor, I have lived to not only regain my good health, but to continue on my life's journey. In January, I welcomed my first grandchild into this world — something that I was not sure I would ever live to see. No words can describe how incredibly grateful I am for my donor's final act of generosity."</p>

<p>Each April, the country celebrates <a href="https://donatelife.net/how-you-can-help/national-observances-celebrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donate Life Month</a>, an observance to raise awareness about the importance of organ donation, celebrating donors' incredible generosity and inspiring others to consider becoming organ donors. It is also a time to celebrate the unique contributions transplant nurses make to the lives of their patients. Inspired by her work and her mother, Stephanie Donelan, a post-liver transplant coordinator at Mayo Clinic in Florida, gave her role as a transplant nurse new meaning by becoming an altruistic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-kidney-transplant/pyc-20384838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living kidney donor</a>.</p>



<p>"I decided to be a living kidney donor because of my exposure to the world of transplant," says Stephanie. "Working with the transplant team, I've had the opportunity to see the need that there is for organ transplants. I know there are plenty of people on the waiting list who don't get an organ. We deal with people who have been really sick, either very acutely or for a really long time, and it's pretty incredible to get to see people with a new lease on life."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="fluidEmbed"><iframe loading="lazy" id="videoidfEq0oYkxzOs"  title="Inspired by her mother, career, transplant nurse altruistically becomes organ donor" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fEq0oYkxzOs?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>In addition to her work and the patients she serves, Stephanie's mother also inspired her decision.</p>



<p>"My mom was diagnosed with early-onset dementia," she shares. "I think, as someone who has had a loved one with a chronic health condition and feeling kind of helpless to do anything, it put me in a position where, when there was an opportunity to make a difference, I felt pretty motivated."</p>



<p>There are nearly 90,000 people on the waiting list for a kidney transplant in the U.S. Unfortunately, the demand for kidneys exceeds the supply. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-a-living-donor-chain/">Living donor chains</a> are giving hope to those in need of vital organs.</p>



<p>"A living kidney donor chain is when someone altruistically donates a kidney, meaning donates a kidney with not a specific individual in mind, that can start a chain effect of donors," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463">Dr. Shennen Mao</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Stephanie Donelan sitting up in a hospital bed reading a book.." class="wp-image-386255" style="width:464px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/SD1-1x1-1.jpg 1331w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>"Stephanie's story is an incredibly motivating story," says Dr. Mao. "We have somebody who has really given her career to transplant as a nurse taking care of patients, and then to be motivated to donate a kidney to start a chain and influence the lives of complete strangers going forward — I think her story is just incredible, really practicing what we preach in the transplant community."</p>



<p>Stephanie credits her colleagues and care team, including other transplant nurses, for putting her mind at ease and supporting a quick recovery. "I think because I had so much trust in my care team here I really didn't feel nervous," she says. "I felt very confident in my decision to donate. The level of attention here at Mayo Clinic is really unique."</p>

<p>"I think my mom would be really proud of my kidney donation," says Stephanie. "The values she instilled in me from the time of my childhood is carrying on."</p>

<p>"We would like people to consider living kidney donation because it saves lives. We can get people better matched kidneys through a larger pool of donors," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>He says a common misconception is that a kidney donor needs to be a first-degree relative.</p>



<p>"Anyone can be a living kidney donor and does not need to be relative. It can be unrelated, can be an acquaintance or can be anyone," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>Another myth is the donor kidney needs come from a person of the same race.</p>



<p>"A kidney is a kidney. It doesn't matter whatever race you are; you should consider living kidney donation," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>He says if you're worried that you might be too old to donate, you shouldn't. If you're healthy and over 18, you might be a match.</p>



<p>"In general, we typically say up to 70 years, but, in fact, there is no age limit for living kidney donation," says Dr. Issa.</p>



<p>Up until recently, anyone with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 2 diabetes</a> was ruled out as a living donor. But now, based on certain health requirements, some of those candidates may be eligible.</p>



<p>"By expanding the criteria to allow more individuals with type 2 diabetes to be potential donors, we can close the gap between the high demand for organs and the need for kidney transplants," says Dr. Issa.</p>

<p>The South Dakota native says she closely follows two teams: "The Bison for North Dakota and the Dallas Cowboys."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are two teams with storied histories. But there's a third team that tops them both, at least in Britiny's mind. "I have an amazing team here," she says.</p>

<p>"Here" is the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/sections/overview/ovc-20203894?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant center at Mayo Clinic</a>. Britiny was born with a congenital heart defect. As a young girl, she was able to live with the issue, but slowly her symptoms took their toll. In 2016, Britiny underwent a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/lung-transplant/sections/overview/ovc-20212476?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double-lung transplant</a>. Then, in the fall of 2022, she says she started having new troubles.</p>



<p>"Couldn't really do a whole lot. You know, just was tired all the time. Lost my breath doing anything, you know, stuff like that. Just couldn't keep up with everyday life," Britiny says.</p>



<p>A trip back to Mayo in early 2023 uncovered the problem. "She developed a very serious lung infection called scedosporium, which is very, very difficult to treat. And, unfortunately, it led to a decline in her lung function," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/saddoughi-sahar-m-d-ph-d/bio-20533719?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sahar Saddoughi</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="885" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/with-DR2-885x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385559" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/with-DR2-885x1024.jpg 885w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/with-DR2-259x300.jpg 259w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/with-DR2-768x889.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/with-DR2.jpg 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Saddoughi and Britiny</figcaption></figure>



<p>The good news is that Britiny's new heart remained strong. The bad news is that once the fungal infection is in the lungs, it's very hard to get rid of. Dr. Saddoughi says she knew they needed to approach Britiny's case differently. "Can we just retransplant her lungs, keep her heart there and then treat her with very potent antifungals to try to get rid of that infection?" Dr. Saddoughi asked her team.</p>



<p>But would it work? As they investigated, Dr. Saddoughi and her team found one other case reported in medical literature, but even that wasn't exactly the same. She says another question mark was connecting the new lungs to the trachea.</p>



<p>"When she had that initial transplant, her connection to the donor lung was at the level of the trachea. But for just a lung transplant, now you're doing the connection lower. And that was one of the surgical challenges or concerns that we had," says Dr. Saddoughi.</p>



<p>But the decision was made to go ahead. Britiny says she had mixed feelings.</p>



<p>"I was scared. Because the first time, I didn't know what to expect. And then this time was, I knew. But yeah, it was just scary — but exciting too," says Britiny.</p>



<p>In March of 2023, Britiny underwent her second double-lung transplant. At a recent follow-up appointment, Dr. Saddoughi shared that the lungs were working fine, and the infection was gone. She credits the way that different teams worked so well together.</p>



<p>"What's great about Mayo is that we have so much expertise in all the different areas, which is how we can do cases like this — so our lung transplant pulmonology team, our infectious diseases team, all the people that are working in the hospitals to really help us through the surgery and her postoperative and preoperative care. It's really critical for the success of our patients," says Dr. Saddoughi.</p>

<p>While the start of football season is still a few months away, Britiny says she has been tracking her teams. "I know what's going on all the time — let's just put it that way — even on offseason," she says.</p>



<p>She adds that she is looking forward to cheering her teams on, including her team at Mayo.</p>



<p>"I can't thank everyone enough — I mean nurses, doctors, everything," Britiny says.</p>

<p>Over 100,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891">organ transplant</a>. Unfortunately, many may never get the call saying that a suitable donor organ — and a second chance at life — has been found. It's estimated that more than 15 people die every day in the U.S. because of the lack of donor organs.</p>



<p>It can be hard to think about what's going to happen to your body after you die, let alone donating your organs and tissue. But being an organ donor is a generous, worthwhile decision that can be lifesaving.</p>



<p>If you've never considered organ donation or delayed becoming a donor because of something you've heard, here are answers to some common organ donation myths and concerns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: If I agree to donate my organs, the hospital staff won't work as hard to save my life.</h2>



<p>Fact: When you go to the hospital for treatment, healthcare professionals focus on saving your life — not somebody else's. You'll receive care from healthcare professionals whose expertise most closely matches your condition and who can give you the best care possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Maybe I won't really be dead when they sign my death certificate.</h2>



<p>Fact: Although it's a popular topic in the tabloids, in reality, people don't start to wiggle their toes after they're declared dead. People who have agreed to organ donation are given more tests to determine that they're truly dead than those who haven't agreed to organ donation. These extra tests are done at no charge to their families.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Organ donation is against my religion.</h2>



<p>Fact: Organ donation is consistent with the beliefs of most major religions. These religions include Roman Catholicism, Islam, most branches of Judaism and most Protestant faiths. If you're unsure of or uncomfortable with your faiths position on organ donation, ask your clergy member.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: I'm under 18. I'm too young to make this decision.</h2>



<p>Fact: Many states allow people younger than 18 to register as organ donors, but the final decision will remain the responsibility of your parents or legal guardian. Discuss your wish to become an organ donor with your family, and ask for their consent. Keep in mind that children need organ transplants, and they usually need organs smaller than those an adult can provide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: An open-casket funeral isn't an option for people who have donated organs or tissues.</h2>



<p>Fact: Organ and tissue donation doesn't interfere with having an open-casket funeral. The donor's body is clothed for burial and treated with care and respect, and there are no visible signs of organ or tissue donation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: I'm too old to donate. Nobody would want my organs.</h2>



<p>Fact: There's no defined cutoff age for donating organs. The decision to use your organs is based on strict medical criteria, not age. Don't prematurely disqualify yourself. Let the doctors decide at the time of your death whether your organs and tissues are suitable for transplantation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: I'm not in the best of health. Nobody would want my organs or tissues.</h2>



<p>Fact: Few medical conditions automatically disqualify you from donating organs. Again, the decision to use an organ is based on strict medical criteria. It may turn out that certain organs aren't able to be transplanted, but other organs and tissues may be fine. Don't prematurely disqualify yourself. Only medical professionals at the time of your death can determine whether your organs can be transplanted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: I'd like to donate one of my kidneys now, but I wouldn't be allowed to do that unless one of my family members is in need.</h2>



<p>Fact: While that used to be the case, it isn't any longer. Whether it's a distant family member, friend or stranger you want to help, you can donate a kidney through certain transplant centers as what is known as a living donor.</p>



<p>If you decide to become a living donor, you will undergo extensive questioning to ensure that you know the risks and that your decision to donate isn't based on financial gain. You also will undergo testing to determine if your kidneys are in good shape and whether you can live a healthy life with just one kidney.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Rich and famous people go to the top of the list when they need a donor organ.</h2>



<p>Fact: The rich and famous aren't given priority when it comes to allocating organs. It may seem that way because of the amount of publicity generated when a celebrity receives a transplant, but they are treated no differently than anyone else. In reality, celebrity and financial status are not considered in organ allocation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: My family will be charged if I donate my organs.</h2>



<p>Fact: The organ donor's family is never charged for donation. The family is charged for the costs of all final efforts to save your life, and those are sometimes misinterpreted as costs related to organ donation. Costs for organ recovery go to the transplant recipient.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Becoming an organ donor is easy. You can indicate that you want to be a donor in these ways:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Register with your state's donor registry.</strong><br>Most states have registries. Check the list at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.organdonor.gov/" target="_blank">organdonor.gov</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Designate your choice on your driver's license.</strong><br>Do this when you obtain or renew your license.</li>



<li><strong>Tell your family.</strong><br>Make sure your family knows your wishes regarding donation.</li>
</ul>



<p>The best way to ensure that your wishes are carried out is to register with your state's organ donation registry and include donor designation on your driver's license or state ID. Taking these steps legally authorizes your organ donation upon death.</p>



<p>If you have designated someone to make healthcare decisions for you if you become unable to do so, make sure that person knows that you want to be an organ donor. You also may include your wishes in your living will if you have one, but that paperwork might not be immediately available at the time of your death.</p>



<p>It's also important to tell your family you want to be a donor. Hospitals seek consent from the next of kin before removing organs, although this isn't required if you're registered with your state's donor registry or have donor designation on your driver's license or state ID card.</p>

<p>Every 10 minutes, someone is added to the national kidney transplant waiting list.</p>

<p>"A living kidney donor chain is when someone altruistically donates a kidney, meaning donates a kidney with not a specific individual in mind, that can start a chain effect of donors," explains Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>A donor chain also can be initiated when a good Samaritan donates on behalf of a friend or family member, but unfortunately, they're not a direct match for the recipient. The incompatible donor then donates their kidney to another person who is a match, while the original recipient gets a kidney from another compatible donor in the chain.</p>



<p>"There's no limit on the chain reaction. There have been chains of two, four, eight, sometimes even more," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>It's a gift that keeps on giving. Living donor chains expand the donor pool, helping more people in need of a kidney transplant.</p>



<p>Potential donors undergo an extensive screening process before donating.

<p>Their pioneering research focuses on using CAR-T cells derived from the patient's own immune system to prevent rejection of donated organs.

<p>"This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of using an immunotherapy that would remove B cells that cause sensitization in patients waiting for a kidney transplant," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/jarmi-tambi-m-d/bio-20536410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tambi Jarmi, M.D.</a>, first author on the study and a transplant nephrologist at Mayo Clinic in Florida. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"This research is one of the first steps toward applying CAR-T cells in the field of transplantation to try to make more donor organs available for transplant and reduce the wait for patients who need a new kidney."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Research on CAR-T cell therapy and transplantation</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers in the lab of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, developed a new type of CAR-T cell therapy that targets a protein known as B cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R), which is present on B cells. B cells play a key role in regulating the immune system and generating antibodies. They investigated whether the BAFF-R CAR-T cells could target and remove B cells that cause sensitization.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Qin-WF826186_0009-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385174" style="width:260px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Qin-WF826186_0009-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Qin-WF826186_0009-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Qin-WF826186_0009.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>For this study, researchers generated BAFF-R CAR-T cells from 10 patients considered sensitized to organ transplantation. Nine of them had undergone kidney transplants and one had received a lung transplant.</p>



<p>"We isolated T cells from a small quantity of the patient's blood. These CAR-T cells were then engineered to identify and neutralize B cells carrying a specific antigen, effectively targeting and eliminating the sensitizing cells," says Dr. Qin, lead author on the study, who is an immunologist and CAR-T cell researcher.</p>



<p>Then, the research team compared the activity of BAFF-R CAR-T cells to T cells after they were treated with B cells from healthy donors. Researchers saw a reduction in B cells from the sensitized patient group that had been treated with patient-derived CAR-T cells when compared to the non-CAR-T control group.</p>



<p>"Our study demonstrated that BAFF-R CAR-T cells derived from sensitized patients exhibited killing effects against B cells, which substantiates the viability of using BAFF-R CAR-T cell therapy as a desensitization strategy in kidney transplant," says Dr. Jarmi.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic now is preparing to biomanufacture the BAFF CAR-T cells at its commercial-grade facilities in Florida for testing in early-stage clinical trials.</p>



<p>The use of BAFF-R CAR-T cell therapy to desensitize kidney transplant patients is considered experimental. It is among the first investigations into the use of this immunotherapy for diseases beyond cancer. This research is a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20404319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Regenerative Immunotherapy and CAR-T Translational Research Program</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Department of Transplant Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hematology-oncology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology</a>.</p>



<p>Additional research is needed to validate the findings of this study. See <a href="https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(24)00159-5/fulltext">the paper</a> for a complete list of authors and their disclosures.</p>

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/">Mayo Clinic</a> and <a href="https://terasaki.org/institute/">Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation</a> announced today a research collaboration centered on improving organ transplant outcomes.</p>



<p>Beginning in April, Mayo Clinic biomedical researchers and Terasaki Institute scientists will work together on two core areas: real-time monitoring of donated organ health from procurement to transplant surgery and developing predictive technologies to determine which transplant recipients have a higher likelihood of rejection. That will be done by creating prognostic signatures and assays for antibody-mediated rejection of organ transplant. These initial projects are expected to take 24 to 30 months to complete.</p>



<p>"As the largest organ transplant provider in the United States, Mayo Clinic is deeply invested in finding innovative solutions to improve transplant care for patients. That is why we are so excited about this new collaboration with the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935">Burcin Taner, M.D.,</a> chair of the Transplant Center at Mayo Clinic in Florida and chair of Mayo Clinic Transplant Specialty Council. "Bringing these two institutions together with the same goal of improving transplant outcomes for patients will positively affect many lives."</p>

<p>"We are also very excited about our collaboration with Mayo Clinic," says Ali Khademhosseini, Ph.D., director and CEO of the Terasaki Institute of Biomedical Innovation. "We’re looking forward to conducting impactful research to enhance the quality of life for transplant patients, and we are happy to build upon the work of Dr. Paul I. Terasaki, a pioneer in the field of organ transplantation, who founded the original Terasaki Institute."&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 103,000 people in the U.S. are on the waiting list for an organ transplant. <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics">Every eight minutes</a>, another person is added to the transplant waiting list.</p>



<p>This latest collaboration is part of Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/transforming-transplant-initiative-aspires-to-save-lives-through-bioengineering/">Transforming Transplant initiative</a>, which has the bold goal of providing organ transplants for everyone who needs one. The initiative was created as a collaboration between Mayo Clinic's Transplantation programs and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about">Mayo Clinic's Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>. Its goals include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Restoring donated organs by optimizing them for best outcomes and decreasing discard rates.</li>



<li>Preventing organ failure in patients who have received organ transplants.</li>



<li>Preventing organ failure and the need for a transplant through early diagnosis of organ dysfunction.</li>



<li>Engineering new organs, subsequently eliminating the uncertainty of organ donation and long waits.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a>, with locations in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota, has performed more than 32,000 organ transplants since 1963.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new drug has been shown to increase healing and regeneration of the liver after major surgery, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867424002253?via%3Dihub">study published in the scientific journal Cell</a>. Researchers hope that this could lead to more surgical options for patients diagnosed with advanced liver tumors and liver failure.</p>



<p>"This research is significant because this is the first drug of its kind to show an increase in healing and regeneration of the liver after major surgery," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/nyberg-scott-l-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Nyberg, M.D., Ph.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon and co-senior author of the study. "This discovery has the potential to improve the treatment of liver failure, increase the safety of liver transplantation for living donors and potentially avoid the need for a liver transplant in some cases."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers collaborated with researchers at <a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tubingen University Hospital</a> in Germany, who led the <a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum/pressemeldungen/628?press_str=">project</a>. "Our drug candidate would not only be an urgently needed treatment option in oncological liver surgery but, by enabling safe living donor liver transplantations, also holds the promise to overcome the major problem of organ shortage in the field of liver transplantation," says Lars Zender, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author of the study from Tubingen.</p>



<p>Liver disease remains a major health concern, <a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(23)00194-0/fulltext#:~:text=Liver%20disease%20accounts%20for%20over,for%20600%2C000%20to%20900%2C000%20deaths." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">causing an estimated 2 million deaths</a> worldwide per year. While healthy livers have a nearly unlimited ability to regenerate themselves, that is not the case for livers that are damaged. As a result, surgeons treating a patient with primary liver tumors are limited in how large of a section of the liver can safely be removed to avoid liver failure.</p>



<p>The study found that a drug called HRX215 inhibits the MKK4 protein found in liver cells. That appears to trigger the self-healing function of the liver, allowing it to regenerate. Before the drug was tested in 48 healthy volunteers within the phase 1 study, it was investigated in animal models. The preclinical study was able to show that the use of HRX-215 increased liver regeneration and prevented liver failure, even after the removal of 85% of the organ. The phase 1 study found excellent safety and tolerability of the drug in people. Additional clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of the drug in humans.</p>



<p>Researchers are hopeful that this discovery will one day create more surgical options for patients with advanced liver tumors by allowing more of the liver to be safely removed. It also has the potential to benefit patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-liver-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20352863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute and chronic liver failure.</a> This drug could potentially allow for successful <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/care-at-mayo-clinic/pcc-20384845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplants</a> from a smaller portion of a healthy donor's liver, and thus posing less risk to healthy donors. Often, this liver is too small to successfully take over the function of the full-sized liver removed from the recipient. The hope would be that this drug could allow for rapid liver regeneration, creating a new safe transplant option for people struggling with liver failure. This drug also could potentially eliminate the need for a liver transplant for some patients.</p>
