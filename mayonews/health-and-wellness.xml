<p>The <a href="https://www.aap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> recommends infants be exclusively&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/breastfeeding-101-tips-for-new-moms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breastfed or given only breast milk</a>&nbsp;only for the first six months of life. The group also recommends that continuing breastfeeding as solid foods are introduced, up to and beyond the child's first year or as long as the mother and child desire. Many people desire to exclusively breastfeed their child for six months and plan to continue to breastfeed for one year or more.</p>



<p>Breast pain is the most frequently stated reason for early weaning. The longer a person experiences breast pain, the more likely they will wean the baby before they intend to. Immediate intervention and treatment of breast pain is crucial to preserving the breastfeeding relationship, and helping the person and their child continue breastfeeding.</p>



<p>Plugged ducts and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mastitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20374829" target="_blank">mastitis</a>&nbsp;are common conditions that can affect up to 1 in 5 people who begin breastfeeding. Both conditions cause pain and discomfort in the breast, which can affect long-term breast milk feeding goals. A plugged duct obstructs milk flow in a portion of the breast, either at the nipple or further back in the ductal system. Mastitis is inflammation and infection of the breast. These conditions happen most often in the first six to eight weeks postpartum, but they can occur at any time during breastfeeding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risk factors for plugged ducts, mastitis</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/too-embarrassed-to-ask-i-just-had-a-baby-whats-wrong-with-my-moods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stress</a>, fatigue, anemia and a weakened immune system are risk factors for plugged ducts and mastitis.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Additional risk factors for plugged ducts include:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Inadequate breast emptying</strong><br>This could be caused by a poor latch or nipple pain, or a baby who is sleepy, tongue-tied or uncoordinated with suck and swallow.</li>



<li><strong>Limited time during feedings</strong><br>This could occur if feedings are rushed or if the person is breastfeeding multiple babies.</li>



<li><strong>Missed feedings</strong><br>Plugged ducts are possible when there is a longer interval between breast emptying when the baby starts sleeping for longer periods, an abrupt weaning or overuse of a pacifier.</li>



<li><strong>Pressure on the breast</strong><br>This could include pressure from fingers during feedings, tight clothing around or on the breast, underwire bras, or pressure from carrying purse or diaper bag, car seat or baby carrier.</li>
</ul>



<p>Mastitis can be caused by any of these risk factors, in addition to having sore cracked or bleeding nipples, which can serve as an entry point for an infection and possibly lead to a prolonged hospital stay. People with a history of plugged ducts or mastitis also are at an increased risk for a future infection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of plugged ducts, mastitis</h2>



<p>Plugged ducts and mastitis can be uncomfortable for people who are breastfeeding. Plugged duct symptoms progress gradually, and can include pain, a hard lump, a warm and painful localized spot or a wedge-shaped area of engorgement on the breast. Mastitis symptoms appear rapidly and include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue and body aches. The pain typically is more intense than a plugged duct, and the person also may notice red streaking on the breasts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention of plugged ducts, mastitis</h2>



<p>You may have heard the saying "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." That is true for breast pain caused by plugged ducts or mastitis.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To get your breastfeeding relationship with your infant off to its best start — and avoid complications such as mastitis — keep these tips in mind:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Breastfeed in different positions to allow for more thorough emptying of the breast.</li>



<li>Create a frequent feeding schedule and empty each breast completely. With a newborn, this could be eight to 12 feedings in 24 hours.</li>



<li>Establish a good latch at every feeding to empty the breast better and prevent damaging the nipple.</li>



<li>Use high-quality pure lanolin or lanolin ointment for sore, cracked or bleeding nipples.</li>



<li>Wear a well-fitting nursing bra, and avoid underwire bras or tight straps from clothing, bags, purses or infant carriers.</li>
</ul>



<p>It also may be helpful to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/breast-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meet with a lactation consultant</a>&nbsp;who can provide additional tips and advice on proper breastfeeding techniques.</p>



<p>People with frequent plugged ducts may see improvement by taking a supplement called lecithin, which can reduce the "stickiness" of the milk and prevent plugged ducts from occurring. In addition, new research has found that taking probiotics can prevent and decrease the incidence of mastitis and is safe during breastfeeding. Look for a probiotic that contains Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus salivarius.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment for plugged ducts, mastitis</h2>



<p>Treating a plugged duct immediately and aggressively is essential to prevent further progression, reduce pain and eliminate frustration.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment includes:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Eating a well-balanced, healthy diet.</li>



<li>Fully emptying the breast during each feeding through frequent feeding, hand expression, or pumping or feeding in different positions.</li>



<li>Heat can be applied to the breast before feeding to better empty the breast. To apply heat, fill a disposable diaper with warm water, squeeze out the excess water and place it on the breast.</li>



<li>Increasing fluid consumption.</li>



<li>Massage, emptying breasts often by hand expression, frequent feeding, and pumping and feeding in different positions to thoroughly empty breasts.</li>



<li>Rest.</li>



<li>Therapeutic breast massage taught by a certified lactation consultant.</li>
</ul>



<p>A healthcare professional may prescribe antibiotics if a person has mastitis, is acutely ill and the symptoms are persisting or worsening. Breastfeeding and expressed breast milk feeding are safe and recommended, even with antibiotic therapy.</p>



<p>It's safe to continue breastfeeding if you have mastitis or a plugged duct. Breastfeeding helps clear the infection or ductal system. Weaning your baby abruptly is likely to worsen your signs and symptoms.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric surgery</a> is more than just surgery. It's a lifestyle change that includes a lifelong <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/establishing-healthy-behaviors-that-stick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to eating healthy</a> with your dietitian's guidance and incorporating <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-5-elements-of-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regular exercise</a> into your routine.</p>



<p>After bariatric surgery, patients who regularly exercise for 60 minutes six days a week lose weight more quickly and dramatically improve their capacity for exercise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take advantage of peak weight-loss period</h2>



<p>The time to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/doctors-orders/need-to-exercise-start-slowly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">establish your exercise habits</a> is before you have the surgery. Then solidify that routine during the first year after surgery, which is when people typically find it easiest to lose weight.</p>



<p>After bariatric surgery, your body may try to hold onto its fat stores until its other energy sources are depleted. This can lead to the loss of muscle mass after surgery. To minimize or prevent the body from using muscle mass for energy, it's crucial to work your muscles regularly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some of the benefits of cardio, strength and endurance training are:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Improved heart condition, balance, stability and mood</li>



<li>Increased energy, lean muscle mass and bone density</li>



<li>Reduced body fat, risk of injury and stress</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Amp up, change your exercise routine</h2>



<p>When people lose weight, their energy expenditure — the number of calories the body burns — is reduced both at rest and during exercise. This means that when you lose weight, but continue the same exercise routine, you burn fewer calories than before you lost weight.</p>



<p>In addition, regular exercise increases your capacity and ability to work harder. As you become better conditioned, your workout will feel easier than when you first began. This is an indication that it's time to increase the exercise intensity.</p>



<p>You want to aim for a level of cardiorespiratory exercise that's somewhat difficult for you. One test of intensity is if you can talk in breathy sentences as you exercise. If you can't speak, scale back until you can.</p>



<p>Consider changing your exercise routine by <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/prevent-boredom-and-injury-during-physical-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying something new</a>. If you feel comfortable with your treadmill workout, try switching to another piece of equipment, such as an elliptical or cycle. Or take a class such as low-impact aerobics, spinning, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/aquatic-exercise-healthy-easy-on-the-body" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water fitness</a> or aerobic dance.</p>



<p>These tweaks to your routine can challenge your body in new ways and help maintain your interest in exercising. Workout variety also plays a significant role five to six months after bariatric surgery, when many patients experience a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/why-has-my-weight-plateaued-when-i-have-50-more-pounds-to-lose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss plateau</a>. Changing your exercise routine can minimize or even eliminate a plateau.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Increase exercise intensity, time, frequency</h2>



<p>As your fitness improves, you'll be able to increase the intensity, time or frequency of your exercise routine. One way to do that is through <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/interval-training-for-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-intensity interval training (HIIT)</a>. As with any new form of exercise, check with your healthcare team to make sure HIIT is a good fit for you.</p>



<p>A HIIT workout alternates between short intense bursts of exercise and active recovery, which is like a "breather" with less intense exercise. Research shows that HIIT workouts are more effective for heart health, fat loss and strength gain than traditional cardio and strength training. HIIT can be incorporated into nearly any exercise from running to water fitness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pay attention to strength training</h2>



<p>As you plan your routine, focus on <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/no-matter-your-age-or-skill-level-its-never-too-late-to-start-weight-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">muscle-strengthening exercises</a> at least three days a week, which will also improve your bone density and metabolism. Muscle burns calories even at rest, so if you increase your muscle mass, you will burn more calories throughout the day.</p>



<p>You can build muscle strength using weight machines, resistance bands, free weights and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/isometric-exercise-and-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your own body weight</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new lifestyle, not a chore</h2>



<p>You've undergone bariatric surgery not only to lose weight but also to improve your health. Reaching your goals requires changing your lifestyle, and exercise is essential to that success. Becoming a regular exerciser can be empowering, fun and open doors to meeting new people and broadening your interests.</p>



<p>To keep exercise from becoming a chore, find what you like to do, but switch it up to add variety and challenge your body in different ways. Cardio and strength training are both key to a successful exercise and weight-loss routine.</p>

<p>Added sugar in foods not only adds extra calories, it also can have direct toxic effects, such as tooth decay and even a risk for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>. Minimizing the amount of added sugar in your diet is important. However, you may not even realize how much added sugar you consume. That's because some unsuspecting foods you may think are healthy contain added sugar.</p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hensrud-donald-d-m-d-m-s/bio-20053543" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Donald Hensrud</a>, a Mayo Clinic physician specializing in nutrition and the editor of "<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/mayo-clinic-diet/art-20045460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mayo Clinic Diet</a>," explains what to look out for when trying to avoid added sugar.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (0:55) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/SCRIPT-MCM-Added-Sugar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"Anytime food is processed, there are certain things that are added. And it's often sugar or salt," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>When trying to identify how much added sugar is in packaged food, look at the nutrition food label. You might be surprised by what you find.</p>



<p>"Many things you wouldn't even suspect — some sauces, some dips, some spreads — there’s added sugars in almost every category of food products out there," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>Foods that can be surprising sources of added sugar:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Salad dressing</li>



<li>Condiments</li>



<li>Canned soup</li>



<li>Granola bars</li>



<li>Protein bars</li>
</ul>



<p>"It's been shown that, in many people, the amount of calories they get from added sugars is quite significant," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>Dr. Hensrud suggests paying close attention to food labels and trying to consume foods that contain natural sugars, like fruits, which are low in calories and contain vitamins and minerals.</p>

<p>In this season of packing up for college, here's a warning about packing on the "freshman 15." </p>



<p>"It's usually not actually 15 (pounds). It's more often 7 or 8," says Dr. Millstone.</p>



<p>Still, it's extra weight that Dr. Millstine says is often caused by a change in activity and eating habits from high school to college.  </p>



<p>"If you're going to be eating at a cafeteria or eating out more, stop and think: How am I going to manage this?" she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Millstine offers four daily goals for every freshman. No. 1: Eat plants. </p>



<p>"Ideally, at least five fruits and vegetables every day," says Dr. Millstine. </p>



<p>No. 2: Don't drink a lot of calories. </p>



<p>"If you're going to class and you're grabbing a coffee drink or a smoothie, it can have a lot of calories in it," explains Dr. Millstine. "Same thing with energy drinks." </p>



<p>No. 3: Find ways to move.  </p>



<p>"Take the stairs instead of the elevator," she explains. "Always make sure you're walking to class."</p>



<p>And No. 4: Get decent sleep. </p>



<p>"Really trying to get that seven to nine hours of sleep consistently, whatever your body requires, can help you to manage your weight." Dr. Millstine concludes.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My kids and I love to go hiking when the weather is nice, but I've heard ticks are terrible this year. What are the risks? How can I keep us safe and still stay active outside?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Warm weather entices you into the great outdoors. But while you're having fun golfing, camping, picnicking and hiking, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alpha-gal-syndrome/in-depth/tick-species/art-20546861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ticks</a> are looking for a ride — and a meal. Ticks live in woods, fields and grassy areas. All of them survive on blood drawn from people or animals, and they can pass along disease in the process.</p>



<p>To find their next meal, ticks climb onto objects like blades of grass, leaves or shrubs and stick out their legs. When a host brushes by, they grab on. Some ticks attach quickly, while others wander, looking for places where the skin is thinner, like the ear. Ticks also like warm and dark areas, such as the armpit, behind the knee, along the scalp and in the belly button. That's where they'll grab hold and bite.</p>



<p>While attached to a host, ticks can acquire or pass along disease. After feeding, most drop off. At their next feeding, ticks can transmit an acquired disease to the new host.</p>



<p>Ticks are found in most regions of the country. Tick-borne diseases and regions in the U.S. they're common include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lyme disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ehrlichiosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anaplasmosis</a>, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/babesiosis-and-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-2023-tick-season/">babesiosis</a> and Borrelia miyamotoi disease: Upper Midwest and the Northeast</li>



<li>Ehrlichiosis: Southeast and South Central</li>



<li>Rocky Mountain spotted fever: North Carolina, South Central and Southwest</li>



<li>Relapsing fever: Great Plains, Mountain West and West Coast</li>



<li>Southern tick-associated rash illness, or Lone Star tick disease: East, Southeast and South Central, but spreading north</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Not every tick carries disease, but it's still a good idea to avoid being bitten. These tips can help:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When outdoor activities take you into tick territory, wear shoes (not sandals), long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, hat and gloves.</li>



<li>Stick to trails when possible, and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass.</li>



<li>Keep dogs leashed so they don't venture where ticks may be.</li>



<li>Use insect repellents with at least 20% DEET. Repellents with up to 30% DEET can be applied to children over 2 months old but used sparingly on children under 2. Apply to clothes and exposed skin but not hands.</li>
</ul>



<p>The concentration of DEET in a repellent determines how long protection lasts. A concentration of 10% provides two hours of protection; 30% gives five hours. Avoid products that combine sunscreen and DEET because <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/sunscreen-agent-topical-application-route/proper-use/drg-20070255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunscreen</a> needs to be applied more frequently than DEET.</p>



<p>After spending time in a wooded or grassy area, check yourself, as well as your children and pets, for ticks. Deer ticks, which carry Lyme disease, often are no bigger than the head of a pin, so search carefully.</p>



<p>Shower as soon as you come indoors. Using a washcloth on your skin can dislodge ticks that haven't attached yet. You also can put your clothes in the dryer for 10 minutes on high heat to kill lingering ticks.</p>



<p>If a tick has attached, time is key. The longer it hangs on, the greater your risk of getting tick-borne diseases.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To remove a tick:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Avoid folklore remedies like painting the tick with nail polish or petroleum jelly, or using heat from a match or lighter to release its hold.</li>



<li>Use fine-tipped tweezers to grab the tick firmly near its head or mouth and as close to the skin as possible.</li>



<li>Pull the tick's body up and away from your skin. Avoid jerking or twisting.</li>



<li>Take a photo of the tick so your healthcare professional can identify it. Dispose of the tick by putting it in alcohol or a sealed bag, wrapping it tightly in tape or flushing it down the toilet.</li>



<li>After handling the tick, use soap and water to wash your hands and the area around the tick bite.</li>
</ul>



<p>A small, red bump often appears at the site of a tick bite and resolves after a few days. This is typical and doesn't indicate that it has transmitted a disease to that person.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Contact your healthcare professional if:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>You aren't able to completely remove the tick.</strong></li>



<li><strong>The rash or bump gets bigger.</strong></li>



<li><strong>You develop flu-like signs and symptoms.</strong></li>



<li><strong>You think the bite site is infected.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Don't let worry over tick-borne diseases keep you and your family indoors. You can safely enjoy your favorite summer activities with a few precautions, like carefully checking for and removing ticks after spending time in wooded or grassy areas. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/katie-clubb-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Katie Clubb, M.D.</em></a><em><strong>, Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, </strong></em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/owatonna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Owatonna, Minnesota</em></a></p>

<p>When it comes to back pain, there's good news and bad news.</p>



<p>The good news is that back pain is rarely a sign of something serious and is often relatively short-lived. The bad news is that it's a common ailment for many adults. About 80% of adults experience pain in their back at some point in their lives.</p>



<p>Nearly 90% of back pain cases are temporary, and people make a full functional recovery within 12 weeks of the onset of their symptoms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What causes back pain?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some of the most common causes of back pain include:</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arthritis</a></h4>



<p>Lower back pain often is caused by osteoarthritis, or wear-and-tear arthritis, the most common type. Just as arthritis affects your knees, hips, wrists and shoulders, it also affects your spine. The spine has over 30 segments, each with four joints and discs, that can develop arthritis.</p>



<p>The joints in your back can swell and become larger, similar to the symptoms of arthritis in the knuckles of the hand. This inflammation and enlargement can lead to a narrowing of the space around the spinal cord or nerve roots, a condition called spinal stenosis.</p>



<p>Also, cartilage degenerates as you age, so bone-on-bone joint movement can cause pain with movement.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Bulging or ruptured disks</h4>



<p>Disks are the cushioning between the bones in your spine that absorb impact, similar to the suspension on your car or a mountain bike. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/herniated-disk/expert-answers/bulging-disk/faq-20058428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disks can bulge or rupture</a> and press on a nerve. Also, they can degenerate with time and lose the ability to provide cushion for average day-to-day impact, which can result in back pain.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Muscle or ligament strain</h4>



<p>Repeatedly lifting heavy objects or twisting your back quickly can <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscle-strains/symptoms-causes/syc-20450507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strain muscles</a> and spinal ligaments. Carrying extra weight can strain your back, leading to pain.</p>



<p>It's not always possible to pinpoint a reason for back pain. Back pain can sometimes be tracked to muscle strain from a fall or lifting something heavy. More commonly, people can't tie their pain to any specific activity or event.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When should you seek care for back pain?</h2>



<p>Rarely, back pain may be a sign of something serious.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">However, you should schedule an appointment with your healthcare team if you have pain that:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Accompanies unintended weight loss</li>



<li>Arises with swelling, redness on your back and fevers, which could indicate an infection</li>



<li>Causes weakness, numbness or tingling in one or both legs</li>



<li>Follows a fall, blow to your back or another injury</li>



<li>Happens during or after cancer treatment</li>



<li>Is constant or intense, especially at night or when you lie down</li>



<li>Occurs with new bowel or bladder control problems</li>



<li>Spreads down one or both legs, especially if the pain extends below your knee</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can you find relief from back pain?</h2>



<p>Although you may want to head to the couch when you're hurting, continued light activity and stretching can help in recovery.</p>



<p>Doing regular activities and even light exercise is all right unless the activity worsens the pain. Recovering from an injury means a gradual increase in activity. Listen to your body and try to keep moving.</p>



<p>Avoid actions that further stress your back, such as bending over to tie your shoes, twisting your entire body, bending from your waist or performing high-impact exercises.</p>



<p>Rest, applying heat to the affected areas and over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen, naproxen or acetaminophen, might be enough to ease the pain. If your pain isn't better after several weeks, you may need to see your healthcare professional for an evaluation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can back pain be prevented?</h2>



<p>The best way to avoid back pain is to prevent it by taking good care of your back.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Recommended activities include:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Exercise.</strong><br>Walking, swimming and other low-impact aerobic activities can strengthen your back.</li>



<li><strong>Build muscle strength and flexibility.</strong><br>Stretching your back and strengthening your back and core muscles can support and protect your back. Plank holds and push-ups are good ways to help build your core.</li>



<li><strong>Sit, stand and lift correctly.</strong><br>Avoid slouching and standing or sitting in one position for too long. When you need to lift something heavy, lift from your legs, not your back.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight.</strong><br>Carrying extra pounds strains back muscles.</li>



<li><strong>If you smoke, quit.</strong><br>Smoking reduces blood flow through the smaller blood vessels throughout your body and can reduce your body's ability to heal injuries.</li>
</ul>

<p>2024 marks a pivotal year for advancing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in healthcare, requiring multidisciplinary teamwork and scientific rigor to bring these innovations to patient care.</p>



<p>These key takeaways emerged from Mayo Clinic's AI Summit, "Generative and Multimodal AI — Potentials and Challenges," held recently in Rochester. Nearly 300 attendees from Mayo Clinic and other institutions gathered in person and virtually to discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying AI technology to healthcare.</p>

<p>"As we are entering the era of artificial intelligence, AI has great potential and is already playing a critical role in revolutionizing healthcare and biomedicine," said <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tao-cui-ph-d/bio-20563927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cui Tao, Ph.D.</a>, chair of Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://intranet.mayo.edu/charlie/research-dept-ai-informatics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics</a>, in her opening remarks. Dr. Tao is the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair of AI and Informatics.</p>



<p></p>



<div style="height:23px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>"Our role as a Research shield enables us to lead innovation and discovery efforts within the AI medicine ecosystem," adds Dr. Tao. "Through collaborative research, we aim to drive advancements to significantly enhance healthcare outcomes."</p>



<p>AI integrates text, radiology images, digital pathology slides, genomics and other sources of information to assist care teams in defining disease and making predictive analyses to support clinical decision-making. This "multimodal" AI supports healthcare teams, enhancing their ability to develop innovative solutions and improve patient care.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Developing models and bridging the AI translation gap</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/halamka-john-d-m-d-m-s/bio-20542748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Halamka, M.D.</a>, the Dwight and Dian Diercks President of Mayo Clinic Platform and Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President's Strategic Initiative Professor, was a keynote speaker. He emphasized the need for AI solutions to address global healthcare challenges over the next 20 years.</p>



<p>"Culturally, I think we have an imperative to build these new solutions," he said, noting lower birthrates, higher longevity and higher demand for healthcare in many nations. Automation and AI, he explained, can be part of those solutions, enabling healthcare that is more proactive, less costly, less invasive and more focused on wellness and cures.</p>



<p>To create solutions that benefit global populations, AI developers need access to curated, de-identified data with depth, breadth and heterogeneity, said Dr. Halamka.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic hosts the largest curated, de-identified dataset in the world, he said, representing 32.5 million patients and growing. Companies such as those participating in the Mayo Clinic Platform's Accelerator program can leverage this data within a secure cloud environment to develop AI models.</p>



<p>Once developed, these models must be validated, approved by regulatory bodies and implemented so that they are easy for clinicians to use.</p>



<p>"Handing a data model and an AI model to a physician is not going to get its use and impact. It has to be fully integrated into their workflow," Dr. Halamka said. "It needs to be just-in-time, there offering appropriate advice without additional effort."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting to patients more quickly</strong></h2>



<p>Other headline speakers were Shauna Overgaard, Ph.D., senior director of AI Strategy and Frameworks, and co-director of the AI Validation and Stewardship Research Program at Mayo Clinic; <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/about/departments-offices/ai-human-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thomas Fuchs, D.Sc.</a>, dean of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; <a href="https://winshipcancer.emory.edu/profiles/madabhushi-anant.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anant Madabhushi, Ph.D.</a>, executive director for the&nbsp;Emory University Empathetic AI for Health Institute; and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hoifung/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hoifung Poon</a>, general manager at Microsoft Health Futures.</p>



<p>In her keynote, Dr. Overgaard discussed the "AI translation gap" between proof of concept and clinical implementation. The estimated time for translating a basic science discovery to clinical practice is 17 years, she noted. "We know that as we work toward innovation, we absolutely cannot wait 17 years."</p>



<p>Translating AI solutions into patient care involves overcoming challenges such as gaining clinician trust, ensuring reliability through continuous scientific validation, securing payer approval, and meeting regulatory requirements. These efforts ensure that AI tools efficiently augment and enhance healthcare professionals' expertise and patient care practices.</p>



<p>"Part of our work is identifying potential barriers to AI translation and then working together to close those barriers as well as streamline innovation," she said. This will require scientific rigor and multidisciplinary teamwork. Dr. Overgaard said that a solid translational process should enable stakeholders by addressing transparency, reproducibility, ethics and effectiveness. The AI Summit was hosted by the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tizhoosh-hamid-r-ph-d/bio-20530617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hamid Tizhoosh, Ph.D.</a>, Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, served as chair of the AI Summit</p>

<p>For some people, migraines are debilitating. The intense, throbbing head pain is often so severe that it feels like the head will explode.</p>



<p>"When people have migraine, they typically do have pain, typically moderate or severe pain, but they have other symptoms that go along with that," says Dr. Halker Singh.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What triggers migraines?</h3>



<p>A migraine is a neurologic disease that affects people differently. Some migraine sufferers experience sensitivity to light, sound and smells.</p>



<p>"It can impact their quality of life. It can impact their day. They typically have attacks which can be unpredictable," Dr. Halker Singh explains.</p>



<p>Extreme weather can affect various changes in the brain and cause a migraine.</p>



<p>"Many people say that barometric pressure changes and changes in the weather, but some people say it's the heat that triggers them," says Dr. Halker Singh.</p>



<p>It's crucial for migraine sufferers to stick to a routine and get plenty of exercise and rest.&nbsp; Also, it's important to stay hydrated during the summer.</p>



<p>"We really need to be careful about maintaining as much hydration as we can. And I think sometimes we don't even realize we're dehydrated. It just happens," she says.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parvovirus-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20376085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parvovirus B19</a> is the cause of Fifth disease, a mild rash typically seen in children, although adults can contract the virus. Parvovirus B19 affects only humans. You can't contract it or transmit it to dogs or cats. However, different parvoviruses can affect pets.</p>



<p>"Fifth disease is a relatively common infection in childhood," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rajapakse-nipunie-s-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20308514?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse,</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;pediatric infectious diseases physician with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's Center</a>. "It has a few names. It's caused by a virus called parvovirus B19."</p>



<p>&nbsp;For most children, symptoms are mild.</p>



<p>"The most common symptoms that children will usually have with this infection are fever, maybe some runny nose and then a characteristic rash that usually turns their cheeks bright red, and then they may develop a more kind of lacy-looking rash on their extremities and trunk," she says.</p>

<p>Adults infected with parvovirus 19 may have different symptoms than children.</p>



<p>Joint pain or swelling is less common but more frequent in adults. The virus also can temporarily stop the body from making new red blood cells, leading to anemia. People with sickle cell disease and weakened immune systems are at higher risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Rajapakse says parvovirus B19 spreads through respiratory secretions, such as contact with droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The virus can spread through blood and from a pregnant woman to her child. If a pregnant person suspects exposure to parvovirus B19, they should tell their healthcare team as soon as possible due to potential rare fetal complications if the mother lacks immunity.</p>



<p>"Parvovirus B19 is a viral infection that is quite common in childhood. If you test them, most adults show signs that they had this infection when they were a child," says Dr. Rajapakse. "The rash usually isn't causing too many symptoms, so it doesn't need any specific treatment. And as the child's body fights off the virus, the rash usually resolves along with that."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h3>



<p>There are no vaccines or medications to prevent infection, but there are ways to reduce your chances of getting infected or transmitting the infection to others.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>



<li>&nbsp;Practice good hand hygiene by covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing.</li>



<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>



<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>



<li>Stay home and avoid others when you are sick.</li>
</ul>



<p>Parvovirus B19 affects only humans. You can't contract it or transmit it to dogs or cats. However, different parvoviruses can affect pets.</p>



<p>Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, got its name from being the fifth in a list of childhood illnesses known for causing a rash,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parvovirusb19/fifth-disease.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a>&nbsp;to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>



<p>In the U.S., the virus peaks in winter and spring. The CDC reports mini outbreaks every three to four years.</p>
