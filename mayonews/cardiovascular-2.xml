<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I have read that heart attacks are more common around the holidays. Why does that happen? Is there anything I can do to lower my risk? I currently take blood pressure medication, and heart disease runs in my family.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Heart attacks, along with heart problems in general, are more common around the holidays. Various factors can play into this, including stress, travel, disrupted schedules, changes in diet and even environmental factors. Fortunately, many self-care steps can help you keep your heart healthy.</p>



<p>One of the biggest challenges this time of year is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20046702?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy eating</a>. For people with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular health</a> problems, choosing a heart-healthy diet amid an abundance of holiday foods can be daunting. But not straying too far from your normal diet is important.</p>



<p>Keep portion sizes reasonable and limit fatty foods. Eating too much can lead to chest pain or shortness of breath in some people with heart problems. Drink small amounts of alcohol, if any, as alcohol can raise your risk for heart rhythm problems and heart attack. Men should not drink more than two alcoholic beverages a day. Women should not have more than one.</p>



<p>Watch the amount of salt, or sodium, you consume. If your heart pumping function is reduced or if you have heart failure, your ability to manage fluid and to process salt is diminished. To limit fluid retention in such cases, a low-salt diet often is recommended. Controlling salt can be hard, however, when you eat out or dine at someone else’s home. Ask the cook if he or she might limit the amount of salt added. Find out which foods are lower in salt. Limit canned and prepared foods, along with gravies and sauces, as they tend to be very high in sodium.</p>



<p>Travel and schedule changes also can be barriers to heart health during the holidays. Staying on schedule with your medications can be challenging when you switch time zones or when you are away from your daily routines. But taking your medication as prescribed is critical. Set up reminders to yourself or ask someone to help keep you on track. If you are planning to travel to another time zone, ask your pharmacist if medication schedule changes are necessary.</p>



<p>Winter weather also may increase the use of wood burning stoves and fireplaces, but it is important to have proper ventilation. There is a fair amount of data that indicates increased exposure to certain pollutants and particulate matter can increase the risk of both heart and pulmonary issues. Older individuals or those with existing cardiac conditions should consider dressing in layers and limit time they are exposed to wood smoke. As much as possible, continue the self-care you do at home. For example, if you weigh yourself every day to help maintain your fluid balance, find a scale where you can do that. If a walk is part of your routine, invite your family to go with you and enjoy some company along with the exercise.</p>



<p>Finally, it is important to keep stress in check. Increased <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/basics/stress-basics/hlv-20049495?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress</a> can raise a person’s risk for a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>. We think of the holiday season as a happy time, but that isn’t always reality. For some people, the holidays can be sad and stressful. If that is your situation, try to give yourself a break. Plan and do what is reasonable. If you have feelings of sadness or depression that last more than two weeks, see your health care professional.</p>



<p>If you start to feel sick, seek help. Don’t ignore symptoms because you feel badly about disrupting a holiday gathering. Tell someone right away if you notice new or changing chest discomfort, especially if it radiates to your back or to your arm, neck or jaw. Other symptoms of heart problems include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/definition/sym-20050890?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a>, feeling clammy or light-headed, an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350674?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">irregular heartbeat</a>, and swelling in your legs. Getting medical help is particularly critical if these symptoms last or if they don’t improve after taking your usual medications.</p>



<p>The holidays are a high-risk time for heart problems, especially in people who have existing heart conditions. Pay attention to your body. As much as possible, stick to a heart-healthy lifestyle. And, above all, if you have symptoms of heart problems, ask for help right away. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hayes-sharonne-n-m-d/bio-20053532?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Dr. Sharonne Hayes</strong></em></a><strong><em>, Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>"The health risks of loneliness, they can be just as high as the health risks of obesity, of smoking, of physical inactivity, of excessive alcohol consumption," says Dr. Shah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that can lead to increased risks of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/in-depth/heart-attack-symptoms/art-20047744?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depression</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20360803?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/suicide/in-depth/suicide/art-20048230?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suicide</a>.</p>

It is actually something that we know, that chronic loneliness especially can really impact the health of people," Dr. Shah says.</p>



<p>While loneliness and social isolation are found in all age groups, people over 60 are the most affected. And it can compound other health issues. For instance, Dr. Shah says, "If you've fallen and you're socially isolated, how does anyone know that you were down with a hip fracture if no one's ever been checking in on you or you're socially isolated?"</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Addressing loneliness and social isolation&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There are many ways to address these issues — and that includes looking at sensory deprivation. For example, hearing loss can cause withdrawal when understanding conversations becomes difficult.</p>

<p>Simple outreach to others can be a step towards better overall health.&nbsp;Dr. Shah says social media is a great tool to find like-minded people, but if it's not creating&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-benefits-of-being-socially-connected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real connections</a>, it can contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"To have just a basic human connection is an innate human need that we see from babies onwards. And that doesn't go away in the modern times," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>Dr. Shah says understanding why someone is feeling lonely or is socially isolated is important. Depression, for instance, can be treated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Stem cell-based therapy improved quality of life for patients with advanced <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers and international collaborators discovered in a late-stage multinational clinical trial. In one of the largest studies of cell intervention after a heart attack, patients reported their daily hardship lessened when stem cells optimized for heart repair supplemented standard of care. This clinical study further documented lower death and hospitalization rates among those treated with cell therapy. This research is published in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38006196/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stem Cells Translational Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>"In this era of global aging, people live longer, yet are at risk of chronic disease imposing a poor quality of life. Heart failure is an emerging epidemic in need of new healing options," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/terzic-andre-m-d-ph-d/bio-00084640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andre Terzic, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular researcher and lead author on the paper. "The stem cell-based approach in the present study demonstrates sustained benefit on physical and emotional health in response to biotherapy." Dr. Terzic is the Marriott Family Director, Comprehensive Cardiac Regenerative Medicine for the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Approximately 800,000 people in the U.S. suffer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attacks</a> every year. Damage to cardiac muscle weakens the heart's ability to pump blood through the body, leading to heart failure — a debilitating and life-threatening disease. People with heart failure often suffer a diminished quality of life associated with shortness of breath, fatigue, swollen legs and limited daily activities. Standard of care for heart failure includes a heart-healthy diet and habits, medications, implantable devices, and rehabilitation. However, current regimens do not work for everyone, especially in advanced disease stages.<br><br><strong>The research</strong></p>



<p>The study team recruited 315 patients from 39 hospitals in 10 countries who had advanced heart failure despite receiving standard of care. Patients were randomly divided into groups that would receive stem cell therapy versus those who would not. Patients assigned to cell treatment underwent cardiac catheterization. Then, stem cells taken from their own bone marrow and programmed to heal damaged heart tissue were delivered to the heart. Patients assigned not to receive stem cells had cardiac catheterization without cell delivery — known as the sham treatment.</p>



<p>All participants were asked to complete a 21-question self-assessment at the beginning of the study and then again at 26-, 39- and 52-weeks following treatment. For each question, they rated their physical, behavioral and emotional states on a scale of 0 to 5.</p>



<p>During the one-year follow-up, patients with preexisting left cardiac chamber enlargement consistently reported improved quality of life after cell therapy over those who received the sham treatment. In parallel, lower death and hospitalization rates were recorded among those who received stem cells.</p>



<p>"Data from one of the largest cardiovascular cell therapy trials, testing a regenerative technology discovered at Mayo Clinic, indicate benefit in both quantity and quality of life in advanced heart disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/yamada-satsuki-m-d-ph-d/bio-00028010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satsuki Yamada, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular researcher and first author on the study. "The benefit of regenerative care has been typically evaluated on the basis of clinician-reported outcomes. What's unique in this study is that it was designed to listen to the patient's experience."</p>



<p>This clinical trial was conducted in a double-blinded fashion, with both participants and their healthcare professionals masked during the study assignment. A double-blind study&nbsp;is designed to reduce the risk of bias when evaluating patient outcomes.</p>



<p>Further independent clinical studies are needed to validate the findings of this research.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Patients who received the anticoagulant drug <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/warfarin-oral-route/description/drg-20070945?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warfarin</a> after <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/aortic-valve-repair-aortic-valve-replacement/about/pac-20385093?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement</a> had lower incidence of mortality and a decreased risk of blood clots, according to a retrospective study published in <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00404-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>.</p>



<p>The use of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement has increased significantly during the past decade. Among its advantages is that most patients can avoid warfarin for anticoagulation treatment. Even so, research has been conflicting on whether patients would benefit from more aggressive early postoperative anticoagulation treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers analyzed nationwide data on more than 10,000 patients who underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. Warfarin use was associated with a 32% reduction in mortality risk. Patients treated with warfarin early postoperatively also had an increased risk of major bleeding events.</p>



<p>"The findings support early warfarin use in appropriately selected patients, such as patients with low bleeding risk," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/schaff-hartzell-v-m-d/bio-20053174?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hartzell Schaff, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular surgeon who contributed to the study. "There’s often reluctance to prescribe anticoagulant treatment early after surgery due to concerns about bleeding and uncertainty about benefits. Our research finds that the small increased hazard of bleeding (4% versus 2.3%) may be an acceptable risk given the benefits in terms of mortality risk as well as reduced risk of thromboembolism."</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic study analyzed deidentified patient data from 2007 to 2019 using OptumLabs Data Warehouse, which contains claims data of commercially insured and Medicare Advantage enrollees of all ages and races throughout the U.S. The study was conducted in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/about/overview">Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E.

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart failure is a potentially urgent health concern for young <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-congenital-heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355456?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adults with congenital heart disease</a> (ACHD) that is often overlooked and undertreated, even as hospitalizations for this condition continue to rise. New research from Mayo Clinic shows that young adults in the U.S. living with congenital heart disease are at an increased risk of death or cardiovascular complications after being hospitalized for heart failure. However, study data published in the <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Heart Association</a> also found that patients who had been receiving recent cardiology care before a heart failure hospitalization were less likely to die.</p>



<p>"More than 85% of children born with congenital heart disease reach adulthood. They are likely to experience complications later, yet 61% of these patients beyond the age of 18 do not see a cardiology specialist," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/medical-innovation/burchill-congenital-heart-disease?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke Burchill, M.B.B.S., Ph.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. "These young adult patients have a strong need for individualized care pathways to improve their quality of life and monitor health issues like heart failure."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.118.008775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prior research</a> showed that heart failure hospitalizations of U.S. adults with congenital heart disease increased dramatically from 1998 to 2011. To further understand this trend and its effect on patients and hospital resources, Dr. Burchill and colleagues used national data to study a retrospective cohort of adults with congenital heart disease hospitalized in the past decade. The percentage of ACHD heart failure hospitalizations increased significantly, rising from 6.6% in 2010 to 14% in 2020.</p>



<p>In more than 26,000 unique hospital admissions of ACHD patients, 22% had heart failure and 78% did not. Those admitted with heart failure had a higher risk of death and other major heart and brain complications and used more healthcare resources, including rehospitalization and post-acute care services than those admitted without heart failure. However, people who had a cardiology clinic visit within 30 days prior to hospital admission had lower rates of death due to any causes at the 90-day and 1-year mark.</p>



<p>The ACHD patients with heart failure were nearly twice as likely as those without heart failure to be readmitted to a hospital, especially those under age 45, regardless of their type of congenital heart disease. Younger patients also required more medical or supportive care after they left the hospital before they could return home and care for themselves.</p>



<p>"Many of the patients I meet with ACHD and heart failure share a similar story of not having their heart-related symptoms taken seriously, leading to a delayed recognition and treatment of heart failure. The good news is that we can reset the course for most," says Dr. Burchill. "We have new medications to restrengthen the heart, new options for replacing heart valves without opening the chest, and low-risk treatments for returning heart rhythm to normal. Our goal is to shift the focus from heart failure to heart function and patient success in feeling better and living longer."</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic doctors are using innovation to improve the lives of people who suffer from congestive heart failure and other chronic heart conditions. The Organ Care System, also known as "heart in a box,” is potentially helping to expand the donor pool, which is crucial, considering that more than 4,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for a new heart. That’s according to the organization <a href="https://donatelife.net/donation/organs/heart-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donate Life America.</a></p>

<p>Every single hour, minute and second counts as the transplant team races against the clock to provide organ recipients with a lifesaving gift.</p>



<p>"In this country, there are not enough hearts to meet the needs of all of the patients who could potentially qualify for a heart transplant," says Dr. LeMond.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Technology is improving methods of preserving and transporting donor hearts</h3>



<p>Innovation is improving transplant surgeries. Typically, donor hearts are retrieved from a person who is declared brain-dead but whose heart is still beating. With the relatively new system, heart in a box, doctors can revive the donated heart by perfusing the organ with warm, oxygenated blood.</p>



<p>"We now have new technology that allows us to place the donor hearts into a special machine which delivers blood and controls the temperature to the heart to allow it to start beating," explains Dr. LeMond.</p>



<p>The perfusion system can preserve the donated heart for up to 12 hours. Before this technology, the donor heart would be on ice in a cooler to preserve it during transport, and doctors only had about four hours to get the heart to the recipient. So far this year (as of Nov. 20), the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center </a>has performed 156 heart transplants across all Mayo Clinic campuses.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Heart transplants are performed in patients with:</h3>



<ul>
<li>A weakening of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).</li>



<li>Coronary artery disease.</li>



<li>Heart valve disease.</li>



<li>Congenital heart defect.</li>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers studying the genetics of people who had recently developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dilated-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20353149">dila</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dilated-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20353149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dilated-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20353149">ed cardiomyopathy</a>, one of the most common causes of heart failure, have found a particular gene to target for developing future drug therapy treatments. The disease makes it harder for the heart's left ventricle to pump blood effectively to the rest of the body. In this first genome-wide association&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37800334/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, the researchers sought to understand why some patients get better after developing the condition — and some don't.</p>



<p>"We found genetic variation in the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene, a gene that no one has heard of in cardiology, and its link to improvement in heart function in these patients," says lead author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/pereira-naveen-l-m-d/bio-20055103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, who studies genetic variation and its implications in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease, specifically heart failure.</p>



<p>Genetic variation in the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene can lead to differences in the protein's structure, potentially influencing a person's susceptibility to various diseases or their response to specific therapies.</p>



<p>The researchers identified and examined the role of the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene because of this gene's link to improving the heart's left ventricle to pump blood effectively in people with dilated cardiomyopathy. The&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene is often variably expressed in fibroblasts (connective tissue) of people with this condition. In addition, fibrosis (excess fibrous connective tissue in the heart) plays an essential role in the prognosis of this disease.</p>

<p>Dr. Pereira notes interestingly that they also found that genetic variation in or near&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;was significantly associated with death due to heart failure.</p>



<p>They also noted that decreasing this gene’s expression in cardiac connective tissue significantly decreased cardiac fibroblast proliferation and downregulated the&nbsp;<em>IL1RL1</em>&nbsp;gene. This gene encodes one of the most important heart failure biomarkers, sST2. High levels of this biomarker are associated with fibrosis and death; a decrease in&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;decreases the expression of this protein. Understanding the regulation of sST2 and its relationship with&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;and fibrosis is essential for developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of heart failure.</p>



<p>Dr. Pereira explains that these findings raise the possibility of targeting the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene to decrease cardiac fibrosis, which may improve heart function. The study, therefore, has implications for developing new drug therapies for dilated cardiomyopathy and potentially other conditions affected by fibrosis.</p>



<p>According to a report from the American Heart Association, heart failure is an increasingly common diagnosis in the U.S., with a projection of affecting over 8 million people by 2030, an increase of 46% from the present day.</p>



<p>Between 30% and 40% of heart failure cases are due to dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>



<p>"It is the most common cause of a person needing a heart transplant," says Dr. Pereira. “A key indicator of whether patients with dilated cardiomyopathy will recover is whether they have cardiac fibrosis.”</p>



<p>Based on these preliminary findings, the Mayo researchers are doing further animal studies to understand the effect of&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;on heart failure. They are developing molecules to assess their therapeutic potential for dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.</p>



<p>"By continuing with this research that started with a human population that we took to the molecular and now animal laboratory, we hope to find new avenues for treatments to take back to the human population we studied, to improve patients' survival and quality of life ultimately," says Dr. Pereira.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Funding</strong></h2>



<p>The Mayo Clinic Department of Cardiovascular Medicine and Center for Individualized Medicine funded the study. Review the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37800334/">study</a> for a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding. </p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. – Last year's heavy snow season has many people thinking about what Mother Nature has in store this year. To stay healthy this holiday season and beyond, Mayo Clinic Health System is recommending people pace themselves while clearing snow.</p>



<p>"Many people don't realize the workout involved while shoveling and digging out from a heavy snowfall," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/nagaraja-vinayak-m-b-b-s/bio-20518668">Vinayak Nagaraja, M.D.</a>, interventional cardiologist at Mayo Clinic. "It's an arduous activity that puts extra strain on your heart, and for those with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, we recommend having someone else clear the snow altogether."</p>



<p>The cardiovascular stressors of shoveling are both physiological and psychological.</p>



<p>The physiological stressors include your blood vessels constricting from being out in the cold, which increases blood pressure. In people with underlying conditions, this alone can lead to chest pain.</p>



<p>"The psychological part has to do with the mental stress of being out in the bitter cold and being determined to keep going and keep shoveling even though you're exhausted," says Dr. Nagaraja.</p>



<p>If you have a history of heart problems and are physically inactive, it’s best to consult with your healthcare team before starting heavy exercise like shoveling. In addition, don’t shovel while smoking, eating or right after consuming caffeine since this may place extra stress on your heart.</p>



<p>Here are a few other tips to consider:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drink plenty of water.</strong></h2>



<p>Remaining hydrated during cold-weather months is just as important as during warm-weather months. Drink water or electrolyte drinks before, during and after your shoveling session, even if you're not thirsty.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shovel snow while it's fresh.</strong></h2>



<p>Freshly fallen snow is lighter than snow that has started melting or has been moved by a plow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Take it slow.</strong></h2>



<p>Pace yourself and take breaks if you need to. Safety is more important than speed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Listen to your body.</strong></h2>



<p>This is the No. 1 snow-shoveling tip. If something doesn't feel normal or you’re tired, it’s time to stop. Go inside, warm up, rest and drink water, tea or coffee. Reevaluate how your body feels before picking up where you left off.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Have your phone handy.</strong></h2>



<p>If you're experiencing an emergency, call 911 immediately.</p>

<p>During Thanksgiving, food often takes center stage at gatherings of friends and family. The focus is on turkey, pie and all the sides. But it also can challenge healthy eating habits.</p>



<p>Andrea Delgado, a Mayo Clinic dietitian, says that by paying attention to how much you eat and how often, you can make <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20047702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy food</a> choices during the holidays.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/nR-biL5MVSw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: The Mayo Clinic Minute</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:01) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/SCRIPT-MCM-Making-Healthy-Holiday-Food-Choices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Sit down. Enjoy your holiday meal, says Delgado.</p>



<p>"There's never an all-or-nothing approach in nutrition, you can still enjoy everything in moderation," she says.</p>



<p>Delgado says overindulging during the holidays can be a tipping point for some.</p>



<p>"Maybe now we have a new diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high cholesterol</a> or a new diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prediabetes</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> because, even though we only did it for a short period of time, it was enough that we were close enough to be diagnosed with these new conditions," she says.</p>



<p>One strategy includes weighing your options and making choices.</p>



<p>"Let's say I have a green bean casserole, which is filled with cream of mushroom and a lot of other ingredients, versus just a side of green beans. Your better option would be the green beans," she says.</p>

<p>But what about that pumpkin pie?</p>



<p>"We can still have a small wedge, but maybe we don't add the whipped topping or the additional toppings that we might add typically. It's not really cutting out entire foods. It's more how can we reduce the portion or what we add to those foods," says Delgado.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thanksgiving Day is also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/famhistory/knowing_not_enough.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ffeatures%2Ffamilyhealthhistory%2Findex.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Health History Day</a>, an annual national campaign to promote awareness of hereditary health traits in families.</strong></h3>



<p>Has your grandmother, mother, aunt or sister had breast or ovarian cancer? Has your grandfather, father or uncle had prostate, breast or pancreatic cancer? Is there a history in your family of colon cancer, diabetes or high cholesterol?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If any of these scenarios resonate within your family, you could also be at risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many hereditary health conditions follow patterns within families, with sometimes as high as a 50% likelihood that if one parent possesses a mutated gene, their child will inherit it. Recent Mayo Clinic&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-finds-1-in-8-patients-with-cancer-harbor-inherited-genetic-mutations/">research</a>&nbsp;shows that inherited, faulty genes cause more than 10% of all cancers.</p>



<p>"The biggest advice I would give is that if you are with your family this Thanksgiving, spend a few moments to share some of that family health history information. And if a red flag goes up, report that to your doctor. It could actually save someone's life," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/presutti-richard-john-j-d-o/bio-20053922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Presutti, D.O.</a>, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician and a researcher at the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Predictive power of genomics</strong></h3>



<p>Dr. Presutti has integrated genomics into his everyday medical decision-making for his patients, realizing the potential for improving health outcomes.</p>



<p>"If I can help identify patients at high risk for cancer and other diseases, then I can help get them started on screening earlier and avoid the situation of metastatic cancer and early cancer deaths," he says.</p>



<p>Equally important to the discovery of a person's inherited cancer mutation is the potential for them to share the heritable cause of their disease with their blood relatives, allowing family members to pursue care for earlier disease detection and cancer management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The power of genetics is that we can potentially foresee the cancer that will develop in other family members," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/samadder-niloy-jewel-jewel-j-m-d/bio-20396993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niloy Jewel Samadder, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and cancer geneticist. "This can allow us to target cancer screening to those high-risk individuals and hopefully prevent cancer altogether in the next generation of the family."</p>



<p>Dr. Samadder emphasizes that knowing your family health history can help you, but only if you act on it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Questions to ask family about health history</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Do you have chronic conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol?</li>



<li>Have you had serious diseases, such as cancer or stroke?</li>



<li>How old were you when each of these diseases or health conditions was diagnosed?</li>



<li>What is your family's ancestry? What countries or regions did your ancestors come from?</li>



<li>What were the causes and ages of death for relatives who have died?</li>
</ul>
