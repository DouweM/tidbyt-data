<p>MANKATO, Minn. — Sweating, nausea, dizziness and unusual fatigue may not sound like typical <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106">heart attack</a> symptoms. However, they are common for women and may occur more often when resting or asleep.<br><br>Unlike with men, pain, pressure or discomfort in the chest are not always severe or even the most prominent heart attack symptom in women. That’s why women need to understand their unique symptoms while also working to reduce their risk of heart disease.</p>



<p>"It's important to first recognize the risk factors of developing heart disease and then work to curb behaviors that might exacerbate that risk," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/chatura-alur-md-mph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chatura Alur, M.D.,</a> family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato. "Some factors play a more significant role in the development of heart disease in women than what are considered the tradition risks, such as high cholesterol, obesity and high blood pressure."</p>



<p>Women should also control these risk factors to help prevent heart disease:<br></p>



<ul>
<li>Diabetes</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/tips-to-keep-stress-from-hurting-your-heart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental stress</a> and depression</li>



<li>Smoking</li>



<li>Sedentary lifestyle<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Certain conditions, including menopause, broken heart syndrome and pregnancy complications also may increase a woman's risk for heart disease.</p>



<p>"Women of all ages should take heart disease seriously," says Dr. Alur. "Many women tend to downplay their symptoms and not seek care until heart damage has already occurred and an emergency room visit becomes necessary. We want women to understand the importance of listening to their bodies, understanding what feels normal to them, and seeking care before symptoms become severe."</p>



<p>Heart Month is a great time to brush up on knowledge about heart disease in women. Here are a few facts you may not have known.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Heart disease affects women of all ages.&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The combination of birth control pills and smoking boosts heart disease risks by 20% in young women, according to the American Heart Association. Risk also increases as women age. Overeating and leading a sedentary lifestyle are factors that lead to blocked arteries over time. Don't let your age lull you into a false sense of security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Heart disease isn't all about self-care.</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Unfortunately, all the salads and yoga in the world can't eliminate your heart disease risk. Family history often plays a factor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Knowing your heart health numbers can help.</strong></h2>



<p>The American Heart Association recommends you start getting your cholesterol checked at age 20, or earlier if your family has a history of heart disease. It’s also important to have your blood pressure checked regularly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Women can have heart attacks without previous symptoms.&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>According to the American Heart Association, 64% of women who die suddenly of coronary heart disease had no previous symptoms.</p>



<p>When women experience&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-disease/art-20046167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms</a> of a heart attack, those signs often are misinterpreted. Women's symptoms often are vague — shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and back or jaw pain. Other women experience dizziness, lightheadedness, pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, and extreme fatigue. If something feels off or not right, don't wait to seek medical attention.</p>

<p>A new Mayo Clinic systematic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074152142301306X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review</a> has shed light on genetically inherited aortic disorders, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for those who have inherited cardiovascular risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers identified that a procedure known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/multimedia/endovascular-repair-for-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/img-20123853#:~:text=In%20endovascular%20thoracic%20aortic%20aneurysm,with%20small%20hooks%20or%20pins." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR)</a> provided a high survival rate for young adult patients with type B <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-dissection/symptoms-causes/syc-20369496" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aortic dissections</a>. Type B aortic dissections consist of a tear in the descending part of the aorta that may extend into the abdominal aorta.</p>



<p>"We studied type B aortic dissections and aortic aneurysms and their management, especially in people born with genetic complications or syndromes," says Mohammed M. Firwana, M.B.B.S., research fellow and lead author of the study.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Firwana_Mohammed_21674922_202003050932-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-381417" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Firwana_Mohammed_21674922_202003050932-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Firwana_Mohammed_21674922_202003050932.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mohammed M. Firwana, M.B.B.S., research fellow and lead author of the study.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Notably, in over one-third of patients, genetic testing identified new aortic events within 15&nbsp;years. Patients with genetic risk factors exhibited a 62% rate of recurring aortic events, compared with 11% in patients without genetic risk factors, signifying the potential for more severe complications in the presence of such disorders.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana adds that some of the findings varied by race, underlining the critical need for awareness and early treatment across all demographics.</p>



<p>"One of the more interesting findings was that Black patients with genetic risk factors had lower mortality than White patients, and that's mostly explained by how they presented at a younger age and their condition was likely managed earlier," says Dr. Firwana.<br><br>Researchers underscore that aortic aneurysms, dissections, and ruptures are thought to be the cause of 43,000 to 47,000 fatalities in the U.S. each year and that approximately 20% of thoracic aortic aneurysms are related to the genetic condition, also known as heritable thoracic aortic disease. These conditions are often silent but can lead to aortic dissection or rupture with often fatal outcomes.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana emphasizes that identifying certain genetic mutations provides important knowledge and understanding of genetically inherited aortic disorders in patients.</p>



<p>He adds that there are multiple risk factors that can lead to a higher likelihood of aortic disorders, for example, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/marfan-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marfan syndrome</a>, a connective tissue disease, that affects one in 5,000 people in the U.S.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana notes that another condition that can leave people prone to aortic issues is hypertension.</p>



<p>"Hypertension stands out as an important risk factor," says Dr. Firwana.</p>



<p>"It contributes to the weakening of the walls of the aorta over time, making them more susceptible to tearing or dissection."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/WF516862_0012-1-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-381418" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/WF516862_0012-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/WF516862_0012-1.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">M. Hassan Murad, M.D., senior author of the study</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Researchers note that the systematic review is being used to help support guideline development&nbsp;when managing genetically inherited aortic disorders in patients and that more research is needed to identify the role of Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair in patients with&nbsp;connective tissue disease.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana emphasizes that quitting smoking, managing hypertension, and addressing diabetes are crucial preventive strategies for those with these genetic predispositions.</p>



<p>"A panel of experts from the Society for Vascular Surgery will use this systematic review to develop a clinical practice guideline that aims to help patients make decisions about their care," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/murad-m-hassan-m-d/bio-00094157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M.

<p>February is American Heart Month. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. African Americans are significantly affected by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, resulting in higher mortality rates compared to white Americans.</p>



<p>One of the reasons for the disparity is due to high <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension</a> rates in the Black community. Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, can increase your risk of developing heart disease.</p>

<p>The statistics are startling. One person dies every 33 seconds from cardiovascular disease in the United States. High cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and hypertension can cause heart problems.</p>



<p>"African Americans, unfortunately, have the highest rates of uncontrolled hypertension in the world, which dramatically increases their risk for developing heart disease," says Dr. Brewer.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Black Americans disproportionately impacted by cardiovascular disease</h3>



<p>She says elevated hypertension rates in the Black community can be attributed to various factors, including chronic stress, systemic racism and socioeconomic issues.</p>



<p>"That includes food insecurity, housing insecurity, redlining, which really limits certain individuals from receiving opportunities and resources to better their health," explains Dr. Brewer.</p>



<p>Dr. Brewer says simple lifestyle changes can reduce high blood pressure and heart disease, like eating healthier, getting regular physical activity and adequate sleep to reduce stress.</p>

<p><strong>1. Does loneliness affect heart health?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-does-loneliness-affect-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Loneliness</a> and social isolation have been linked to heart disease, Dr. Wamil says.</p>



<p>"Studies suggest that people who experience chronic loneliness may be at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases," Dr. Wamil says. "Social connections and supportive relationships contribute to overall well-being, and the lack of these connections can lead to increased stress, inflammation and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, all of which can impact heart health adversely."<br><br>Socializing is generally good for heart health, Dr. Wamil adds.</p>



<p>"Positive social interactions can reduce stress, lower blood pressure and improve overall emotional well-being," she says. "Engaging in social activities, spending time with loved ones and building a solid social support network can protect the heart."</p>



<p><strong>2. How does alcohol affect the heart?</strong></p>



<p>"While moderate <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/expert-answers/blood-pressure/faq-20058254?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alcohol</a> consumption may have some cardiovascular benefits, excessive drinking can lead to high blood pressure, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias," Dr. Wamil says. "It's crucial to adhere to recommended guidelines for alcohol intake and consult with a healthcare professional about individual risk factors."</p>



<p><strong>3. How can someone tell the difference between a panic attack and a heart attack?</strong></p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106?lt&amp;p=1?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart attack symptoms</a> often include radiating pain to the left arm, your jaw or back. Other symptoms can be nausea and sweating," Dr. Wamil says. "<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/symptoms-causes/syc-20376021?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Panic attacks</a> may involve a sudden surge of intense fear and discomfort, often with a feeling of impending doom."</p>



<p>Dr. Wamil advises against guessing the answer to this question.</p>



<p>"If unsure, it is crucial to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-heart-attack/basics/art-20056679?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seek immediate medical attention</a> if you are experiencing symptoms suggestive of a heart attack, as this condition requires prompt evaluation and treatment," she says.<br><br><strong>4. What signs or symptoms should you watch for in your overall heart health?</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Signs</a> of potential heart issues include chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and irregular heartbeats. It's important to be aware of these symptoms and seek medical attention if they occur, especially if they are severe or persistent.</p>



<p><strong>5. How can you protect your heart health during festive times, when food is plentiful, and you may not exercise as often?</strong></p>



<p>It's all about <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/3-steps-to-control-your-environment-and-weight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mindfulness</a>, Dr. Wamil says.</p>



<p>"Pay attention to portion sizes and avoid overindulging in high-calorie and high-fat foods," she says.  "Moderation is vital when it comes to alcohol to prevent potential heart issues. Keep your body active by incorporating physical activities into your festive routines, helping to counteract the effects of increased calorie intake. Manage <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/basics/stress-basics/hlv-20049495?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress</a> with techniques like mindfulness and deep breathing, as stress can impact your heart health."</p>



<p>Avoid highly processed foods that contain added sugars, excessive salt and trans fats, and limit saturated fats in red meat, full-fat dairy and fried foods, she adds.</p>



<p>"These simple steps can contribute to a healthier and happier festive season for your heart," Dr. Wamil says.</p>



<p><strong>6. What are some heart-healthy foods that people can work into their meals?<br></strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/basics/healthy-diets/hlv-20049477?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart-healthy foods</a> include fruits and vegetables, which are rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, Dr. Wamil says.</p>



<p>"Whole grains are also important," she adds. "Oats, quinoa and brown rice provide fibre and nutrients."</p>



<p>When it comes to protein, focus on lean options, such as fish, beans, legumes and skinless poultry. Also consider working in healthy fats by adding avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil to your diet, Dr. Wamil says.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What a coronary calcium scan measures</h3>



<p>A coronary calcium scan is a CT scan of the heart. It's a tool to help estimate risk more accurately.</p>



<p>"The objective is to measure the amount of calcifications in the arteries that feed your heart, the coronary arteries," Dr. Fernandes says.</p>



<p>The scan, he says, can see if there is plaque that contains calcium.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Scan-2-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Dr Regis Fernandes reviews a coronary calcium scan" class="wp-image-380937" style="width:841px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Scan-2-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Scan-2-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Scan-2-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Scan-2-16-x-9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Scan-2-16-x-9.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Regis Fernandes reviews a coronary calcium scan</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"It's not harmful. But the more calcium you have in there, the more plaque you have — and the more plaque, the higher the risk," says Dr. Fernandes.</p>



<p>You can't lower your score, but you can lower your risk by making lifestyle changes.</p>



<p>"But by lowering your cholesterol level through diet and medications, etc., the cholesterol gets removed, the plaque stabilizes," says Dr. Fernandes.</p>



<p>And the scan can help determine if medications are right for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"A calcium score is a risk assessment tool. That's the key is to help people to decide if they go on a medication or not, and how much of it and what's the more accurate way to measure that risk," Dr. Fernandes.</p>

<p>Dr. Fernandes says new technology enables calculating coronary calcium scores from scans used for other purposes, such as cancer screening.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team to find out if you're a candidate for a coronary calcium scan.</p>

<p>Let's start with sleep.</p>



<p>"Seven to eight hours of sleep at night is recommended for ideal cardiovascular health," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "Fewer hours or poor-quality sleep can lead to physical symptoms that impact the rest of your body, including your heart."</p>



<p>In addition to sleep, it's important to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Maintain an appropriate weight.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Keep Blood glucose, blood cholesterol and blood pressure within range.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Follow an eating plan rich in nutrients, such as the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Mediterranean</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">DASH diets</a>.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Exercise.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Get at least <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-stacking-your-exercise-over-the-weekend/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">150 minutes</a> of moderate-intensity physical activity every week," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "This does not necessarily have to be split up 30 minutes, five days a week, even though that's an easy way that we think about it. Really, every little thing that you do adds up."</p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. — As people age, many start to experience more aches and pains throughout their bodies. While many symptoms can be chalked up to the natural aging process, it's important to pay special attention to the cardiovascular system.</p>



<p>"Heart Month is a great time of year to remind people that not all symptoms are created equal when it comes to our cardiovascular health," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/vinayak-nagaraja-mbbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vinayak Nagaraja, M.B.B.S.</a>, interventional cardiologist at Mayo Clinic Health System. "If you have any concerns about symptoms you may be experiencing, it's always a good idea to meet with your primary care provider to determine if you should be referred to a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a>."</p>



<p>So what are some warning signs for underlying problems? Symptoms that suggest you may need a referral to a cardiologist include:<br><br></p>



<ul>
<li>Chest discomfort.</li>



<li>Shortness of breath.</li>



<li>Swelling in your legs.</li>



<li>High blood pressure.</li>



<li>Abnormally fast or slow heart rate.</li>



<li>Dizziness or fainting.</li>



<li>Strong family history of premature heart disease or cardiac death.</li>



<li>Leg pain or ulcers resulting from blood vessel diseases.<br><br></li>
</ul>



<p>A cardiologist will evaluate your symptoms, review your medical history and may recommend diagnostic tests to appropriately diagnose the cause of your symptoms. The cardiologist also will help your healthcare team evaluate the best form of treatment for you.</p>



<p>Your individualized treatment plan could include:<br><br></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Advice on diet and exercise changes</strong><br>You can lower your risk of heart disease by eating a low-fat and low-sodium diet, getting at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol intake. Dr. Nagaraja recommends eating a Mediterranean diet and avoiding red meat as well as processed food. He also suggests practicing yoga and meditation.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Medications</strong><br>If lifestyle changes alone aren't enough, your cardiologist may prescribe medications to control your condition. The type of medication you receive will depend on the type of heart condition and severity.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>A cardiac procedure</strong><br>If medications aren't enough, your cardiology care team may recommend specific procedures or surgery. The type of procedure or surgery will depend on the type of heart condition and the extent of the damage to your heart.<br><br></li>
</ul>



<p>If your cardiologist decides that you need cardiac surgery, you may be referred to a cardiovascular surgeon who specializes in operations on the heart, lungs and blood vessels. After you recover from the surgery, you will be sent back to your cardiologist for long-term monitoring and care.</p>



<p>"It may seem daunting to think about being diagnosed with a cardiovascular condition that requires surgical intervention, but discovering and treating the issue early can save your life," says Dr. Nagaraja.</p>

<p>In a new study, Mayo Clinic researchers found that a novel 4D echo imaging method that measures cardiac strain may detect subtle changes in the heart's dysfunction during acute <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myocarditis</a>, a deadly heart disease. In addition, they were able to describe heart functional differences by sex using the technology in a preclinical model. Currently, there are no disease-specific therapies to treat myocarditis.</p>



<p>The research is published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223025701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iScience</a>.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a> is one of the most common methods of measuring heart function and allows physicians to screen for heart issues, as well as monitor patients with existing heart conditions, such as myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle often caused by viral infections. The test shows how blood moves through the heart's chambers and valves. Cardiac strain is a measurement that shows how well the heart muscle can move. When the muscle is inflamed, it can stiffen. It is particularly important to know the function of the left ventricle, which is the most muscular and hard-working chamber of the heart.</p>



<p>Myocarditis occurs most frequently in men under the age of 50 (especially ages 16-30). Women are at the greatest risk of developing the condition after the age of 50, or when they are postmenopausal, according to the researchers.</p>



<p>In this study, the researchers used a model of viral myocarditis to compare sex differences in male and female mice with myocarditis to a control group of mice after day 10 of infection. The researchers discovered that sex differences existed in cardiac strain during myocarditis, which they say was not known previously, and that worse cardiac strain in male mice with myocarditis correlated with more cardiac inflammation than in female mice with the condition. The data suggested that worse cardiac function may correlate to the severity of cardiac inflammation.</p>



<p>That data allowed the researchers to predict which mice were most likely to suffer from heart failure, which also occurs more often in men.</p>



<p>Researchers analyzed different echocardiography imaging techniques to measure heart function and found that the more traditional ones had limits and only showed a small portion of the total picture of how the heart changes during the disease process.</p>

<p>"Until<strong> </strong>now, we have not had access to technology that can precisely describe small changes in cardiac function during acute myocarditis," says the study's senior author, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fairweather-delisa-ph-d/bio-20320752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeLisa Fairweather, Ph.D.</a>, vice-chair of translational research for the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Cardiovascular Medicine</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida, where she also leads a <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/translational-cardiovascular-disease-research/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Translational Cardiovascular Disease Research Laboratory</a>. "Using a novel 4D echocardiography imaging technique in mice, we more precisely described functional changes in cardiac strain that occur during myocarditis by sex. Knowing how our model functionally relates to human disease allows us to draw clearer conclusions as to the efficacy of novel treatments moving forward that can save patients' lives."</p>



<p>The researchers say their findings demonstrate the importance of using cardiac strain to assess cardiac function in patients with suspected myocarditis, and especially focusing on sex differences, which are associated with clinical outcomes.</p>



<p>"Our discoveries will help us investigate how effective new treatments and drugs may be for human disease and how they may improve cardiac function using our preclinical model," says Dr. Fairweather. "This can make the process of assessing new drugs for treatment faster and more accurate."</p>



<p>"Cardiac strain also can be used to assess patients for changes in heart function during earlier stages of disease, which means doctors can treat them earlier to mitigate long-term, irreversible heart damage," she added.</p>



<p>Dr. Fairweather's body of research on myocarditis also includes a recently published paper in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.202303317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the journal Small</a> that found that extracellular vesicles isolated from the platelets of healthy people used in a mouse model of viral myocarditis decreased inflammation and improved cardiac function. Dr. Fairweather says this preclinical research will pave the way for future clinical trials in humans. The research team says their work on cardiac strain demonstrates key differences in cardiac function between male and female mice with myocarditis and matches what is found clinically in patients.</p>



<p>The next step in the team's research is to use these techniques when testing new treatments for myocarditis in their preclinical animal model.</p>



<p>This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under grant award R01 HL164520, American Heart Association and Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about/about-regenerative-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>.

<p>PHOENIX — For snowbirds who need joint replacement surgery, places like Arizona and Florida offer an enticing prospect in the dead of winter — the opportunity to recuperate in a warmer climate without fear of slipping and falling on ice.</p>



<p>Snowbirds are people who typically seek out warm winter climates to escape Arctic-like conditions at home, but there are also benefits from a medical standpoint. Regaining mobility after joint replacement is an important milestone for patients, and walking is one way to help them get there. Think flat sidewalks instead of potholes or bumps in your path caused by ice and snow melting and refreezing.</p>



<p>"After joint replacement, we strongly encourage patients to walk, walk, walk and gradually increase their activities," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/spangehl-mark-j-m-d/bio-20054096?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Spangehl, M.D.</a>, an orthopedic surgeon and chair of the Adult Reconstruction Division at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>. "We get some rain occasionally, but for the most part, they can be outside every day that they want to be outside. And that's part of the recovery."</p>



<p>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Phoenix's average temperature is 68 degrees in December and January, 72 degrees in February, and 77 degrees in March. In Jacksonville, the location of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, the average temperature is 68 degrees in December, 66 degrees in January, 69 degrees in February, and 75 degrees in March.</p>



<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/knee-replacement/about/pac-20385276?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">knee</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hip-replacement/about/pac-20385042?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hip</a> replacement or surgeries for other musculoskeletal conditions, moving is important after procedures such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/minimally-invasive-heart-surgery/about/pac-20384895?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart surgery</a>.</p>



<p>Planning is essential for any surgery, but it's especially important for a surgery <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/international?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">away from home</a>. If patients get on the surgical schedule earlier during their stays, they have the rest of their time to recuperate. Patients come a few days before surgery to meet with their surgeon and learn more about what to expect before, during and after the procedure. The surgeon also will go over any potential risks and complications, which are small. After surgery, patients can expect to receive some follow-up care in person, Dr. Spangehl says.</p>



<p>How long patients need to stay nearby the hospital to recover after surgery depends on the person. People who are fit and active may not need to stay as long as someone with comorbidities that affect their mobility. Those comorbidities include having arthritis in other joints, Parkinson's disease, or heart or lung issues that affect stamina.</p>



<p>After surgery, patients should plan to have appropriate support — such as a family member — available nearby, Dr. Spangehl says.</p>



<p>"If you're traveling some distance for the procedure, you'll need someone who you're comfortable with and who can be there for a while to help you after surgery," he says.</p>



<p>Typically, once the person is mobile and can get around safely, they can return home, Dr. Spangehl says.</p>



<p>Mayo's snowbird connection to Arizona goes back decades. During their retirement years in the 1930s, Mayo Clinic's founders, brothers William J. Mayo, M.D., and Charles H. Mayo, M.D., and their wives headed to Arizona when the Minnesota winter set in. Their love of the Southwest came full circle when Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, opened in 1987.</p>

<p>Shoveling snow can be a good workout, but it's not for everyone.</p>



<p>"Shoveling snow is one of those uniquely dangerous cardiovascular stress tests for a variety of reasons," says Dr. Hayes.</p>



<p>She tells her heart patients, "I really don't want you to do that anymore. You can mow your lawn; you can go on hikes and walks. I want you to exercise."</p>



<p>The reasons, she says, are both physiological and psychological.</p>



<p>Physiological includes your blood vessels constricting from being out in the cold, which increases blood pressure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"And that's enough, in a vulnerable individual sometimes, to give them chest pain. Say they have some blockages, it might give them <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/symptoms-causes/syc-20369373?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">angina</a>, or chest pain," Dr. Hayes says.</p>



<p>Add that to the workload of digging heavy snow, and then ...</p>



<p>"... the psychologic part. And everyone, all of my patients, smile when I say it because it's a knowing smile, 'Oh, yeah,'" says Dr. Hayes.</p>



<p>Sometimes it's hard to stop once you start something.</p>



<p>"It's that combination of cold, extreme exertion, and then maybe sticking it out longer than is wise because we've got to finish and get to the end of the walk," Dr. Hayes explains.</p>



<p>It's best to check with your healthcare team about the advisability of shoveling heavy snow, says Dr. Hayes.</p>
