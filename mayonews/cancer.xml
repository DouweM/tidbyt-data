<p><a id="_msocom_1"></a>As the sun rises above the St. Johns River and casts a glow on the glass buildings of downtown Jacksonville, Florida, Ann Mackey returns from a walk with her dog Maggie and prepares to attend a book club discussion. It's moments like these she has come to truly appreciate after treatment for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>.</p>

<p>"I have always said you have to know when to be happy, and for me right now, this is a time to be happy," says Ann.</p>



<p>In the 1990s, her career brought her to Jacksonville, Florida, and it wasn't long before she felt connected to the community. Between corporate work, Ann found opportunities to volunteer, make friends and immerse herself in history, culture and literature. In 1994, she sought care at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>"Ann has been a patient at Mayo Clinic for more than 25 years," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ailawadhi-sikander-m-d/bio-20087330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sikander Ailawadhi</a>, a Mayo Clinic hematologist and oncologist. "While it was initially taking care of her primary care needs&nbsp;through family medicine to getting diagnosed with multiple myeloma, receiving many, many treatments and having a diagnosis of breast cancer, getting treatment for that, then having progression of myeloma and going through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/gnc-20405215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy</a>."</p>



<p>The treatments have evolved much like the surroundings where she attends appointments.</p>



<p>"I feel like I watched Mayo Clinic grow because the first time I came here, there was a single building on campus, and everyone I saw was extraordinary," says Ann. "I've always felt like the physicians knew me. They knew me as Ann, and I was amazed that there was that level of connection with physicians at Mayo. As my needs over the years happened, the Mayo team, the Mayo staff, and the Mayo buildings have still been growing."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-393651" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-768x511.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Ann-at-Butchart-Gardens-2048x1364.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ann Mackey visits Butchart Gardens near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ann was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer on three separate occasions. When a fellow working with her physician noticed an abnormality in her lab results, they investigated further, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of multiple myeloma.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We are being able to see over our lifetimes how the management of patients is being transformed," says Dr. Ailawadhi. "It's that effort to keep trying to put our heads together and making sure that the needs of the patient are getting served, not just today, but tomorrow. And that kind of thought process of mapping the patient's journey and walking that journey with the patient, hand in hand, helps us come up with stories like Ann's, where over more than 25 years, we have been able to find answers for her."</p>



<p>Ann's care led her to join a multiple myeloma support group, which she now co-leads from the same building where she received treatment. The group offers comfort to those in treatment and remission as well as connection to subject matter experts to explain advances in multiple myeloma care.</p>



<p>"That sort of relentless curiosity, that drive to figure out what it is, what's going on â€” I think that saved my life," says Ann. "I had my CAR-T therapy in June of 2022, and since then, I have had no treatment. I'm cancer-free. It's undetectable now, so I'm very happy I get to keep enjoying life. It's amazing." </p>



<p>Not only is Ann involved in restoring a Jacksonville landmark, Memorial Park, but she is also looking forward to new travel adventures and opportunities in retirement.<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>

<p>"Lymphoma in plain terms is essentially a cancer of your immune system," says Dr. Iqbal.</p>



<p>Patients who are newly diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352638?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymphoma</a> are offered a combination of chemotherapy and antibody-based treatments. But for those who do not respond to two or more lines of such treatments, CAR-T cell therapy may be an option.</p>



<p>"Prior to the advent of CAR-T cell therapy, patients who had failed two lines of chemotherapy had a very poor survival of around six months," says Dr. Iqbal.</p>



<p>Receiving CAR-T cell therapy can take a few weeks as a patient's T cells, which normally help fight off infections, are collected and genetically engineered to target lymphoma.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After low-dose chemotherapy, the modified cells are infused back into the patient. These cells can then attack and destroy the lymphoma.</p>



<p>"Patients who had a very poor prognosis can now potentially be cured of their disease," says Dr. Iqbal.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My 32-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. It's a lot to take in. We've heard about treatment-free remission. That sounds hopeful. What does that mean? How is it achieved?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> It is a lot to take in. Some background information may help you and your daughter understand this diagnosis and potential treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leukemias</a> are cancers of the blood cells. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chronic myelogenous leukemia</a> (CML) is an uncommon type of cancer of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-biopsy/about/pac-20393117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow</a>, which produces blood cells. "Myelogenous" refers to the type of blood cells this leukemia affects. "Chronic" means this cancer is more slowly progressing than other severe forms of leukemia.</p>



<p>CML is a genetic problem that causes overproduction of a protein that allows some blood cells to grow out of control. But the gene change that causes CML is not hereditary. Parents do not pass the gene to their children.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/chronic-myeloid-leukemia/about/statistics.html#:~:text=The%20American%20Cancer%20Society's%20estimates,780%20men%20and%20530%20women)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>, nearly 9,000 people are diagnosed with CML each year in the U.S. This type of leukemia typically affects older adult males, but both men and women can be diagnosed with CML. It is rarely seen in children.</p>



<p>Some people with CML may experience symptoms such as bone pain, bleeding easily and feeling full after eating a small amount. But many people do not have symptoms until later stages. It is diagnosed with a blood test.</p>



<p>People first diagnosed with CML likely will begin targeted treatment to eliminate blood cells that are overproducing a protein called tyrosine kinase. Medications called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are first-line treatments. Each medication has its own side effects, such as swelling or nausea, that differ for each patient and are discussed in the early stages of choosing treatment. At later stages, other treatments may include chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant.</p>



<p>Patients we consider for treatment-free remission include those in a low-risk category who take one kind of medication during their treatment course and are in what's called "molecular remission" for at least two years. Molecular remission means the gene that causes CML cannot be found in the patient's blood or bone marrow.</p>



<p>During and after treatment, regular tests are necessary to monitor the patient's blood. When no leukemia is detected, patients may be able to end treatment. Even patients in treatment-free remission must be monitored regularly, for life, and work closely with a hematologist or oncologist. That means testing monthly, progressing to every other month, then every three months, to every six months.</p>



<p>If a patient were to relapse, the disease would be discovered early, and treatment using the same kind of medication would be resumed. Studies over the last 10 to 15 years have shown when restarting medication early, the chance of achieving remission is almost 100%.</p>



<p>There are certain criteria before stopping TKI treatments. This is important as it affects women and family planning. Managing CML, pregnancy and childbirth is challenging but possible with the help of the healthcare team.</p>



<p>At Mayo, we started this treatment-free remission approach in 2015. Many patients have been off treatment for years.

<p>September is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aacr.org/patients-caregivers/awareness-months/childhood-cancer-awareness-month/#:~:text=September%20is%20Childhood%20Cancer%20Awareness%20Month%20%7C%20The%20AACR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Childhood Cancer Awareness Month</a>. The most common type of childhood cancer is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute lymphocytic leukemia</a>&nbsp;(ALL), a blood and bone marrow cancer that creates immature white blood cells that canâ€™t perform their typical functions. Because of this, the disease worsens quickly.</p>



<p>Most likely to occur in early childhood, ALL is more common in boys than girls, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/leukemia-in-children/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. Children younger than five are at highest risk for developing ALL.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ferdjallah-asmaa-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20518146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asmaa Ferdjallah, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric hematologist and oncologist, treats children of all ages with ALL. Hereâ€™s what she wants families to know about this disease:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. ALL is rare and has a collection of persistent symptoms.</h2>



<p>In 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>&nbsp;estimates that 6,540 new cases of ALL will be diagnosed in both children and adults. This represents less than half of 1% of all cancers in the U.S.</p>



<p>ALL symptoms vary and can resemble symptoms of flu and other common illnesses. Dr. Ferdjallah says most high fevers, swollen lymph nodes and bruises are part of typical childhood development. Parents should call their childâ€™s healthcare professional if those symptoms persist, co-occur or seem unusual.</p>



<p>"With ALL, we often see frequent or daily high fevers that you can't explain," says Dr. Ferdjallah. "We'll often see rapid weight loss that doesn't make sense for a child's activity level. And we always ask about lumps or bumps, which can indicate swollen lymph nodes, as well as night sweats, bone pain and any new bruising or bleeding."</p>



<p>If your healthcare team suspects your child has ALL, they will draw blood for testing. "We would expect to see changes in blood counts" in a child with ALL, says Dr. Ferdjallah. "Low hemoglobin, low platelets, low neutrophils â€” having all these low blood counts may suggest ALL."</p>



<p>In addition to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer-diagnosis/art-20046459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood test</a>, healthcare professionals may also use a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-biopsy/about/pac-20393117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow test</a>, imaging tests and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumbar-puncture/about/pac-20394631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spinal fluid test</a>&nbsp;to diagnose ALL.</p>



<p>Having one ALL symptom, such as a bruise or one low blood count, generally isnâ€™t something to worry about, says Dr. Ferdjallah. "ALL declares itself. Itâ€™s not going to sneak up on you. It creates a constellation of symptoms that we see."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Children diagnosed with ALL have well-researched options for precision care.</h2>



<p>Your childâ€™s care team will consider many factors when determining the best treatment for ALL, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The type of lymphocytes involved â€” B cells or T cells.</li>



<li>The specific genetic changes present in the childâ€™s leukemia cells.</li>



<li>The childâ€™s age.</li>



<li>Lab test results, such as the number of white blood cells detected in a blood sample.</li>
</ul>



<p>Care teams then tailor treatment plans for each patient based on factors that indicate standard risk or high risk for relapse. Called risk stratification, this approach to treatment has improved survival.</p>



<p>"Somebody with standard risk is usually between the ages of 1 and 10. A child in this age group with a white blood cell count of less than 50,000 is considered standard risk. Patients outside these parameters need more intense therapy and are considered high risk," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>



<p>For standard-risk patients, treatment typically involves chemotherapy given by infusion. "We also deliver chemotherapy into the spine via a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369083#dialogId13734717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spinal tap</a>&nbsp;because we know some leukemias are very good at hiding in that space, and this can prevent relapses and later recurrences," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>



<p>Treatment can take two to three years, and the first few months are most intense.</p>



<p>"After the first six months, the patient enters a period called maintenance," says Dr. Ferdjallah. "Then we see patients less often because they need less intense therapy. Kids return to school, and their immune system is a little stronger. They can go on vacation, and their hair starts to grow back. ALL starts to feel like an annoying thing to manage and less like a life-altering, devastating illness."</p>



<p>The care team will perform a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-biopsy/about/pac-20393117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow biopsy</a>&nbsp;to determine whether ALL is remission. "If there's no leukemia in the biopsy, that's the best sign that the patient is in remission, and that is associated with the best outcomes," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>



<p>There are many other options for children with high-risk genetic mutations or aggressive diseases for whom chemotherapy isnâ€™t effective. ALL treatments may include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033"></a><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted therapy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation therapy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow transplant</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20404319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/cancer-clinical-trials/about-cancer-clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trials</a>.</p>



<p>"We have multiple lines of therapy for these patients," says Dr. Ferdjallah. "Scientists and doctors have worked collaboratively for a long time to create networks, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://childrensoncologygroup.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group</a>, to conduct powerful clinical trials. The results of that research have informed us of the best therapy approaches," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. The outlook for kids diagnosed with ALL is excellent, and treatment options continue to improve.</h2>



<p>The five-year survival rate for children with ALL is about 90%, and if a child remains cancer-free five years after treatment, they are likely cured.</p>



<p>"Children diagnosed with ALL do well in survivorship. They're able to live normal, healthy lives â€” get married, have kids, and have a normal life span," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, available treatment options continue to improve.</p>



<p>"One of the most promising new treatment options is CAR-T cell therapy for pediatric patients, which uses a patient's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/t-cell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T cells</a>&nbsp;and genetically engineers them to target and kill their leukemia cells," says Dr. Ferdjallah. "That kind of therapy can save a patient from a stem cell transplant, which has more side effects and morbidity. Weâ€™ve seen good outcomes."</p>



<p>Dr. Ferdjallah is also excited about the development of new targeted therapies called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/immunotherapy/monoclonal-antibodies.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monoclonal antibodies</a>. "These drugs target mechanisms in leukemia cells that drive their ability to replicate quickly or damage normal tissues. (The drugs) tend to have fewer side effects than chemotherapy. That's exciting because it can improve quality of life," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Ferdjallah wants families coping with a childâ€™s ALL diagnosis to know there is good reason to hope. "Itâ€™s completely horrifying to think about your child having cancer, but the No. 1 thing I want parents to hear is that ALL is one of the most curable cancers. And we've come a long, long way with therapies."</p>

<p>According to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/cancer-facts-and-figures-for-hispanics-and-latinos/hispanic-latino-2021-2023-cancer-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;by the American Cancer Society, cancer is a leading cause of death among those of Hispanic heritage living in the U.S. Hispanic and Latino people are less likely to be diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-reducing-your-risk-of-lung-cancer/">lung</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/colorectal-cancer-myths-and-facts/">colon</a>, breast and&nbsp;prostate cancers&nbsp;than non-Hispanic white men and women.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesus-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jesse Bracamonte,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says preventive screenings for cancer and other diseases are effective ways to help reduce these burdens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/SCRIPT-MCM-Preventive-screenings-Hispanic75-RM21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"Colorectal cancers and breast cancers are on the rise in the Hispanic community. And one of those reasons may be from lack of preventive screening," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says culture, access to care and past experiences contribute. But early screening can prevent future serious health issues.</p>



<p>"Screening tests for diabetes&nbsp;(such as checking a simple blood sugar), for cardiovascular disease to prevent strokes&nbsp;(such as checking on cholesterol and blood pressure), colon cancer screening,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/when-to-start-regular-breast-cancer-screenings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer screening</a>&nbsp;for females, are all available tools," he says.</p>



<p>Talk with your doctor to determine the right preventive screenings and when to begin. For instance:&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Colon cancer screening for both men and women, usually at age 45, is an option, breast cancer screening for women in their 40s such as with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram,</a>" he says.</p>

<p>Dr. Bracamonte recommends having a list of questions for your doctor about what you can do to stay healthy.</p>



<p>"Have that list prepared about what I should get done to keep me healthy in the long term. What behaviors can I do in the long term to stay healthy? Because I think prevention is a key," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/car-tcell-infographic/ifg-20511593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> is a treatment that harnesses the power of a person's immune system to combat cancer cells. In this regenerative immunotherapy, a person's T cells, or white blood cells known as lymphocytes that are involved in the immune system response â€” are collected and genetically modified to produce chimeric antigen receptors or CARs. They are then infused back into the patient's blood stream, where they target and destroy cancer cells. Mayo Clinic researchers are advancing and improving CAR-T cell therapy to expand its capabilities to treat more conditions. Read more about the latest advances in CAR-T at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While many CAR-T cell therapies use a patient's own cells, Mayo Clinic is also exploring the applications of allogeneic, or "off-the-shelf," CAR-T therapies. These are generated by healthy donors or gene-edited sources that have been genetically altered to reduce the possibility of rejection by the patient's immune system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This can provide a faster turnaround time for manufacturing, expand patient access and allow patients to receive CAR-T cell therapy at the time of need," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lin-yi-m-d-ph-d/bio-00092684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yi Lin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a hematologist and oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>.Â </p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy is usually offered as a later-stage therapy for various blood cancers, but recent research has shown it may be useful in some blood cancer cases earlier in a patient's treatment plan.</p>



<p>"CAR-T cell therapy in earlier lines of treatment has reported superior outcomes as compared to using it in later lines of therapy," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fonseca-rafael-m-d/bio-00083333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rafael Fonseca, M.D.</a>, hematologist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.â€¯</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers are working to apply <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> to solid tumors in thyroid cancer. CAR-T has shown promising results in blood cancers, and new research is focused on using this treatment on more types of malignancies.</p>



<p>"CAR-T cell therapy is unlike other therapeutics," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a hematologist and cancer researcher.&nbsp;"Other therapies may slow down cancer.

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> could provide a revolutionary approach to organ transplantation for "sensitized patients" who are hard to match and susceptible to rejection, Mayo Clinic researchers discovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their pioneering research focuses on using CAR-T cells derived from the patient's own immune system to prevent rejection of donated organs. Sensitized patients are those who have high levels of antibodies that cause their immune systems to react negatively to potential donor organs. These patients often face extended waiting periods for a transplant.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Research from this proof-of-concept study is published in <a href="https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(24)00159-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidney International</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"This research is one of the first steps toward applying CAR-T cells in the field of transplantation to try to make more donor organs available for transplant and reduce the wait for patients who need a new kidney," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/jarmi-tambi-m-d/bio-20536410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tambi Jarmi, M.D.</a>, first author on the study and a transplant nephrologist at Mayo Clinic in Florida.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic scientists have developed an immunotherapy strategy that potentially lays the groundwork for treating a spectrum of autoimmune diseases.</p>



<p>The new technique, detailed in a preclinical study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01195-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Biomedical Engineering</a>, involves combining chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which are found in various tissues in the body and are known for calming down the immune system, controlling inflammation and promoting immune tolerance to prevent the body's own tissues from being attacked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The pioneering approach shows potential in targeting inflammatory disease sites more precisely and improving immunosuppression and healing outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kenderian</a>. "We're planning to study interventions that minimize the need for long-term medications for autoimmune diseases."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic cancer researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vile-richard-g-ph-d/bio-00027663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</a>, is leading research into genetically engineered viruses aimed at unleashing a two-pronged attack on cancer. One part of this technology, known as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/oncolytic-virus-optimizes-car-t-cell-therapy-for-solid-tumors/mac-20537878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oncolytic virus</a>, is designed to infect, break open and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. Dr. Vile's <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn2231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preclinical studies</a> have shown that oncolytic viruses replicated in cancer cells and cascaded to kill other diseased cells. That, in turn, triggered an immune response in which the patient's own T cells, stimulated by the virus, recognized and targeted metastasized tumors for a second wave of cancer destruction.</p>



<p>"Oncolytic viruses are a way to alert the immune system and mobilize it to kill cells infected with cancer," says Dr. Vile. "There's the direct killing of cancer cells with the virus, and then there's the major effect of immune activation. The immune system is incredibly well evolved to recognize infection, clear infection and kill all the cells around it that could be harboring infection."&nbsp; </p>



<p>Dr. Vile's team is combining oncolytic viruses with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> to target solid tumors from liver cancer. This experimental approach of loading CAR-T cells with oncolytic virus is a new way to expand CAR-T cell therapy beyond treatment for blood cancers into treatment for solid tumors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic research has developed a new type of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> aimed at killing B-cell blood cancers that have returned and are no longer responding to treatment. This pioneering technology, designed and developed in the lab of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, killed B-cell tumors grown in the laboratory and tumors implanted in mouse models. The preclinical findings are published in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00262-023-03537-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."</p>



<p>Dr Qin's team developed a cell therapy to target a protein known as B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) found in patients with B-cell cancers, particularly those with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a>. The BAFF-R protein is linked to tumor growth. The cell therapy under investigation allows the immune system to quash cancer and target tumors that have returned or have resisted available CAR-T cell therapies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers who mined the molecular foundations of cancer have uncovered a new reason <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> fails in some patients. This discovery has fueled new strategies that incorporate antibodies and gene editing to improve the outcome of this breakthrough treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This is a very exciting discovery that offers new hope of overcoming challenges of CAR-T cell therapy that many cancer patients experience," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kenderian</a>, a hematologist and senior author on this research, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51978-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We describe for the first time a mechanism causing the resistance and failure of CAR-T cells, which lies within a protein routinely made by the engineered cells. This research puts us on a new path for improving the longevity of CAR-T cell therapy."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Editor's Note: <em>September is Leukemia and Lymphoma Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. â€” Treatment for blood cancers is advancing, giving more options to people living with the disease.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ailawadhi-sikander-m-d/bio-20087330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sikander Ailawadhi, M.D.</a>, an oncologist and hematologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/international" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Jacksonville, Florida, says that physicians are identifying, monitoring and eliminating disease earlier and more deeply, thanks to targeted drug therapies and novel treatments like CAR-T cell therapy. Dr. Ailawadhi is an expert in blood cancers, particularly myeloma.</p>

<p>Worldwide, cancer is a leading cause of death, accounting for nearly 10 million â€” nearly 1 in 6 â€” deaths in 2020, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Health Organization</a>. New cases of blood cancers â€”&nbsp; leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma â€” were expected to account for <a href="https://tlls.org/facts-and-statistics/facts-and-statistics-overview/facts-and-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 10% </a>&nbsp;of new cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. in 2020.</p>



<p>Drug treatments for blood cancers have evolved. In the past, myeloma patients received two drugs in sequence â€” two after two. Now, they receive four drugs together at once, with more patients going into remission. Some treatments are becoming so effective â€” even after a stem-cell transplant â€” that a subset of patients may be able to stop their medications altogether, Dr. Ailawadhi says. Clinical trials studying that approach are underway.</p>



<p>Blood cancer patients have more immunotherapies available, including CAR-T, which uses the body's immune system to fight cancer. CAR-T involves genetically modifying T cells to activate the immune system to find and kill certain cancers. The Food and Drug Administration approved CAR-T for certain types of leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. The therapy is now in clinical trials as a potential option for breast, brain, pancreatic cancer, sarcoma and rheumatoid disorders such as lupus.</p>



<p>If patients can't receive CAR-T, they may be able to receive a class of drugs called T-cell engagers. Unlike CAR-T, T-cell engagers do not need to be manufactured. Typically, patients receive T-cell engagers on an inpatient basis. However, at Mayo Clinic, the treatment is outpatient, Dr. Ailawadhi says.</p>



<p>"Historically a patient who had cancer for 10 years did not suddenly go into remission and stay in remission," Dr. Ailawadhi says. "Now with these novel options like CAR-T and T-cell engagers, even patients who have had years of cancer are going into remission."</p>



<p>If their cancer eventually returns, patients may be able to receive treatments that were not available when they were originally diagnosed. A few years ago, Dr. Ailawadhi treated a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/john-cadwallader-has-hope-time-and-new-options-after-car-t-treatment-for-multiple-myeloma/">man</a> with myeloma from the U.K. The patient received CAR-T at Mayo Clinic and went into remission, but the disease returned about nine months later. By that time, new clinical trials had become available in the U.K. The patient started care locally and is being monitored by his Mayo team from Florida and London.</p>



<p>"With that time, he was able to get to more options for treatments," Dr. Ailawadhi says.</p>



<p>The sensitivity of diagnostic tests has advanced, allowing oncologists to tell if a patient has achieved a deep response. Tests can detect one cancer cell in 100,000 normal cells. As techniques improve, tests eventually may be able to detect one in 1 million or one in 10 million, Dr. Ailawadhi says. In the future, researchers hope to construct a predictive model that could tell patients how likely they are to achieve a depth of response, get into remission and stop their medications.</p>



<p>Some patients also can receive care at home. A subset of stem-cell transplant patients come to the hospital for three days of treatment, and then transition to care at home, Dr. Ailawadhi says. Medications for managing pain, nausea and other side effects of blood cancers have evolved too. Large centers may offer patients resources for palliative care, pain medicine, interventional radiology, psychology, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.</p>



<p>"It's very important to understand the patient's quality of life before the cancer," Dr. Ailawadhi says. "One of the major goals of treatment is to try to get the patient as close as possible to that again while we work to control the cancer."</p>

<p>Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, or TIL therapy, uses the body's own immune cells to target cancer â€” in this case, advanced melanoma. The process, which takes about three weeks, begins with surgery.</p>



<p>"We remove the cancer; it's sent off to a lab, and those immune cells, those lymphocytes, are isolated, separated out and enriched."</p>



<p>While the cells are prepared, the patient undergoes chemotherapy in preparation for their own immune cells, which recognize the melanoma, to be infused back into their body.</p>



<p>"When we give them back to the patient, they can effectively target the cancer," says Dr. Jakub. And now, in numbers, they can overwhelm the cancer and kill it."</p>



<p>Blood tests and scans measure the body's response three months after treatment. For those who have failed multiple lines of treatment, this one-time therapy offers hope.</p>



<p>"It's the potential that their cancer may not come back again, and they may not need any additional therapy," says Dr. Jakub.</p>

<p>Genetic technology has the potential to significantly improve human health by improving disease risk prediction and guiding prevention strategies. The development of a new genetic test called a polygenic risk score is a major advance. Still, it may widen health disparities because such scores may not work equally well for different populations. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kullo-iftikhar-j-m-d/bio-00084951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iftikhar Kullo, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic, believes that global collaboration is needed to refine polygenic risk scores so they perform equitably across people from diverse groups.</p>



<p>Dr. Kullo recently authored a perspective piece in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01843-2#:~:text=Such%20collaborations%20should%20be%20guided,assessment%2C%20global%20collaboration%20is%20critical." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Genetics</a>, where he made the case for efforts to bring genomics to low- and middle-income countries. His argument is that the information gleaned from testing could not only benefit local populations but also many other groups around the world, including in the U.S. Here, he elaborates on this.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You've noted that the disease burden worldwide is shifting from communicable diseases such as &nbsp;hepatitis and influenza to noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer. How can genetics address this shift?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> The shift from infectious disease to noncommunicable disease is part of the "epidemiologic transition." Famines and pandemics were once the leading cause of mortality, but fortunately, these were addressed by antibiotics, vaccinations and adequate food production. Now, we live longer and, as a result, are prone to developing other diseases like heart disease, diabetes or cancer. One of the ways that we can reduce the burden of these noncommunicable diseases is to employ better ways of predicting risk. For many of these conditions, we have existing tools for risk prediction, but they don't always perform as well as we would like them to.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You are referring to a new genetic test called a polygenic risk score. Could you explain what a polygenic risk score is, and how it works?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Genetically, humans are 99.9% similar. Our genome has three billion letters (A, G, T and C), and every 1,000 letters or so, there is a variation or difference between any two people. These differences, or variants, account for how we look or behave, how we might react to drugs, and our predisposition to different diseases. Polygenic risk scores add up information from multiple such genetic variants that affect our risk of developing certain diseases. Each variant is not very useful by itself, but if we combine the information from many â€” thousands or even millions of variants in some cases â€” we get useful and actionable information about disease risk.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the limitation of polygenic risk scores? How could they widen global health disparities?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Polygenic risk scores don't perform well across different genetic ancestry groups. Because the vast majority of genetic studies are done in people of European genetic ancestry, these scores don't work very well, for example, in people of African genetic ancestry. One way we can address that disparity is to increase diversity in our studies here in the U.S., but an even better approach may be to undertake a global effort, conducting this work in diverse regions across the globe. We know that using diverse sources of data will improve the performance of these scores for everybody.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You wrote that African datasets are still a high priority for genomic studies. Yet, they are the least represented â€” less than 2% of human genomes analyzed so far are of people with African genetic ancestry. How can studying African genomes help advance our understanding of the genomic basis of common diseases in all people?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Africa contains the greatest genetic diversity among the continents, accumulated over 300,000 years of human evolution. By studying people of African ancestry, we will learn so much more about human origins and genetics because we're all Africans, in a way â€” that's where Homo sapiens arose. That long evolutionary history means that African populations could yield more information about genetic variants associated with disease. And it's a chance to make up for this big disparity in the number of Africans in genomic studies thus far.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What steps do you believe are necessary to achieve equity in the availability of polygenic risk scores to improve global health?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> We certainly need to increase the representation of minorities in genomic studies. Mayo Clinic is part of a large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded consortium called <a href="https://emerge.study/mayo-clinic/">eMERGE</a> that is looking at polygenic risk scores for 10 common conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, breast cancer and prostate cancer. The consortium is committed to ensuring that at least half of the 25,000 participants across the country come from diverse groups.</p>



<p>It's important to learn about the spectrum of genetic variation in all of humanity, not just in one group. I believe that means going beyond our borders, helping other countries to set up infrastructure to generate their own genetic data and creating resources for data-sharing across the globe. It's not an easy task, but we have many elements in place, and I think it's doable.</p>

<p>Patients with cancer not only have to worry about fighting the disease, but they also must battle the cumbersome side effects, like fatigue and other symptoms related to cancer and its treatment.</p>



<p>"Side effects from cancer and treatment of cancer, such as pain, delirium, nausea, vomiting and debility, can also contribute to their cancer-related fatigue," says Dr. Barksdale.</p>

<p>Palliative medicine is a crucial component of cancer treatment. Its main purpose is to improve the patient's overall well-being.</p>



<p>"Whether that's more holistic care through integrative and complementary medicine, more Western-based medicines, psychological care, music therapy, aromatherapy, Reiki, tai chi â€” we have lots of things we can do to help reduce suffering," explains Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<p>Palliative care is not the same as hospice care. The latter focuses on making patients comfortable and managing symptoms nearing the end of life when further curative treatments are no longer available.</p>



<p>"Palliative care, to me, is hope because what we're doing is we're improving your quality of life," says Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<p>This type of care is available at any stage of cancer treatment.</p>
