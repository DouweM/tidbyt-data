<p>"Thyroid, and mainly thyroid hormones, are the gas pedal, if you will, for the body," says Dr. Stan.</p>



<p>"And as we're pushing that gas pedal, metabolism accelerates, our heart rate beats faster, we feel hot, we can't rest, we can't sleep," he says.</p>



<p>Other symptoms of Graves' disease may include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperthyroidism/expert-answers/thyroid-disease/faq-20058228?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a>, weight loss, heat sensitivity and bulging eyes.</p>



<p>"It's a situation of an overactive thyroid that is caused by antibodies that we unfortunately produce that end up really whipping the thyroid into an overactive state," he says.</p>

<p>Dr. Stan is leading several clinical&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/stan-marius-n-m-d/bio-00028124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;trials targeting the disorder.</p>



<p>"I'm quite optimistic, looking at some of the early results of our trials, that there will be major benefits for patients in the coming years," he says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When to see a doctor</h3>



<p>Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is more common among women and in people younger than age 40.</p>



<p>If you experience unintentional weight loss, a rapid heartbeat, unusual sweating, swelling at the base of your neck, or other signs of hyperthyroidism, schedule an appointment with your healthcare professional. Make sure to communicate all observed symptoms, including minor ones, during your appointment.</p>

<p>When your parents told you to put on a coat before you go outside or you'll catch cold, there's a small kernel of truth to that.</p>



<p>"If you're a little bit colder outside, your body's immune system may just drop a little bit because it's spending extra effort to keep you warm. That's not with everybody, but, in some cases, it may predispose you to a cold," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>But, he says, the cold weather itself doesn't cause the common cold. However, as winter temps dip down, the chances of spreading a respiratory virus go up because more time is spent indoors with others.</p>



<p>"When it's cold outside, typically people gather around the fireplace or around your home. Therefore, if people are sick, you're more likely to be in close proximity to someone who is ill, thus catch the cold," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says if you do catch a cold or one of the common viruses that cause the common cold, it's important to remember that it's a virus in most cases not a bacterial infection, so antibiotics usually don't help. Staying hydrated, getting plenty of rest and eating healthy are all important.</p>



<p>"In most cases, for most healthy people, we call it supportive management: time, rest, chicken soup and just staying away from others is usually the best medicine," he says.</p>

<p>A<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> urinary tract infection</a> (UTI) is common, but it can be serious.</p>



<p>"Simple urinary tract infections can be managed by your primary care provider, but when they become complex leading to other issues or problems, you should seek the care of a specialist," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/humphreys-mitchell-r-m-d/bio-20055033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mitchell Humphreys</a>, a urologist at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is a UTI?</strong></h2>



<p>The urinary system helps the body eliminate waste, excess water and salt. It encompasses the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Bacteria can enter any part of the system, causing an infection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="270" height="360" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/05/a-medical-illustration-of-the-urinary-system-including-kidneys-ureters-bladder-and-urethra-original.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of the urinary system, including kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra" class="wp-image-90856" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/05/a-medical-illustration-of-the-urinary-system-including-kidneys-ureters-bladder-and-urethra-original.jpg 270w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/05/a-medical-illustration-of-the-urinary-system-including-kidneys-ureters-bladder-and-urethra-original-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are UTI symptoms?</strong></h2>



<p>A UTI may cause symptoms but not always. Common symptoms are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>A strong urge to urinate.</strong> Even after using the toilet, that sensation "to go" may not go away.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>A burning or discomfort sensation while passing urine.</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Urinating often, passing small amounts of urine.</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Blood in the urine.</strong> Blood in the urine may be red, but it may look pink or brown.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cloudy-looking or strong-smelling urine.</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pelvic pain.</strong> Women, in particular, may feel pain and pressure around the pubic bone.</li>
</ul>



<p>Symptoms also may depend on which part of the urinary tract is affected. If you're feeling back or side pain, that may be from a kidney infection. If pain is in the lower belly, a bladder infection may be the culprit.</p>



<p>Especially in older adults, one effect of a UTI can be <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/delirium/symptoms-causes/syc-20371386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delirium</a>, or feeling increased confusion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are risk factors for a UTI?</strong></h2>



<p>"Typically, our immune systems are great at combating and preventing UTIs, but there are several situations and certain individuals that may be more prone to UTIs," Dr. Humphreys says.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Female anatomy:</strong> Women have greater risk of UTIs. Because a woman's urethra is shorter than a man's, bacteria can more easily enter the urinary system. Menopause also increases the risk of UTIs in women.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sexual activity:</strong> UTIs are not sexually transmitted infections, but sexual activity increases the risk for UTIs. Intercourse can cause bacteria to enter the urethra.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Some birth control methods:</strong> Diaphragms and spermicide, for example, increase the risk for UTIs.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Catheter use:</strong> Catheters may be used by people in the hospital or by those who are paralyzed or have other neurological problems that make it difficult to urinate. </li>
</ul>



<p>"A catheter is a foreign body and can serve as a highway to allow bacteria to have access to the bladder," Dr. Humphreys says.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recent urinary procedure: </strong>Urinary surgery or an exam with medical instruments can increase UTI risk.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Other health concerns:</strong> People born with urinary tract problems or those who have kidney stones, prostate issues, or suppressed immune systems are at increased risk of UTIs.</li>
</ul>



<p>With prompt treatment, UTIs rarely cause complications. But without proper treatment, UTIs can be serious. Complications may include permanent kidney damage or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sepsis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351214">sepsis</a>, which can be potentially life-threatening.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are UTI treatments? &nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>UTIs typically are treated with antibiotics. Be sure to take the medication as directed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What helps prevent UTIs?</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Drink plenty of liquids. </strong>Water consumption dilutes urine, leads to urinating more frequently and flushes bacteria.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wipe from front back.</strong> After urinating or having a bowel movement, wipe from front to back to help prevent spread of bacteria.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Urinate soon after sex.</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid potentially irritating products.</strong> Using deodorant sprays or powders in the genital area may irritate the urethra.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Switch birth control.</strong> Consider birth control methods other than a diaphragm or spermicide, for example, which can contribute to bacterial growth.</li>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>



<p>Hearing a chorus of coughs is typical at this time of year. An occasional cough is normal and healthy. A cough that persists for several weeks or brings up discolored or bloody mucus may indicate a condition that needs medical attention.</p>



<p>A cough is your body's response when something irritates your throat or airways. An irritant stimulates nerves that send a message to your brain. The brain then tells muscles in your chest and abdomen to push air out of your lungs to force out the irritant.</p>



<p>While an occasional cough is expected, a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20351575" target="_blank">cough</a>&nbsp;that persists may be a sign of a medical problem. At times, coughing can be very forceful.</p>



<p>Prolonged, vigorous coughing can irritate the lungs and cause even more coughing. It also can cause sleeplessness, dizziness or fainting,&nbsp;headaches, urinary incontinence, vomiting and even broken ribs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Acute vs. chronic cough</h2>



<p>A cough is considered "acute" if it lasts less than three weeks. Some of the causes of an acute cough include:</p>



<ul>
<li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605" target="_blank">Common cold</a></li>



<li>Influenza</li>



<li>Inhaling an irritant, such as smoke, dust, chemicals or a foreign body</li>



<li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204" target="_blank">Pneumonia</a>, which is an infection in one or both lungs</li>



<li>Whooping cough</li>
</ul>



<p>Some common causes for a "chronic" cough include:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Allergies</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asthma</a></li>



<li>Bronchitis</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</a></li>



<li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963" target="_blank">COVID-19</a></li>



<li>Croup</li>



<li>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</li>



<li>Heart failure</li>



<li>Lung cancer</li>



<li>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treating a cough</h2>



<p>Knowing when to see your healthcare team can be challenging. Usually, a benign cough will be short-lived and often associated with a runny nose or cold-like symptoms. Most of the time, those kinds of coughs will go away on their own.</p>



<p>Cough medicines are the most common antidote when the cough is acute, causes much discomfort, interferes with sleep, and is not associated with any potentially worrisome symptoms. Be sure to follow the dosing instructions on the medication.</p>



<p>To ease your cough, cough drops or hard candies may help relieve a dry cough and soothe an irritated throat. Don't give them to a child under age 6, however, because of the risk of choking. Also, consider taking a teaspoon of honey to loosen the cough.</p>



<p>Other ideas include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eating chicken noodle soup.</li>



<li>Getting plenty of rest.</li>



<li>Using a cool mist humidifier or taking a steamy shower to moisturize the air.</li>



<li>Drinking warm liquids, such as broth, tea or lemon juice, to soothe your throat.</li>



<li>Avoiding tobacco smoke.</li>
</ul>



<p>Antibiotics may not be part of the treatment plan.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/3-reasons-why-you-did-not-receive-antibiotics-from-your-provider">Antibiotics</a>&nbsp;treat bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, but they won't help viral illnesses, like colds, flu and most sore throats.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team if you start coughing up thick, green to brown sputum with fevers and chills. If you have chest pain or feel like you can't breathe, call 911.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is a cough always a sign of illness?</h2>



<p>Coughs are most notably known as a sign of a problem in your body. However, a cough can be a more straightforward issue.</p>



<p>A cough usually indicates an irritation in the lungs or the airway. The irritation triggers the nerves that connect to our brain to tell our body to try to expel it. A cough is your body's reflex of trying to get something out that's not supposed to be there.</p>



<p>If you have a new cough accompanying other symptoms like a runny nose and congestion, or if you're having fevers, you can consider wearing a mask and doing a COVID-19 test to ensure you're keeping those around you safe. If you have any other concerns, see your healthcare team to discuss them.</p>



<p>Pay attention to your cough. Although most coughs are usually minor, they can make you feel poorly. Trying the latest remedy is tempting, but the best thing you can do is take care of yourself. Rest, drink fluids and keep the air around you moist. Also, remember to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ws-of-healthy-hands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wash your hands</a>&nbsp;frequently.</p>

<p>Many women often don't show any signs of cervical cancer in the early stages of the disease. In advanced stages, symptoms may include vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or pain during intercourse.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/butler-kristina-a-m-d-m-s/bio-20110364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kristina Butler</a>, a Mayo Clinic gynecologic oncologist, explains why preventive screenings are crucial.</p>

<p>Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the cells of the cervix. Women who have been exposed to HPV are most at risk. Routine Pap smears or HPV screenings can help detect precancerous cells.</p>



<p>"We recommend cervical cancer screening start at age 21 for most women and continue thereafter about every three to five years, depending on the type of screening that's performed. Annual pelvic exams are offered in the years a Pap smear is not due," says Dr. Butler.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cervical cancer screening recommendations for older women</h3>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women receive a Pap smear until age 65.</p>



<p>"We do know that 16% of cervical cancers happen in women above the age of 65," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>She says it's important for women with high risk factors or postmenopausal women to continue regular screenings.</p>



<p>"Particularly if a woman has abnormal bleeding, or any bleeding after menopause, it's very relevant to be evaluated," explains Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>Practicing safe sex and getting the HPV vaccine can reduce your risk of cervical cancer. People can get vaccinated between the ages of 9 and 45.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>A Rochester resident's triumph over tennis elbow through percutaneous hydrotenotomy&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>A couple of years ago, Sara Stenhaug began experiencing debilitating right elbow pain, commonly known as tennis elbow. Physical therapy and dry needling failed to provide the desired relief, leaving Sara frustrated and challenged by the persistent symptoms. She found it difficult to continue with daily activities like exercise, crafting and cooking. Even simple tasks like opening the window blinds were painful. Each day brought pain and frustration. Driven by the desire to regain functionality and return to a beloved pastime — pickleball, Sara reached out to Mayo Clinic for a solution.</p>



<p>Seeking a solution to her pain and wanting to return to her favorite sport, Sara was referred to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/konidis-jane-m-d/bio-20508998">Dr. Jane Konidis, </a>a physician in Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/physical-medicine-rehabilitation-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20467039">Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, </a>who suggested a percutaneous hydrotenotomy, also known as TenJet. The procedure, performed on July 13, proved to be less invasive than traditional methods, did not require anesthesia and provided an almost miraculously immediate relief from her pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The hardest thing about the recovery wasn't that I was in pain. I had no pain,” says Sara. "The mental aspect of recovery was a lot harder than the physical for me because I had no pain.&nbsp;I knew I had to gradually build up strength over time for long-term healing. It was difficult for me to set strict boundaries around my recovery plan because I just wanted to get back to playing pickleball."</p>



<p>Working with Dr. Konidis and Mark Jensen, her physical therapist, Sara developed a post-procedure exercise plan, changing pickleball to biking, and high-intensity workouts to hiking and walking. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of financial considerations, Sara noted that while platelet-rich plasma and shockwave procedures also were recommended, they required out-of-pocket expenses. The TenJet procedure, on the other hand, was covered by insurance, making it a more accessible option for her and other patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sara, a retired teacher and active member of the community in Rochester, Minnesota, expresses gratitude for the support she received. "Dr. Konidis is very intelligent, obviously knows what she's talking about and can easily spell it all out. I think I was in and out in 40 minutes. It was all just great," she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now six months since her procedure, Sara has returned to the pickleball court. While the pace of play is a little less intense, Sara is extremely grateful to resume a pain-free, active lifestyle. As she continues her journey toward building up strength, she enthusiastically advocates for the TenJet procedure, urging others confronting similar challenges to consider this innovative approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Knowing what I know now, would I do it again? Absolutely," she says. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What does it take to make meaningful, lasting lifestyle changes? Some may argue it takes a fair amount of willpower to develop new habits, but a person can't rely on willpower alone. </p>

<p>What is willpower? Merriam-Webster defines it as the ability to control one's own actions, emotions or urges.</p>



<p>When it comes to pushing away the potato chips and picking up the walking pace, it's easier said than done. Dr. Donald Hensrud often hears from patients that they don't have the willpower to undertake weight management.</p>



<p>"I think everybody has willpower. It's not a matter of willpower, there are powerful forces causing us to eat more and to do less activity," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>It's a matter of coming up with strategies to deal with the challenges.</p>



<p>"... and these strategies need to be practical, realistic and enjoyable enough to be sustainable. We can't just not eat. We have to eat. Nobody has perfect habits," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>He says coming up with strategies to eat healthy, low-calorie, nutrient-dense foods can be a way to game the system, and not just rely on willpower.</p>



<p>"That usually doesn't work in the long term," he says. "It's a matter of changing habits and coming up with new lifestyle changes that will fit the bill and help us manage our weight as we move along."</p>



<p>Dr. Hensrud says it's important to be kind to yourself too, and to ask yourself if you are ready for the challenge.</p>

<p>EAU CLAIRE, Wis. — Sleep might not be at the top of the list when you think about ways to boost your athletic performance. But it's just as important as your training program, nutrition and hydration.</p>



<p><strong>Why does sleep play such a crucial role not only for performance but also for overall health?</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="280" height="280" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/amy-rantala-md.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379845" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/amy-rantala-md.jpg 280w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/amy-rantala-md-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Amy Rantala</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"When you sleep, your brain processes all the information you've taken in during the day," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/amy-rantala-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Rantala, M.D.</a>, a sports medicine physician at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire</a>. "Sleep filters out and deletes some information, while storing other information in memory. That includes assimilating new skills or techniques you may have learned that day so they become an intuitive part of your sports performance."</p>



<p>As you push your body to be stronger, go faster and be more agile, your tissues undergo continual wear and tear. Sleep provides your body time and energy to repair the wear and tear. Because your body has undergone these repair sessions, you're less likely to be injured. You're also less likely to become ill because sleep strengthens your immune system.</p>



<p>Studies of collegiate athletes show that when they don't get enough sleep, their reaction times and accuracy decrease. One study focusing on basketball free throws and three-pointers found that sleep-deprived athletes can see a drop of 50% in accuracy. With 10 or more hours of sleep, accuracy can increase by 10%. That's a 60% potential difference in performance.</p>



<p>Getting enough sleep also helps with your mental health and resiliency. The&nbsp;National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)&nbsp;has added sleep screening to its best practices to monitor for conditions like insomnia and sleep apnea.</p>



<p><strong>How much sleep is enough?&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>So, what is adequate sleep? It depends on your age and stage of life:</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Children</strong><br>Kids 6–12 should get nine to 12 hours of sleep.</li>



<li><strong>Teens</strong><br>Young people ages 13–18 should get eight to 10 hours of sleep.</li>



<li><strong>Adults</strong><br>Those older than 18 need seven or more hours of sleep.</li>
</ul>



<p>Teenage student athletes face numerous challenges to achieve that sweet spot of eight to 10 hours of sleep, including the demands of training, the times when games and practices are held, school, work, and social and family time.</p>



<p>"During the teen years, the body undergoes a change in the natural sleep-wake cycle, known as circadian rhythm," Dr. Rantala says. "Teens tend to stay up later at night and sleep later in the morning. That's why those early morning practices can play havoc with a teen's sleep reservoir and influence a student athlete's mental and physical health."</p>



<p><strong>Tips for getting a good night's sleep</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Just like a training routine sets you up for athletic success, a bedtime routine sets you up for sleep success.</p>



<p><strong>An effective sleep routine includes:</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Avoiding vigorous exercise, training or competitions one to two hours before bedtime.</li>



<li>Holding off on large meals, alcohol and caffeine too late in the evening.</li>



<li>Creating a sleep-friendly environment. Your bedroom should be quiet, dark, relaxing and cool. Your mind and body should understand, "This is where I sleep."</li>



<li>Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.</li>



<li>Setting aside at least 20 to 30 minutes before bedtime to wind down. That includes turning off all electronics and screens, such as phones, tablets and TVs. Instead, dim the lights, set out your clothes for the next day, write in your journal or do other quiet activities.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>What if I still have trouble sleeping?</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Daily life is full of stressors that can sabotage your best attempts to establish a healthy sleep routine. One of those stressors may be a wearable device tracking your sleep. If you're sleep deprived, seeing regular reminders of your lack of sleep can be stressful.</p>



<p>"Having a good support network of family, friends, coaches and teammates to talk with can help you cope with stress," Dr. Rantala says. "If sleep still is elusive, consider counseling, which may include cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, meditation and journaling."</p>



<p>Just like learning and gaining proficiency in your sport takes practice, so does getting a good night's sleep. The sleep habits you develop and practice now will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>Starting a workout program or being physically active takes motivation and commitment. The key is to start slowly and do something you take pleasure in.</p>



<p>"If you hate swimming, don't try to start to become a swimmer. But (if) you enjoy dancing or other activities (such as) gardening, those are forms of activity that once you engage in, you increase your consistency and compliance that will have the most health benefits," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>

<p>Being active can build muscle strength and improve cognitive and cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>"Three percent or 30 minutes a day of our waking hours, if we commit that to physical activity, will have huge benefits," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>And for those young at heart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.</p>



<p>"As we get older, dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips to get started and stick with a workout plan:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Research workout routines.</li>



<li>Schedule your workouts.</li>



<li>Find an exercise buddy.</li>



<li>Be consistent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is your refrigerator holding onto holiday leftovers? It's OK to let them go.</p>



<p>"What we want to do is, if we have any remaining food items or beverages that lingered after the holidays, we want to get rid of them," she says.</p>

<p>Either throw leftovers away or slowly eat them in smaller <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1">por</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tions</a>.</p>



<p>"We also want to slowly regress back to our old habits. Start introducing vegetables and fruits with most meals," says Delgado.</p>



<p>And pay attention to your food portion sizes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We don't necessarily have to go on a diet. We don't necessarily have to eliminate all of our foods. We just want to look at the portion sizes and the frequency that we have these foods," she says.</p>



<p>Opt for lean protein, whole grains and fresh produce in your diet, still allowing for an occasional treat.</p>



<p>"With nutrition, there is no all or nothing. We can still enjoy those nice treats, those good desserts, those savory beverages. It's all in how much and how often we are having them," says Delgado.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reset your eating habits with portion control</h3>



<p>Simplify your portion control by dividing your plate into three sections. This can assist you in making healthier food choices and managing your portions more effectively.</p>



<ul>
<li>One-half: fruit and nonstarchy vegetables</li>



<li>One-quarter: whole grains</li>



<li>One-quarter: protein-rich foods, such as legumes, fish or lean meats</li>
</ul>
