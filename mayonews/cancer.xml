"We know that 250,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer every year, and 40,000 women die from&nbsp;breast cancer each year.

<p>She adds, “It is important to talk with your&nbsp;doctor about what age and frequency of mammogram screening is right for you. You may need additional imaging in conjunction with mammograms, based on your breast cancer risk."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has long recommended breast cancer screening begin at age 40.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Breast cancer screening options</h2>



<p>Traditional mammograms produce 2D images of the breast, while newer 3D mammograms, also called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/3d-mammogram/about/pac-20438708?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast tomosynthesis</a>, create 3D images. Many medical facilities now offer both for breast cancer screening.</p>



<p>3D mammograms help detect breast cancer and investigate issues like masses and pain. They're especially useful for women with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-does-a-diagnosis-of-dense-breasts-mean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense breast</a> tissue. These machines create both 3D and standard 2D images during screening, providing a more thorough assessment.</p>



<p>It's important you talk with your healthcare team about your <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/assessing-breast-cancer-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">risk</a> for breast cancer and the benefits, risks and limitations of screening options. In addition, discuss all changes to your breasts you notice and ask about an appropriate screening schedule for you.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My mom had a pap smear recently, and the results came back as abnormal. After further testing, we were shocked when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She didn't have any symptoms. Now, her healthcare team is discussing surgery and medications. What should I know about her illness? As her daughter, should I be worried about myself? Most importantly, how I can support her during treatment?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> I commend you for finding ways to support your mom through her <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical cancer</a> diagnosis. Gathering reliable information about her illness and treatment is a great start.</p>



<p>Part of the reproductive system, the cervix connects the vagina to the uterus, also known as the womb. By collecting cervical cells (called the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap smear</a> after the scientist who pioneered the screening test in the mid-1900s), cancer can be detected even at an early stage.</p>



<p>While cervical cancer may cause symptoms of bleeding or pain, it often does not cause any symptoms, especially in early stages. That's why Pap smears typically are recommended every three years for women ages 21 to 65. For women who are 30 and up, Pap smears may be recommended every five years, combined with testing for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV infection</a>. Pelvic examination with assessment of the cervix and other gynecologic structures, such as the vagina, vulva, urethra, anus, uterus and ovaries, can be easily performed in years when a Pap smear is not due.</p>



<p>HPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer. It is a frequent viral infection transmitted sexually through skin-to-skin contact. To help protect from cancer in the future, an <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-protecting-kids-from-cancer-with-hpv-vaccine/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">HPV vaccine</a> is available for males and females starting at ages 9 to 11. The vaccine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for people ages 9 to 45.</p>



<p>Treatment for cervical cancer will depend on many factors. For early-stage cervical cancer, a surgery called a total <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/abdominal-hysterectomy/about/pac-20384559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hysterectomy</a> to remove the cervix and uterus may be considered. A hysterectomy may be performed through a cut in the lower part of the belly. Or a hysterectomy can be done through a cut in the vagina. Minimally invasive procedures, such as with robotic-assisted or laparoscopic surgery using long, thin surgical instruments passed through small cuts in the belly also are options.</p>



<p>However, removing the uterus means pregnancy no longer is possible. Some surgical procedures, such as a trachelectomy (cervix removal), can preserve the uterus and fertility options.</p>



<p>For cervical cancer that has advanced but has not spread to other parts of the body, chemotherapy and radiation — delivered internally, externally or both — are typically recommended.</p>



<p>Medications are available for advanced cervical cancer that is continuing, keeps coming back or has spread. Targeted therapy called bevacizumab&nbsp;often is used in combination with other medicines. For patients who test positive for PD-L1 — a type of protein that stops the immune system from attacking cancer — an immunotherapy called pembrolizumab also may be used.</p>



<p>So-called "second-line treatments," such as tisotumab vedotin-tftv, given after earlier treatments have been unsuccessful, also are available and showing improved overall response rate.</p>



<p>While all treatments have benefits and risks, these treatments hold promise for enhanced long-term outcomes for patients with advanced and recurrent cervical cancer.</p>



<p>No matter what treatment plan your mom pursues with her care team, you can help in a variety of ways, such as doing household chores like cooking or cleaning. Your mom may appreciate you going to her medical appointments to ask questions, take notes or be another person to process all the information.</p>



<p>Don't forget prevention measures to reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ask your healthcare team about an appropriate Pap test routine for you depending on your age and individual factors.</li>



<li>Consider the HPV vaccine. The HPV vaccine is approved by the FDA to age 45. Are you up to date on your vaccines?</li>



<li>If you are sexually active, practice safe sex by using condoms and limiting sexual partners.</li>



<li>If you smoke, work hard to <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-strategies-to-quit-smoking/">quit</a>. Your healthcare team can point you to a variety of resources to stop tobacco use. Research shows women who smoke are twice as likely to get cervical cancer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC</strong>: I have been diagnosed with a brain tumor and advised to have radiation therapy. I'm very nervous about this and the risks for me, my family and, potentially, another cancer diagnosis. Can you explain why radiation therapy could be right for me?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Radiation therapy has been used to treat cancer since the beginning of the 20th century. This type of treatment continues to be one of the most effective treatments for cancerous (malignant) and noncancerous (benign) brain tumors. How it is delivered — and the technology used — has continued to evolve and improve.</p>



<p>Most patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain tumors</a> receive one of two types of radiation: <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/radiation-therapy/external-beam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">external beam radiation</a>, in which the tumor is treated over the course of several weeks, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stereotactic-radiosurgery/about/pac-20384526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiosurgery</a>, in which patients receive a high dose of radiation in one to five treatments to destroy the tumor.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stereotactic-radiosurgery/about/pac-20384526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stereotactic radiosurgery</a> uses 3D imaging to target high doses of radiation to the tumor with minimal impact on surrounding healthy tissue. It is used in small cancerous and noncancerous tumors and can be delivered in a few ways:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brain-stereotactic-radiosurgery/about/pac-20384679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamma Knife</a>: A Gamma Knife is not a knife at all but rather many tiny beams of radiation focused on a tumor with extreme accuracy.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linear accelerator</a>: A linear accelerator aims high-energy beams to a precise point on the body.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491#:~:text=Proton%20therapy%20is%20beneficial%20in,spine%2C%20and%20many%20pediatric%20cancers." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proton beam</a>: Using positively charged particles in atoms, proton therapy is focused on the tumor; virtually none of the radiation exits beyond the tumor.</li>
</ul>



<p>Radiosurgery targets each tumor individually and helps to spare normal tissue from being treated with radiation.</p>



<p>When I speak to patients, I often highlight several advantages of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation therapy</a>:</p>



<p><strong>Radiation treatment plans are tailored to each patient.<br></strong>Radiation therapy is not one-size-fits-all. The volume, dose, type and duration of radiation are tailored to fit each person and their specific tumor. A treatment plan is designed that considers the size, location and type of your brain tumor. Radiation therapy can be used to treat brain tumors by itself or after surgery, to ensure that leftover cancer cells are destroyed.</p>



<p><strong>Better precision.</strong><br>Radiation therapy must be accurately delivered to successfully destroy the tumor and prevent the tumor from coming back. Improvements made over the years — including improved imaging to better target the tumor and align the patient during radiation treatment — allow us to minimize damage to surrounding tissues and organs. Today, the accuracy with which we can deliver the treatment is within millimeters, thus limiting excess exposure of healthy tissues to radiation.</p>



<p>Better precision has allowed for a newer approach in radiation therapy, known as <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/search/results?swKeyword=hypofractionated+radiation+therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypofractionated stereotactic</a> radiotherapy, which delivers high doses of radiation over two to five days to destroy the tumor.</p>



<p>For instance, larger brain tumors have been difficult to treat with radiosurgery as the risk of treatment increases with the size of the tumor. However, research has shown that if we spread that dose over two to five days instead of one day, the tolerance is better, and we can often achieve a more effective dose for larger tumors.</p>



<p>Though side effects from brain radiation vary, fatigue and hair loss are the most reported. However, most patients find they can continue their regular activities throughout treatment.</p>



<p><strong>Improved safety.<br></strong>A common misconception when patients hear the word radiation is that radiation will cause cancer. While that is possible, the risk of developing a second cancer from radiation is extremely low. Modern radiation therapy techniques have improved effectiveness and safety, and radiation oncologists continue to discover ways to limit exposure and reduce the risk of secondary cancers from radiation.</p>



<p>It is important to note that if a secondary cancer were to occur from radiation therapy, it would not likely develop until many years after radiation exposure. Also, the risk of developing secondary cancer decreases with time, according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/survivorship/long-term-health-concerns/second-cancers-in-adults/treatment-risks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>.</p>



<p>Another misconception is that radiation therapy can pose a risk to people around you. External beam radiation passes right through the body like an X-ray. Patients do not leave their treatments radioactive. You will not expose anyone to radiation by receiving this type of treatment.</p>



<p>Radiation therapy continues to evolve through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/radiation-oncology/sections/research/rsc-20188600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> conducted by Mayo Clinic and others. In addition to advances in machinery, imaging has improved to help guide more accurate radiation treatment for patients.— <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/peterson-jennifer-l-m-d/bio-20055474" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Jennifer Peterson, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

They even worked out a healthy eating plan, and you want to stick to it. And you do well for many days, but then something upsetting happens, and your first thought is food.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047342?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emotional eating</a> is eating to suppress or soothe negative emotions, such as stress, anger, fear, boredom, sadness and loneliness. Food also can be a distraction. If you're worried about an upcoming event or stewing over a conflict, for instance, you may focus on eating comfort food instead of dealing with the painful situation. </p>



<p>Emotional eating often leads to eating too much, especially overeating foods that are sweet, fatty and high in calories. And this can sabotage your weight-loss efforts. </p>



<p>When negative emotions threaten to trigger emotional eating, try these nine tips to stay on track:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Keep a food diary.<br></strong>Write down what you eat, how much you eat, when you eat, how you're feeling when you eat and how hungry you are. Over time, you might see patterns that reveal the connection between mood and food.</li><li><strong>Tame your stress.<br></strong>If stress contributes to your emotional eating, try a stress management technique, such as yoga, meditation or deep breathing.</li><li><strong>Have a hunger reality check.<br></strong>Is your hunger physical or emotional? If you ate just a few hours ago and don't have a rumbling stomach, you're probably not hungry. Give the craving time to pass.</li><li><strong>Get support.<br></strong>You're more likely to give in to emotional eating if you lack a good support network. Lean on family and friends, or consider joining a support group.</li><li><strong>Fight boredom.<br></strong>Instead of snacking when you're not hungry, distract yourself and substitute a healthier behavior. Take a walk, watch a movie, play with your pet, listen to music, read, surf the internet or call a friend.</li><li><strong>Remove temptation.<br></strong>Don't keep hard-to-resist comfort foods in your home. And if you feel angry or blue, postpone your trip to the grocery store until your emotions are in check.</li><li><strong>Don't deprive yourself.<br></strong>When trying to lose weight, you might limit calories too much, eat the same foods repeatedly and banish treats. This may just increase your food cravings, especially in response to emotions. Eat satisfying amounts of healthier foods, enjoy an occasional treat and get plenty of variety to curb cravings.</li><li><strong>Snack healthy.<br></strong>If you feel the urge to eat between meals, choose a healthy snack, such as fresh fruit, vegetables with low-fat dip, nuts or unbuttered popcorn. Or try lower-calorie versions of your favorite foods to see if they satisfy your craving.</li><li><strong>Learn from setbacks.<br></strong>If you have an episode of emotional eating, forgive yourself and start fresh the next day. Try to learn from the experience and plan for how you can prevent it in the future. Focus on the positive changes you're making in your eating habits and give yourself credit for making changes that will lead to better health.</li></ul>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note:&nbsp;</strong>April is Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month.</em></p>



<p>Esophageal cancer accounts for only about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/esophagus-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1% of new cancer cases</a>&nbsp;in the U.S., far lower than rates in other parts of the world. However, survival rates are low because it is often found at a later stage when symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, worsening heartburn, coughing and hoarseness have begun.</p>



<p>Having precancerous changes in the cells of the esophagus, a condition called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/barretts-esophagus/symptoms-causes/syc-20352841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barrett's esophagus</a>&nbsp;is a risk factor for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esophageal cancer</a>. Barrett's esophagus is caused by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>&nbsp;(GERD), which occurs when stomach acid repeatedly flows back into the esophagus, irritating the lining of the esophagus.</p>



<p>Risk factors for&nbsp;Barrett's esophagus include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Having a family history of Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer.</li>



<li>Being male.</li>



<li>Being white.</li>



<li>Being older than 50.</li>



<li>Having chronic heartburn and acid reflux.</li>



<li>Being a smoker or former smoker.</li>



<li>Being overweight.</li>

<p></p>



<p>Esophageal cancer specialists recommend screening for Barrett's esophagus in people who have multiple risk factors. Screening involves a procedure called an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopy/about/pac-20395197?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endoscopy</a>. During an endoscopy, a healthcare professional passes a lighted tube with a camera at the end (endoscope) down your throat to check for signs of changing esophagus tissue.</p>



<p>Despite these recommendations, screening rates for Barrett's esophagus are low.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/iyer-prasad-g-m-d-m-s/bio-20054859?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prasad Iyer, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and researcher, is working to change that.</p>



<p>"We now have access to new, minimally invasive tools for Barrett's esophagus screening," he says. "However, there is a critical need to develop more accurate Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer risk assessment tools that can be easily used with electronic health record data."</p>



<p>Such tools would help healthcare professionals identify people most likely to benefit from screening.</p>



<p>To address this need, Dr. Iyer and a team of researchers developed and tested a tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the risk of&nbsp;Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer&nbsp;based on data from a large database of de-identified electronic health records. The results of their study were published in&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/ctg/fulltext/2023/10000/development_of_electronic_health_record_based.6.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology</a>&nbsp;in 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the study was conducted</h2>



<p>Dr. Iyer and his research team used an AI model developed based on de-identified&nbsp;electronic health records of 6 million Mayo Clinic patients to create a risk prediction tool that can determine&nbsp;Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer&nbsp;risk at least a year before diagnosis.</p>



<p>The risk prediction tool can be integrated with an electronic health record and, when appropriate, prompt a healthcare professional to consider screening a patient for Barrett's esophagus.</p>



<p>Based on clinical, endoscopy, laboratory and pathology notes in the electronic health records, the researchers identified 8,476 people with&nbsp;Barrett's esophagus, 1,539 people with&nbsp;esophageal cancer and 252,276 people in the control group. They then used these groups to develop predictive models for the risk prediction tool.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The study results</h2>



<p>The results of the study demonstrated that the tool's predictive models had a high level of accuracy:</p>



<ul>
<li>The tool predicted Barrett's esophagus with 76% sensitivity (proportion of samples correctly identified as negative), 76% specificity (proportion of samples correctly identified as positive), and an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUROC) of 0.84. AUROC is a metric used to measure the quality of predictions produced by an AI model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest quality.</li>



<li>The tool predicted esophageal cancer with 84% sensitivity, 70% specificity and an AUROC of 0.84.</li>



<li>The tool also identified known risk factors for Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer, as well as new risk factors to consider, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/triglycerides/art-20048186https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triglyceride</a>&nbsp;levels and electrolyte levels.</li>

<p></p>



<p>"This tool could be integrated into the&nbsp;electronic health record&nbsp;and combined with a minimally invasive (nonendoscopic) screening tool and used by healthcare professionals in primary care," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Iyer notes that more research is needed to clarify when healthcare professionals should recommend screening, as well as to clarify other details. "Testing this risk prediction tool in patients and assessing the tool's performance are important next steps," he says.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma is a type of cancer affecting glial cells, which connect nerve cells and support brain function.</p>



<p>"It tends to be a tumor that also tends to grow and invade the brain," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/quinones-hinojosa-alfredo-m-d/bio-20238939?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa</a>, a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic. "Sometimes it can be slow and steady, but it tends to grow very fast."</p>



<p>Despite significant advances in surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation technology, the prognosis of glioblastoma remains poor.</p>



<p>“The median survival of patients with the best therapies tends to be between 12 and 14 months,” says Dr. Quinones-Hinojosa.</p>



<p>There is no known cure for glioblastoma, but treatments may help slow the progression or help stabilize the quality of life. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/brain-tumor-stem-cell-research/overview?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a> is making strides, giving patients more options and hope.</p>



<p>“Research is crucial to find hope and healing on every corner of our operating room, in every corner of our laboratory, and to connect those two, ultimately, through our patients," says Dr. Quinones-Hinojosa.</p>

<p>April is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aacr.org/patients-caregivers/awareness-months/esophageal-cancer-awareness-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month</a>, which makes this good time to learn the signs of esophageal cancer and what you can do to reduce your risk.</p>



<p>Approximately 21,560 new cases of esophageal cancer ― 17,030 in men and 4,530&nbsp;in women ― will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year, and 16,120 people ― 12,920 men and 3,200 women ― will die from the disease, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/esophagus-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356084?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Esophageal cancer</a>&nbsp;usually begins in the cells that line the inside of the esophagus ― a long, hollow tube that runs from your throat to your stomach. Your esophagus helps move the food you swallow from the back of your throat to your stomach to be digested. Esophageal cancer is more common among men than women, and it can occur anywhere along the esophagus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Signs and symptoms of esophageal cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>



<li>Weight loss without trying</li>



<li>Chest pain, pressure or burning</li>



<li>Worsening indigestion or heartburn</li>



<li>Coughing or hoarseness</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Reducing your risk</strong></h2>



<p>Here are four steps you can take to reduce your risk of esophageal cancer:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Quit smoking</strong>.<br>If you smoke, talk to your health care professional about&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-strategies-to-quit-smoking/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategies for quitting</a>. If you don't use tobacco, don't start.</li>



<li><strong>Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all</strong>.<br>If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.</li>



<li><strong>Eat more fruits and vegetables</strong>.<br>Add a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to your diet.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight</strong>.<br>If you are overweight or obese, talk to your health care professional about strategies to help you lose weight. Aim for a slow and steady weight loss of 1 or 2 pounds per week.</li>
</ul>

<p>When Walter "Dick" Whetstone leaves his home in central South Carolina, he's usually wearing a paw print or, at the least, his school colors of orange and purple. The proud Clemson University alumnus didn't realize that what he wore to an appointment would earn him a nickname and a chance to help others.</p>



<p>In late 2020, Dick began losing weight. At first, it was on purpose, as he was making diet and exercise adjustments to keep up with his grandchildren. But when the changes stopped, and his weight continued to drop, he went to his family doctor for answers.</p>



<p>Tests confirmed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic cancer</a>, and by July 2021, Dick was receiving chemotherapy in South Carolina. Doctors estimated he had four to six months to live.</p>



<p>"I remember asking my wife for a piece of paper so I could write down who would be pallbearers at my funeral," Dick says.</p>



<p>Complications from an open-heart surgery several years earlier led him to experience cardiac arrest four times during treatment. He explained that surgery to remove a tumor was called off in the operating room and that the physician recommended palliative care.</p>



<p>"If I'm going down, I'm going down fighting," Dick says.</p>



<p>That's when he began researching options for pancreatic cancer treatment. He found information about Mayo Clinic and called the operator.</p>



<p>"Within 10 days of me calling the number, I had connected with the care team at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> and was in Jacksonville for tests and appointments," Dick says. "Within the month, I was preparing for surgery."</p>



<p>He packed a Clemson polo for luck and to show his school spirit. The paw print became a conversation piece when Dick met <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/stauffer-john-a-m-d/bio-20055448?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. John Stauffer</a> for his preoperative appointment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385834" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture2.jpg 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Dick received an autographed football from his alma mater in 2021 while undergoing chemotherapy.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"Dr. Stauffer walked in the room, saw my shirt and asked, 'Are you one of those Tigers?'" Dick recalls. "We talked about how he was an Ohio State graduate, and before I left, he nicknamed me 'Tiger.'"</p>



<p>Schedulers found an earlier surgery option for Dick so he didn't have to commute home and back to Florida. When he was brought into the operating room, the words he exchanged with Dr. Stauffer are ones he'll remember for the rest of his life.</p>



<p>"He came up to me and said, 'Tiger, we're all on the same side today. I'll see you on the other side,'" Dick says.</p>



<p>The procedure was successful. In addition to removing cancerous tissue, his care team, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/may-byron-c-m-d/bio-20138357?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Byron May</a>, delivered intraoperative radiation therapy using a mobile linear accelerator. Dr. May explains that radiation was the best approach because several critical arteries and veins supplying the liver, stomach and intestines cannot be removed, but are often affected by pancreatic cancer.</p>



<p>"Dr. Stauffer and I confer on each patient, determining the precise target zone to be safely irradiated, and follow that plan once the surgical team has removed as much of the cancerous tissue as possible," Dr. May says. "This teamwork and collaboration before, during and after surgery assures maximal success for our patient."</p>



<p>Motivated to get back to his family, Dick started walking with his nurses around the halls. For a patient Dick's age, hospital stays after surgery range from 15 to 18 days. Dick exceeded expectations and was cleared by his team after five days.</p>



<p>In the time since his procedure at Mayo Clinic, Dick has worked toward renewing his pilot's license — once a dream he thought was gone due to his health. He spends more time with his family, including his grandchildren; working outside; and he's shared his journey with dozens of people in his community who have been diagnosed with cancer.</p>

<p>"Looking back, I could have given up a hundred times," Dick says. "When I started speaking with patients, I tell them, 'It's going to be rough, and you're going to want to quit — don't. Stay hopeful and determined.' That's been my message to 50 people over the last three years."</p>



<p>He often thinks about his conversation with Dr. Stauffer just before his procedure about being on the same team.</p>



<p>"It's an incredible feeling to know a group of people, who are focused on helping you and making you well again, and who say, 'We're all on the same team,' Dick says. "It's an amazing place to be."</p>

<p>April is <a href="https://www.aacr.org/patients-caregivers/awareness-months/head-and-neck-cancer-awareness-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Cancer Awareness Month</a>, which makes this a good time to learn about four types of cancer that affect these areas of the body.</p>



<p>Head and neck cancers account for nearly 4% of all cancers in the U.S., according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/head-and-neck/head-neck-fact-sheet#how-common-are-head-and-neck-cancers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a>. These cancers are more than twice as common among men as women, and are diagnosed more often among people over 50.</p>



<p>Among the many types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/symptoms-causes/syc-20354171?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head and neck cancers</a> are these four:</p>



<p><strong>Esthesioneuroblastoma</strong></p>



<p>This is a rare type of cancer that begins in the upper portion of the nasal cavity. The area where <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esthesioneuroblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351075?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esthesioneuroblastoma</a> begins is separated from the brain by a bone that contains tiny holes that allow the nerves that control the sense of smell to pass through. Esthesioneuroblastoma also is called olfactory neuroblastoma.<br><br>Signs and symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma include loss of sense of smell, frequent nosebleeds and difficulty breathing through the nostrils as the tumor grows.</p>



<p><strong>Lip cancer</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lip-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355079?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lip cancer</a> can occur anywhere along the upper or lower lip, but it's most common on the lower lip. Risk factors include excessive sun exposure and tobacco use, particularly pipe smoking. You can reduce your risk of lip cancer by protecting your face from the sun with a hat or sunblock, and by quitting smoking.<br><br>Signs and symptoms of lip cancer include a flat or slightly raised whitish discoloration of the lip; a sore on the lip that won’t heal; and tingling, pain or numbness of the lips or the skin around the mouth.</p>



<p><strong>Nasal and paranasal tumors</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nasal-paranasal-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20354136?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nasal and paranasal tumors</a> are abnormal growths that begin in and around the passageway within your nose. Risk factors include smoking and being around people who are smoking, air pollution and long-term exposure to chemicals and irritants, and HPV infection.<br><br>Signs and symptoms of nasal and paranasal tumors include difficulty breathing through the nose, loss of sense of smell, nosebleeds, and facial swelling or pain.</p>



<p><strong>Throat cancer</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Throat cancer</a> can develop in the throat or voice box. Risk factors include tobacco use; excessive alcohol use; and viral infections, including HPV and Epstein-Barr virus.<br><br>Signs and symptoms of throat cancer include a cough; changes in the voice, such as hoarseness or not speaking clearly; difficulty swallowing; and ear or throat pain.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers used a new approach to chemotherapy to more than double the typical survival rate for patients with stomach cancer and peritoneal metastasis, which is cancer that has spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity, according to a study published in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1245/s10434-023-14379-2?sharing_token=izzkP9mkEzSjWxeG7Xa9dFR9MmLxJfDmU1c3CqwK5f3wLUJQhSLmLagY2QEynd9jmkArmVywnDHLt0EcA8r2PM76wCtckV8vTgboUgXYD6HGWsZqNVRJ5kCkxmtcHBsF3rDL2hyp5moyFyBa8G0_AfEIc_Zkj6srGmyuHe95P4g=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annals of Surgical Oncology.</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stomach-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stomach cancer</a>, which is also called gastric cancer, is caused by an uncontrolled growth of cells that starts in the stomach. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease has spread beyond the stomach and a cure is less likely.</p>



<p>"We're seeing an increase in stomach cancer in younger people, and it tends to be more advanced," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grotz-travis-e-m-d/bio-20342285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Grotz, M.D.</a>, surgical oncologist. “Unfortunately, when stomach cancer spreads to the peritoneum, systemic therapy is the primary treatment, resulting in only one year to live on average. Our research team was determined to improve outcomes for these patients so they can have more time with their family and friends."</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Grotz_Travis_E._14925036_202207141044.jpg" alt="Image of Travis Grotz, M.D." class="wp-image-385206" style="width:200px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Grotz_Travis_E._14925036_202207141044.jpg 640w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Grotz_Travis_E._14925036_202207141044-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Grotz, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the study, the patients received cytoreductive surgery to remove all visible cancer tumors in the stomach and abdominal cavity, followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). During HIPEC, the abdominal cavity is bathed with hot chemotherapy drugs, in this case cisplatin and paclitaxel, for 90 minutes to kill any remaining microscopic cancer cells. Heating the chemotherapy drugs and administering them directly into the abdominal cavity allows for both a higher dosage and greater penetration of the chemotherapy, resulting in more cancer cells being destroyed than conventional treatment, say the researchers.</p>



<p>"The median survival for most stage 4 gastric cancer patients is around 13 months," says Dr. Grotz, who is lead author of the study. "By using this new combination of chemotherapy drugs during hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, more than half (55%) of our patients are still alive three years after surgery."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/HIPEC-illustration16x9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385327" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/HIPEC-illustration16x9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/HIPEC-illustration16x9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>The patients studied were ages 46-62 with stage 4 gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis. They received an average of seven cycles of chemotherapy prior to undergoing cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. After the procedure, the patients stayed in the hospital for around six days, with most patients having no complications. Of the patients who had complications, most were lower grade and didn't prolong their hospital stay.</p>



<p>Researchers followed the patients clinically with imaging and tumor markers every three to four months for the first two years and every six months thereafter. The one, two and three-year overall survival rates were 96%, 78% and 55%, respectively.</p>



<p>The research team is looking to improve those outcomes even further by performing similar procedures robotically to require smaller abdominal incisions. The goal is to decrease the length of hospital stays and complication rates and quicken recovery so patients can get back to enjoying their lives. Eventually, Dr. Grotz hopes to do the procedure even sooner after diagnosis to prevent the spread of stomach cancer to the peritoneum.</p>



<p>"People with gastric cancer are usually told they have no hope and no options. When I was a medical student, I was motivated to wholly understand the cancer, how to treat it to really make a meaningful impact and cure some of these patients or prolong their survival or help alleviate their symptoms," says Dr. Grotz. "Although we still have a long way to go, we've made some big strides and will continue to make progress to provide hope and healing for our patients."</p>
