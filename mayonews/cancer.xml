<p>Melissa Neuman dreaded getting mammograms. Her small, dense breasts made the screening exceptionally uncomfortable and painful. So Melissa put off getting an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/mammography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual mammogram</a>&nbsp;until she felt she couldn't delay any longer.</p>



<p>For about five years, Melissa had been plagued with a nagging pain just under her left breast. In February 2023, a recommendation from a friend led her to seek care from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jessica-johnson-np" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Johnson</a>, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/obstetrics-and-gynecology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OB-GYN</a>&nbsp;nurse practitioner with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/owatonna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Owatonna</a>, Minnesota.</p>



<p>"She took me seriously, was curious and determined to find out what was causing the pain," says Melissa, who lives in Owatonna and works as an activities assistant at a local assisted living and memory care facility.</p>



<p>During their appointment, Johnson noticed that Melissa hadn't had a mammogram for several years. When Melissa explained why she was reluctant to be screened, Johnson suggested she have a breast MRI.</p>



<p>"I'd still be getting screened, but with less pain," says Melissa. "So I said, 'Let's do it.'"</p>



<p>The MRI revealed an area of concern. Johnson recommended that Melissa have a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/preparing-for-your-breast-biopsy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biopsy</a>, but it would require a mammogram first. That's when Melissa met Amanda Steinberg, a radiology technologist in Owatonna. She was just the person Melissa needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overcoming mammogram fears, pain</h2>



<p>"Mammograms aren't a favorite activity for women," says Steinberg. "While it's a preventive screening, we have mammograms to make sure we don't have breast cancer. It's scary."</p>



<p>At 35, Steinberg had her own scare with a mammogram that showed an area of concern, so she understands her patients' fears and reluctance. She strives to set them at ease, explain simply and clearly what she's doing, take their mind off the compression and be as quick and effective as possible.</p>



<p>That understanding and empathy resonated with Melissa. So did Amanda's technique. Steinberg had learned that mammograms can be less painful if the patient doesn't reach forward to grip the handles on the machine.</p>



<p>"When you grip or make a fist, your pectoral muscles tense up. Squeezing a muscle that is already tight makes the pinching feeling of compression feel worse," she says.</p>



<p>That clenching also can create an undesirable "C" shape on the image. So instead, she tells patients not to raise their arms and grip but to let them hang relaxed by their sides.</p>



<p>"Women have told me how much better it is," says Steinberg.</p>



<p>Melissa agrees. "She was amazing, and I will never forget her, and I wish I'd found her sooner," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A closer look reveals a tumor</h2>



<p>The mammogram and a subsequent ultrasound were inconclusive, so Johnson ordered a biopsy that was performed on Dec. 6, 2023. Two days later, Melissa learned that the biopsy had confirmed an invasive ductile carcinoma tumor positioned right up against her chest wall.</p>



<p>"Suddenly, everything was insane," says Melissa.</p>



<p>The whirlwind of preoperative tests and appointments began, and she was informed of her options: a lumpectomy, radiation or a single or double mastectomy.</p>



<p>After talking through the options with her husband, Rick, she opted for a double mastectomy.</p>



<p>"I didn't want to undergo MRIs every six months or worry for the rest of my life," says Melissa.</p>



<p>Melissa met with Mayo Clinic Health System surgeons and had a double mastectomy on Jan. 30. After one night in the hospital, she was home and recovering with help from Rick and their children, Sarah and Joshua.</p>



<p>Before starting her on hormone-blocking cancer medication, Melissa's oncologist,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/mina-hanna-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mina Hanna, M.D.</a>, ordered a bone density scan. Melissa was delighted to learn that Amanda would conduct it since she had such a positive experience with the mammograms.</p>



<p>"After I've done mammograms for a patient, I usually don't know their results or even see them again," says Steinberg. "Doing Melissa's bone density scan felt like it was meant to be that we'd be on this journey together."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Genetics, recovery and a night at the ballpark</h2>



<p>At the start of her breast cancer journey, Melissa was surprised to learn her diagnosis because she didn't know of any women in her family who had breast cancer. Tests revealed the cancer was both estrogen and progesterone-positive but negative for BRCA 1 and 2 markers. Melissa wanted to learn more, so she underwent in-depth&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/medical-genetics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetics testing</a>, none of which indicated a genetic predisposition for breast cancer.</p>



<p>"I wanted to do extra testing so my daughter and son would have that information," says Melissa. She's now taking the hormone-blocking cancer medication and continuing her recovery.</p>



<p>"Everyone on my care team — Jessica, Amanda, Dr. Hanna, my surgeons and everyone else — has been so great," she says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="325" height="400" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/melissa-neuman-pitching.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389995" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/melissa-neuman-pitching.jpg 325w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/melissa-neuman-pitching-244x300.jpg 244w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo courtesy of Katie Friehl</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To celebrate her progress, Melissa threw out the first pitch at Cancer Survivors Night, sponsored by Mayo Clinic Health System, at a recent Mankato MoonDogs baseball game.</p>



<p>"This was my first outing since my surgery, and it was so fun and inspiring. I just hoped I'd throw a good pitch," says Melissa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Continuing to advance, refine mammograms</h2>



<p>Amanda is proud of her role in helping detect Melissa's breast cancer — and that of her other patients.</p>



<p>"I've always wanted to learn and do new things with mammography," she says.</p>



<p>She is particularly excited about new 3T MRI equipment in Owatonna, which will allow for MRI biopsies and more advanced imaging.</p>



<p>"This equipment will provide more support for breast procedures," she says. "And more patients will be able to stay close to home for first-rate care without traveling to Mayo Clinic in Rochester."</p>



<p>Melissa adds that her experience is a good example of why it's important for doctors and others working in healthcare to take women's health concerns seriously and provide them with options for preventive health scans and healthcare.</p>



<p>"If I didn't have a provider who listened and came up with a breast MRI to screen for breast cancer, we wouldn't have found it this early," she says.</p>

<p>You might think a dermatologist is going to ask you to ban the sun.</p>



<p>"There's nothing wrong with being outside in the sun," says Dr. Davis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UV, or ultraviolet light, is a carcinogen. That's where sunscreen helps.</p>



<p>"Sunscreen can act as a carcinogen barrier to help keep your skin safe," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>Keep these sunscreen facts in mind when you're reaching for your favorite bottle:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sunscreen can expire, affecting the active ingredient and the preservative.</li>



<li>Sunscreen is sensitive to extreme temperatures. Keep it out of direct sun, and don't let it freeze during winter storage.</li>



<li>People of color need to wear sunscreen.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bottom line, everyone over age 6 months needs sunscreen — babies included.</p>

<p>"It is a layman's myth that children do not get skin cancer. And it's a layman's myth that a person of color cannot have skin cancer," Dr. Davis says.</p>



<p>And lastly, Dr. Davis says, "There literally is no such thing as a waterproof sunscreen."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apply sunscreen, and after you get wet, reapply.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sunscreen application tips</h3>



<p>To be effective, sunscreen needs to be used liberally so be generous with your portions.</p>



<p>It's recommended to use&nbsp;1 ounce (30 milliliters) of sunscreen — the amount in a shot glass — to cover exposed parts of the body. You might need to apply more, depending on your body size. If you have a 4-ounce (118-milliliter) bottle, you'll use about a quarter of it during one application.</p>

<p>Today in the U.S., 7.2 % of adults identify as LGBTQ+ — that's more than 24 million people who often face stigma and discrimination that can make navigating the healthcare system difficult.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/cathcart-rake-elizabeth-j-m-d/bio-20558812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Cathcart-Rake, M.D.</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;medical oncologist specializing in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>, wants to change that. She's launched the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, to support the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, gender diverse and intersex (LGBTQ+) people with or at risk for breast cancer. She is also researching how to improve their cancer care experiences and outcomes.</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center Blog team spoke with Dr. Cathcart-Rake about the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic. Here's what she wants people to know about the clinic and the LGBTQ+ cancer care experience:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Meeting the unique needs of LGBTQ+ people</h2>



<p>People who identify as LGBTQ+ experience significant disparities in cancer care, including higher rates of late-stage diagnoses, poorer cancer outcomes, and side effects from therapy that go unaddressed.</p>



<p>"I am interviewing folks who talk about getting surgeries on their nose and having their surgical team not feel comfortable getting them dressed after surgery because of their gender identity and gender expression. These types of experiences, to me, are heartbreaking," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<p>Dr. Cathcart-Rake says LGBTQ+ people are less likely to be offered fertility preservation before cancer treatment and often have unaddressed sexual side effects from treatment. For transgender and gender-diverse people, she says there are questions and concerns about the interaction between hormone therapy, gender-affirming and cancer-specific surgeries.</p>



<p>Opening the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic is personal for Dr. Cathcart-Rake. "I have a dear friend who came out and experienced unbelievable discrimination and stigma. That experience has fueled this — thinking through what they've gone through every step of the way. Our role is to care for the person in front of us, no matter what."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Offering cancer care services in a supportive, affirming environment</h2>



<p>The Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic team provides specialty, multidisciplinary and person-affirming care for LGBTQ+ individuals in a safe and respectful environment while optimizing physical, emotional and social health.</p>



<p>"At every point on their cancer care journey, we want patients to see clinic staff who are excited and happy to see them and know the affirming, culturally appropriate language to use. To support that environment, we have posted LGBTQ–welcoming signage throughout the clinic, wear rainbow pins on our badges, and offer gender-neutral bathrooms," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<p>The team includes Dr. Cathcart-Rake and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/tevaarwerk-amye-j-m-d/bio-20527633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amye Tevaarwerk, M.D.</a>, another medical oncologist specializing in breast cancer. Jamie Carroll, a nurse practitioner; Gina Schultz, a registered nurse; and Nicole Sintler, a social worker, are also on the team. All team members are trained in providing care for LGBTQ+ people. The team also consults with a breast surgeon and a radiation oncologist with similar training.</p>



<p>"LGBTQ+ people experience so much discrimination and stigma — in everyday life and healthcare experiences. They deserve spaces like this where they're welcomed and supported and receive equitable healthcare," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake. "We hope this is just a starting point, and we can expand to other cancer types and subspecialties."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conducting research to improve cancer care for LGBTQ+ people</h2>



<p>Dr. Cathcart-Rake says research is needed to help healthcare professionals understand the cancer care disparities LGBTQ+ people experience. "We know there are inequities and aspects of their cancer care we're not addressing. But there's little data to better understand those needs and how we can improve outcomes," she says.</p>



<p>Research will be central to the Rainbow Breast Cancer Clinic's purpose. "That's going to be a huge part of this clinic — to better understand and identify LGBTQ+ peoples' needs and work collaboratively with patients and advocates to address them," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<p>Patients will be asked to complete surveys about their care experiences and symptoms to support this research. Information from these surveys will be used to continuously improve clinical care and to develop clinical trials focused on the needs of LGBTQ+ people related to breast cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to make an appointment</h2>



<p>Housed on the 10th Floor of the Gonda Building on Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minnesota, the Rainbows Breast Cancer Clinic is open to anyone who wishes to be seen in an LGBTQ–focused breast clinic.</p>



<p>To make an appointment, call the Medical Oncology Appointment Office in Rochester, Minnesota, at 507-284-8815 and mention "Rainbows."</p>



<p>Virtual visits will be allowed for any patient, as laws allow.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A generous $20 million gift from Dwight and Dian Diercks will fuel key elements of Mayo Clinic’s vision for the future of healthcare, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform</a> and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for early detection and intervention in cancer. In honor of their support, Mayo Clinic will establish the Dwight and Dian Diercks President, Mayo Clinic Platform, and create the Heidi Diercks Krause Fund in AI Innovation for Cancer, named in honor of Mr. Diercks’ late sister.</p>



<p>"The Dierckses’ visionary investment will bolster Mayo Clinic’s efforts through the Platform to curate the world's de-identified data, empower solution developers and transform healthcare around the world," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/our-team/john-d-halamka-md-ms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Halamka, M.D.</a>, the inaugural Dwight and Dian Diercks President, Mayo Clinic Platform.</p>



<p>“Through the reach of Mayo Clinic Platform, the Dierckses’ remarkable generosity will accelerate new innovations that fundamentally change how health systems and care teams provide care to improve patients' lives,” says Dr. Halamka, who also holds the Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President’s Strategic Initiative Professorship.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Platform is a key focus of Mayo Clinic’s Bold. Forward. strategy to transform healthcare globally. Disrupting the traditional pipeline paradigm, Mayo Clinic Platform brings together solution developers, data partners and healthcare organizations to collaborate around secure, de-identified clinical data to create, validate and scale digital health solutions. It currently offers access to a diverse dataset of 46 million de-identified and longitudinal patient records, AI model validation for accuracy and removal of bias, and streamlined clinical integration. This transformative model is expediting a new era of revolutionary diagnostics and treatments that redefine the frontiers of patient care and well-being.</p>



<p>The Heidi Diercks Krause Fund in AI Innovation for Cancer will enable Mayo Clinic’s Generative Artificial Intelligence Program and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> to advance answers for cancer. An example of this work includes developing advanced generative AI tools to gain deep insights into a person’s risk of developing cancer. This forecasting will allow clinicians to intervene earlier than ever before — even before cancer can be diagnosed.</p>



<p>“We are profoundly grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Diercks for their support, which will help us bring the promise of AI to patients at the earliest phases of their care journeys,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/callstrom-matthew-r-m-d-ph-d/bio-00085927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Callstrom, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic’s medical director for Strategy, chair of Radiology in Rochester and leader of the Generative Artificial Intelligence Program. “Cancer affects people from all walks of life, and leveraging AI to tackle and treat this devastating disease will be critical for improving outcomes for all patients.”</p>



<p>As senior vice president of software engineering at NVIDIA, Mr. Diercks has been involved in AI innovation since the company’s inception.</p>



<p>“We can't afford to wait years or decades for new AI breakthroughs in healthcare. People need new therapies and cures now,” says Mr. Diercks. “Dian and I truly believe that Mayo Clinic Platform and AI innovation will be the keys to better predicting diseases like cancer, so physicians can intervene sooner with more effective treatments that save, extend or improve the quality of patient lives. It gives me comfort knowing my sister’s legacy will live on through these efforts to transform cancer care for everyone. Heidi lived for her family, and having additional time with her husband, Scott, and daughter, Kate, meant the world to her.&nbsp;In the future, we hope that extension of time can be amplified tenfold for others.”</p>



<p>Mr. Diercks grew up in Red Wing, Minnesota, less than 50 miles from Mayo Clinic’s Rochester campus, where he worked on his family’s farm as a teenager. His close family, including his late father and sister, trusted Mayo Clinic for their most complex health needs.</p>



<p>“I tell my friends that receiving care at Mayo Clinic is like being at the intersection of medicine and hardcore engineering. Everyone is focused on finding the right tests and data to solve the most personal, important health challenges in your life,” says Mr. Diercks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. Diercks earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering with a minor in business from the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). The Dierckses have provided transformational support to MSOE that has resulted in a nation-leading computer science program in applied AI and supercomputing. With their latest gift to Mayo Clinic, they aim to provide the same accelerant to AI innovation, now within healthcare.</p>

<p>Black people are more likely to die from prostate, lung and breast cancer than other races. Dr. Barbel Johnson says there are many contributing factors, including genetics, habits and other mitigating circumstances.</p>



<p>"It has a lot to do with the structural racism that has created the environment, not only for access but for prioritizing and evolving treatments," says Dr. Barbel Johnson.</p>



<p>The family medicine physician says regular cancer screenings are key to increasing survival rates.</p>



<p>"It's important that we prioritize those things where we're seeing the incidence and the death rates are highest in these populations to be screened for those conditions," says Dr. Barbel Johnson.</p>



<p>Knowing your family history, regular exercise and eating a healthy diet are also crucial to cutting cancer risks.</p>



<p>"In doing so, we will then decrease things like red meat, increase things like vegetables within our diet, decrease the amounts of sugar and artificial sweeteners that we have in our diet," she says.</p>



<p>She also recommends stopping tobacco use and getting adequate sleep.</p>

<p>It's that time of year when everyone's looking forward to some fun in the sun. Too much sun can be dangerous, though. Exposure to UV radiation from the sun damages your skin, and children are especially vulnerable because they tend to spend more time outdoors and can burn easily.</p>



<p>Skin damage from the sun increases your risk of developing:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Skin cancer</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20377605?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skin cancer</a> develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms, hands and legs.&nbsp;Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions. Skin cancer occurs when mutations occur in the DNA of skin cells. Much of the damage to DNA in skin cells results from UV radiation found in sunlight and in the lights used in tanning beds.</li>



<li><strong>Wrinkles</strong><br>Although genetics mainly determine skin structure and texture, sun exposure is a major cause of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wrinkles/symptoms-causes/syc-20354927?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrinkles</a>, especially for people with light skin. Exposure to&nbsp;UV&nbsp;light breaks down your skin's connective tissue — collagen and elastin fibers, which lie in the deeper layer of skin. Without the supportive connective tissue, your skin loses strength and flexibility. Skin then begins to sag and wrinkle prematurely.</li>



<li><strong>Age spots</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/age-spots/symptoms-causes/syc-20355859?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age spots</a> are caused by overactive pigment cells. UV light speeds up the production of melanin, a natural pigment that gives skin its color. On skin that has had years of sun exposure, age spots appear when melanin becomes clumped or is produced in high concentrations. Use of commercial tanning lamps and beds also can cause age spots.</li>
</ul>



<p>One way to protect your skin is to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor, or SPF, of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring. Use a generous amount of sunscreen on all exposed skin, including your lips, the tips of your ears, and the backs of your hands and neck.</p>



<p>Sunscreens are required by the Food and Drug Administration to remain at their original strength for at least three years. This means that you can use leftover sunscreen from one year to the next. Some sunscreens include an expiration date — a date indicating when they're no longer effective. Discard sunscreen that is past its expiration date. If you buy sunscreen that doesn't have an expiration date, write the date of purchase on the bottle. Throw out the bottle when three years have passed since the purchase date.</p>



<p>In addition to sunscreen, avoid sun exposure in the middle of the day when the UV rays are strongest, wear sunglasses that block both types of UV radiation — UVA and UVB rays — and wear a broad-brimmed hat and other protective clothing.</p>



<p>Exercising and enjoying time outdoors are important for good health. Staying protected from the sun will allow you and your family to do so safely.</p>

<p>Ultraviolet rays from the sun can cause skin damage in as little as 15 minutes. Prolonged exposure and damage can lead to various forms of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/basics/definition/con-20031606" target="_blank">skin cancer</a>, many of which, thankfully, are preventable.</p>



<p>The sun isn't the only skin-damaging predator. Tanning beds and smoking also can have ill effects on the body's outer layer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the common forms of skin cancer?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Skin cancer can take many forms, but the three most common are:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/basics/definition/con-20028996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Basal cell carcinoma</a></strong><br>Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It typically develops on skin that receives a lot of sun, such as the scalp, face, nose, neck and hands. It often appears as a dome-shaped growth with visible blood vessels, a shiny, pinkish patch or a sore that heals and then returns.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/basics/definition/con-20037813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squamous cell carcinoma</a></strong><br>Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer. It also frequently develops on skin exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, lips, back of the hands, arms and legs. Squamous cell carcinoma often appears as a crusted or rough bump; a red, rough flat patch; a dome-shaped bump that grows and bleeds; or a sore that does not heal or heals and returns.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/basics/definition/con-20026009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Melanoma</a></strong><br>Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. It may develop on the skin or in an existing mole. Moles that change in size, color or shape, or develop symptoms, such as pain, itching or bleeding, can be a sign of melanoma. Melanoma can occur anywhere on the skin, including the hands and feet, under the fingernails or toenails, and in the mouth and genital area.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing skin cancer</h2>



<p>The keys to preventing skin cancer are to be sun savvy and know how to keep your skin healthy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Be smart in the sun and protect your skin with these tips:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</strong><br>This is when the sun is most intense and produces the greatest chance of sunburn. If you must be outside during these hours, seek shade using an umbrella, tree or other shelter. Use protective clothing and sunscreen even when in the shade. Learn more with this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/multimedia/skin-cancer-infographic/ifg-20441507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"More Fun, Less Sun" infographic</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Be aware of medications that increase your sensitivity to the sun.</strong><br>Some prescription and over-the-counter medications can make you more sensitive to sunlight. Common drugs include antihistamines such as Benadryl; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including naproxen or ibuprofen; certain antibiotics, including Bactrim or tetracycline; antidepressants; antipsychotics and oral diabetes medications. Check with your pharmacist regarding the side effects of your medication.</li>



<li><strong>Don the right head gear.</strong><br>A wide-brimmed hat can protect your face, ears and neck. If you wear a baseball cap, remember to apply sunscreen to your neck and ears. Also, wear protective clothing that covers exposed areas.</li>



<li><strong>Don't use tanning beds.</strong><br>Tanning beds produce harmful ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, increasing your risk for skin cancer. There also is no proven evidence that using tanning beds to obtain a "base tan" will decrease your risk of sunburn. Beyond that, using tanning beds increases the chance of developing cataracts and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eye-melanoma/basics/definition/con-20027875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ocular melanoma</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Make healthy lifestyle choices.</strong><br>Your behaviors and habits affect the health of your skin. Do not smoke because it damages collagen and elastin in your skin. When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/look-good-and-feel-better-with-skin-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caring for your skin</a>, use mild soaps and daily moisturizers while limiting hot showers which can strip essential oils from your skin. Drink plenty of water to remain hydrated, and get regular sleep to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/what-to-do-about-dry-skin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep your skin looking refreshed</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Perform regular skin checks.</strong><br>Look for any changes to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-abcdes-of-moles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moles</a>, freckles or birthmarks. Additionally, monitor any new skin changes that have occurred. Use a mirror to evaluate hard-to-see areas, and have regular skin evaluations by your healthcare team or dermatologist.</li>



<li><strong>Protect children's skin.</strong><br>Children younger than 6 months should not use sunscreen but should be protected from the sun's rays with protective clothing and shade. Apply sunscreen regularly to children 6 months and older.</li>



<li><strong>Use sunscreen when outdoors.</strong><br>A higher sun protection factor, or SPF, number in sunscreen indicates increased protection. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using at least SPF 30. Use sunscreen even on cloudy or cool days because damage from the sun's rays can still occur. Reapply every two hours. You also should reapply after swimming or when sweating. Check the sunscreen's expiration date. The shelf life typically is three years or less if it has been stored in high temperatures.</li>



<li><strong>Wear sunglasses with UVA and UVB protection.</strong><br>Proper, protective sunglasses help prevent damage to the sensitive skin around your eyes and block ultraviolet light from the sun that may cause&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cataracts/basics/definition/con-20015113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cataracts</a>.</li>

<p>About 1 in 8 men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Many of those patients undergo surgery to get rid of the cancerous tumor.</p>

<p>"Most of the time, prostate cancer is a slower-growing type of tumor," says Dr. Tollefson. "Physically removing it could then cure one from cancer."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Advancements in robotic prostate surgery</h3>



<p>He says surgery is a common option for many men, especially if the cancer is contained in the prostate. Medical innovation has improved cancer removal surgeries. Now, there's an upgrade to the robotic prostatectomy procedure.</p>



<p>"Instead of all of the instruments coming in through separate incisions, they come in through a single incision, and the robot is able to then branch out within the abdomen and remove the prostate," explains Dr. Tollefson.</p>



<p>Patients have a faster recovery and reduced pain with the single-port robotic procedure.</p>



<p>Other prostate cancer treatment options can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Radiation therapy.</li>



<li>Ablative therapies.</li>



<li>Hormone therapy.</li>



<li>Chemotherapy.</li>



<li>Immunotherapy.</li>



<li>Targeted drug therapy.</li>

<p>Ask anyone experiencing cancer fatigue, and they will tell you that it's horrendous. It can feel like your body is working overtime, and you're super exhausted. It's the type of tiredness that won't go away if you rest a bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's different from the normal tiredness we typically have, as it's more intense. It's not easily relieved with rest, and it can greatly impact how you're feeling and doing," says Dr. Barksdale.</p>

<p>He says there are several factors that contribute to cancer-related fatigue, including chemotherapy, radiation, anemia, emotional factors and the cancer itself.</p>



<p>"And then preexisting comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, fatigue and sleep apnea, can also play a role in cancer-related fatigue as well," explains Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<p>Treatments vary from person to person, but they can consist of physical therapy, energy conservation, psychostimulants and holistic methods.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Staying active helps fight cancer tiredness</h3>



<p>"Yoga, tai chi, Reiki therapy, integrative medicine techniques," says Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<p>It's a good idea to prioritize your schedule and only do the important things. Also, ask for help when needed. Contact your healthcare team if you're suffering from cancer-related fatigue. Mayo Clinic also has a cancer<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cancer-rehabilitation/about/pac-20393327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rehabilitation</a> program to help survivors get back on their feet.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips to manage cancer fatigue:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Stick with a routine.</li>



<li>Increase physical activity.</li>



<li>Make a good night's sleep a priority.</li>



<li>Set daily goals.</li>



<li>Take rest breaks.</li>

<p>Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer. When treated early, it's also the most curable type of cancer.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/mohs-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mohs surgery</a>&nbsp;is one of the most successful surgical treatments for removing skin cancer.</p>



<p>The abnormal growth of skin cells that leads to skin cancer develops most often on skin exposed to the sun, such as your scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, arms and hands. However, it can also occur on areas of your skin not directly exposed to sunlight, including your palms and beneath your fingernails or toenails.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types of skin cancer</h2>



<p>Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma are three of the most common types of skin cancer. Of those three types, basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are diagnosed most often and are the most curable.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Basal cell carcinoma&nbsp;</strong>— This type of skin cancer often starts as a small, flesh-colored or pearly-looking bump on the skin. It may bleed or have no symptoms. It may look like a pimple that doesn't entirely heal.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/basics/definition/con-20028996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Basal cell carcinoma</a>&nbsp;may extend deep into the tissue under the skin.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma</strong>&nbsp;— This type of skin cancer often starts as a rough or scaly patch or growth on the skin. It can develop rapidly and hurt a bit if touched.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/basics/definition/con-20037813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squamous cell carcinoma</a>&nbsp;usually appears in one place on the skin and rarely spreads to other parts of the body. However, if left untreated, this cancer may grow within the skin and destroy surrounding tissues and structures, such as nerves and muscles. The cancerous cells can then spread to nearby lymph nodes and other areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Melanoma&nbsp;</strong>— While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/basics/definition/con-20026009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melanoma</a>&nbsp;occurs less commonly, it's more serious. It often begins as a dark spot or odd-looking mole. It can grow deep into the tissue under the skin. If left untreated, melanoma can spread to other parts of the body. Early detection and treatment of this cancer are critical.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treating skin cancer with Mohs surgery</h2>



<p>Mohs surgery is intended to remove all the cancerous tissue, called a tumor, and leave as much healthy neighboring skin and tissue as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To diagnose skin cancer, a healthcare professional removes a biopsy, or small tissue sample, to be examined. While you can see the top of the tumor growing on the skin's surface, deeper roots may be out of sight under the skin. The method used during Mohs surgery looks closely at the affected area and surrounding skin to find and remove all of the tumor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Mohs surgeon may recommend this procedure for skin cancer that:</p>



<ul>
<li>Has come back after previous treatment or has a high risk of recurring.</li>



<li>Has developed rapidly and deeply.</li>



<li>Is located around the face, scalp or neck.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect with Mohs surgery</h2>



<p>Mohs surgery is an outpatient surgery, meaning you won't stay in the hospital overnight. The length of the surgery depends on the size and number of tumors to be removed. While surgery can last between one to 10 hours, most surgeries take two to five hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During Mohs surgery, the area of your skin is numbed first. Then, the surgeon removes the tumor and a thin layer of skin around it. After any bleeding is stopped, a temporary bandage is applied. These steps typically take about 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While you wait in the surgical waiting room, the surgeon maps each section of tissue from the tumor that was removed and uses a microscope to examine it for cancer cells. If the surgeon finds cancer cells, the map helps to locate the position in the skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You'll return to the surgical room for the surgeon to remove more tissue from the area where the cancer cells are found. These steps are repeated until the surgeon no longer sees cancer cells under the microscope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the tumor is completely removed, the surgeon determines the best option for closing the wound area, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Side-to-side stitches — Most surgeries are closed this way with a row of sutures if enough loose skin is available next to the wound.</li>



<li>Skin graft — The surgeon may remove a piece of skin from another part of your body to place over the wound.&nbsp;</li>



<li>No stitches — The wound may be left open to heal on its own, depending on the area of the body.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Cartilage harvest — Cartilage is a connective tissue found in the nose and ear. Your surgeon may take cartilage from one of these areas to repair and support the wound.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Skin flap — If your wound is too large to close with side-to-side stitches, a skin flap is used to move nearby skin to cover it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>After surgery, your surgeon may prescribe an antibiotic to lower the risk of infection in the wound. Follow instructions from your care team for managing pain. Depending on the location and size of the wound, each person may have a different level and time frame for pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Healing time also depends on the size of the wound and the way it was closed. The procedure can cause scarring, which will typically soften naturally over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After having skin cancer once, you are at a higher risk of having a recurrence of the same type of cancer or another type of skin cancer. Talk with your healthcare team about how frequently you need full-body skin examinations.</p>
