<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric surgery</a> is more than just surgery. It's a lifestyle change that includes a lifelong <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/establishing-healthy-behaviors-that-stick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to eating healthy</a> with your dietitian's guidance and incorporating <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-5-elements-of-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regular exercise</a> into your routine.</p>



<p>After bariatric surgery, patients who regularly exercise for 60 minutes six days a week lose weight more quickly and dramatically improve their capacity for exercise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take advantage of peak weight-loss period</h2>



<p>The time to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/doctors-orders/need-to-exercise-start-slowly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">establish your exercise habits</a> is before you have the surgery. Then solidify that routine during the first year after surgery, which is when people typically find it easiest to lose weight.</p>



<p>After bariatric surgery, your body may try to hold onto its fat stores until its other energy sources are depleted. This can lead to the loss of muscle mass after surgery. To minimize or prevent the body from using muscle mass for energy, it's crucial to work your muscles regularly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some of the benefits of cardio, strength and endurance training are:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Improved heart condition, balance, stability and mood</li>



<li>Increased energy, lean muscle mass and bone density</li>



<li>Reduced body fat, risk of injury and stress</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Amp up, change your exercise routine</h2>



<p>When people lose weight, their energy expenditure — the number of calories the body burns — is reduced both at rest and during exercise. This means that when you lose weight, but continue the same exercise routine, you burn fewer calories than before you lost weight.</p>



<p>In addition, regular exercise increases your capacity and ability to work harder. As you become better conditioned, your workout will feel easier than when you first began. This is an indication that it's time to increase the exercise intensity.</p>



<p>You want to aim for a level of cardiorespiratory exercise that's somewhat difficult for you. One test of intensity is if you can talk in breathy sentences as you exercise. If you can't speak, scale back until you can.</p>



<p>Consider changing your exercise routine by <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/prevent-boredom-and-injury-during-physical-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying something new</a>. If you feel comfortable with your treadmill workout, try switching to another piece of equipment, such as an elliptical or cycle. Or take a class such as low-impact aerobics, spinning, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/aquatic-exercise-healthy-easy-on-the-body" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water fitness</a> or aerobic dance.</p>



<p>These tweaks to your routine can challenge your body in new ways and help maintain your interest in exercising. Workout variety also plays a significant role five to six months after bariatric surgery, when many patients experience a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/why-has-my-weight-plateaued-when-i-have-50-more-pounds-to-lose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss plateau</a>. Changing your exercise routine can minimize or even eliminate a plateau.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Increase exercise intensity, time, frequency</h2>



<p>As your fitness improves, you'll be able to increase the intensity, time or frequency of your exercise routine. One way to do that is through <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/interval-training-for-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-intensity interval training (HIIT)</a>. As with any new form of exercise, check with your healthcare team to make sure HIIT is a good fit for you.</p>



<p>A HIIT workout alternates between short intense bursts of exercise and active recovery, which is like a "breather" with less intense exercise. Research shows that HIIT workouts are more effective for heart health, fat loss and strength gain than traditional cardio and strength training. HIIT can be incorporated into nearly any exercise from running to water fitness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pay attention to strength training</h2>



<p>As you plan your routine, focus on <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/no-matter-your-age-or-skill-level-its-never-too-late-to-start-weight-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">muscle-strengthening exercises</a> at least three days a week, which will also improve your bone density and metabolism. Muscle burns calories even at rest, so if you increase your muscle mass, you will burn more calories throughout the day.</p>



<p>You can build muscle strength using weight machines, resistance bands, free weights and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/isometric-exercise-and-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your own body weight</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new lifestyle, not a chore</h2>



<p>You've undergone bariatric surgery not only to lose weight but also to improve your health. Reaching your goals requires changing your lifestyle, and exercise is essential to that success. Becoming a regular exerciser can be empowering, fun and open doors to meeting new people and broadening your interests.</p>



<p>To keep exercise from becoming a chore, find what you like to do, but switch it up to add variety and challenge your body in different ways. Cardio and strength training are both key to a successful exercise and weight-loss routine.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A healthy gut helps lower your risk of developing inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chedid-victor-g-m-d-m-s/bio-20478657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Victor Chedid, M.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist and IBD expert at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, offers tips people can take to keep their gut healthy and inflammatory diseases at bay.</p>



<p>Dr. Chedid recommends a four-pronged approach to gut health:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Nutrition: Try to eat a well-balanced <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mediterranean-style</a> diet that includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds, and olive oil. Dr. Chedid recommends eating 30 to 40 grams of fiber daily. Dr. Chedid says this type of diet has a lot of antioxidants and fewer foods that cause inflammation.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Exercise/healthy lifestyle: Aim to incorporate regular exercise into your routine. The type of exercise can vary by person.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Mental health: It's important to maintain your mental health and well-being, given the many interactions between the gut and the brain. For example, people who have been through childhood trauma or who have many other stressors in their lives may experience gastrointestinal symptoms or conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, pelvic floor dysfunction or constipation.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Water intake: Aim to drink 64 ounces of water daily. This helps prevent constipation and ensures your organs are well nourished. It is particularly important in hot climates, where dehydration can be an issue.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Paying attention to all these factors is essential for maintaining gut health," Dr. Chedid says.</p>



<p>Maintaining gut health is important, especially when a person is dealing with inflammatory bowel disease. There are two main types of IBD:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353309?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353331?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a>.</p>



<p>IBD is a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgh.14872#:~:text=Traditionally%2C%20IBD%20has%20been%20regarded%20as%20a%20disease,which%20have%20more%20than%20one%20billion%20inhabitants%202." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global</a> disease with about 6-8 million cases <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(19)30333-4/fulltext#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20there%20were%206%C2%B78%20million,%2895%25%20UI%206%C2%B74%E2%80%937%C2%B73%29%20cases%20of%20IBD%20globally." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worldwide</a>. The prevalence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7684461/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rise</a> in African countries, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region.</p>



<p>"That's why we have to increase awareness and make sure that people seek care when they have symptoms so that they can get the diagnosis and care that is appropriate for them," Dr. Chedid says.</p>



<p>There is no cure for IBD, but a variety of treatments exist to help patients achieve remission. These include anti-inflammatory drugs, immune system suppressors, biologics, antibiotics and surgery.</p>



<p>Diarrhea and rectal bleeding are common symptoms, but these symptoms can make people with IBD feel ashamed and hesitant to seek support. Dr. Chedid says families can play a crucial role in helping their loved ones manage IBD.</p>



<p>"It's about being there for them, recognizing that they're not always going to be themselves at all times," Dr. Chedid says. "There will be times when they feel down, are in pain or don't want to eat what you cook. Don't be offended. You just need to be there for them."</p>

<p>A trip to Disney World in 2023 was an eye-opener for Katie Crow. It wasn't the rides, parades or immersive activities that caught her attention but that she struggled to have the energy to go to the amusement park every day.</p>



<p>"It wasn't the experience I wanted it to be. That's when I knew I finally needed to do something about my weight," says Katie, an endoscopy nurse with Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Crosse</a>, Wisconsin.</p>



<p>That summer, the 36-year-old saw her weight reach 296 pounds. Katie suffered from leg and back pain, had been diagnosed with severe <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/do-i-have-sleep-apnea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep apnea</a>, and her energy was at an all-time low. She also worried about developing diabetes and heart disease, which run in her family. Since 2019, she also had been coping with anxiety and depression.</p>



<p>"The worst part was I couldn't keep up with my kids," says Katie, the mother of three children, now ages 15, 13 and 3. "I was just surviving."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exploring the options</h2>



<p>No stranger to battling her weight, Katie had tried a slew of diets, but none were successful. In the spring of 2023, her primary care provider referred her to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/bariatric-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric Surgery Department</a> at Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse. There she learned about her options, which included <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-skinny-on-weight-loss-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss drugs</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a>.</p>



<p>"I considered the weight-loss drugs, but at the time, some hadn't been approved yet, and given the side effects, they didn't seem like an option for me," says Katie. "But the statistics showing the success of bariatric surgery sounded promising."</p>



<p>Katie hadn't decided on her next steps, and then came the Disney World trip. The trip turned out to be the push she needed to finalize her decision to proceed with surgery, even though she was nervous about the permanent nature of the procedure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing weight-loss surgery</h2>



<p>With the decision made, Katie started her bariatric surgery journey, which included various consultations, a psychological examination and a two-week pre-op diet to prepare her body for the surgery. She also met with <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/kathriena-greenwell-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathriena Greenwell, M.D.</a>, who would perform the surgery.</p>



<p>"Dr. Greenwell took the time to answer all my questions and thoroughly explain the risks and benefits," says Katie.</p>



<p>"Katie was an excellent candidate for surgery. Since the surgery, she's been very motivated in her weight-loss goals, dedicated to the weight-management program and is taking her lifestyle changes seriously," says Dr. Greenwell.</p>



<p>In December 2023, Katie underwent surgery. While her body healed, she was on a restricted diet for six weeks.</p>



<p>"I thought I'd never eat real food again," says Katie. "But I'd made the commitment and was determined to make it work."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making lifestyle changes</h2>



<p>When she made her choice, Katie knew that this was a lifelong commitment. She decided to track her experience on social media, posting about the ups and downs of her weight loss and the changes she was making. The most noticeable was the pounds she was shedding. In five months, Katie lost 109 pounds and 84 inches off her body. She'd dropped from size 3X to large.</p>



<p>There were other changes, as well. Dr. Greenwell says Katie's&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank">body mass index, or BMI</a>, has decreased from 49.26 to 31, and she no longer is considered morbidly obese. Dr. Greenwell also noted that Katie has stopped experiencing gastric reflux and anticipates that as she loses more weight, she won't require a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine to treat her sleep apnea.</p>



<p>"Hopefully, by losing weight now while she's young, it will prevent her from developing the complications of obesity, including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension," says Dr. Greenwell.</p>



<p>Katie also has seen other personal victories beyond the numbers on the scale. Her leg and back pain are gone, she doesn't worry if a chair will hold her when she sits down, and she delights in shopping for clothes wherever she wants. Her anxiety and depression also have subsided.</p>



<p>"I have more energy than before," says Katie. "My goal is to get down to 150 pounds, but based on the way I feel now, I'd be happy staying at this weight. Bariatric surgery is a tool, but you still have to do the work every day. It requires mental toughness and dedication; I didn't realize how challenging it would be mentally."</p>



<p>For those considering weight-loss surgery, Katie advises researching the process and understanding the commitment you'll be making.</p>



<p>"Going in, you know that you're going to be on vitamins and supplements forever, you won't be able to tolerate certain foods, you need to monitor your protein and hydration, and you have to become a regular exerciser," says Katie. "But ultimately, you have to look at the bigger picture.</p>



<p>"I'm no longer just surviving; I'm thriving. I've become the mom I always dreamt of being," she says. "My only regret is that I didn't do this sooner."</p>

<p>Dealing with chronic conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis can be challenging and sometimes embarrassing. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-inflammatory-bowel-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</a> can cause diarrhea, stomach pain, weight loss and other symptoms. Also, the intersectionality of LGBTQ+ identity and having a chronic illness like IBD can sometimes make it difficult for patients to discuss their symptoms with healthcare professionals.</p>



<p>In July 2022, Mayo Clinic was one of the first in the nation to open an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/vid-20555152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBD Pride Clinic</a>. The clinic aims to create an affirming space for LGBTQ+ patients to talk about their specific healthcare concerns.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/ani-2-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389743" style="width:717px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/ani-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/ani-2-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/ani-2-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/ani-2-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> IBD patient Ani Roy in the early years of his diagnosis</figcaption></figure>



<p>Twenty-seven-year-old Ani Roy, a patient, Mayo Clinic staff member and transmasculine nonbinary person, says the IBD Pride Clinic is a place of comfort.</p>



<p>Ani doesn't take eating for granted. They were diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2017 after experiencing painful stomach aches and, at times, being unable to eat.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It was difficult to digest foods</strong></h3>



<p>"The only thing that I was really able to eat was chicken strips and raspberry iced tea. For some reason, those were the only things that didn't make me want to vomit," explains Ani.</p>



<p>Inflammatory bowel disease took a toll on Ani's body, causing frequent trips to the toilet with bloody diarrhea and other symptoms.</p>



<p>"It got to the point where I was starting to pass out," they say. "I was shaking and just, like, sweating, feeling very faint and wasn't really able to function as a human being."</p>



<p>After several hospitalizations and failed medications, Ani had their colon and rectum removed, leaving them with an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/ostomy/art-20045825">ileostomy</a>. The surgical procedure creates an opening in the stomach to divert stool. Waste is collected in an ostomy bag that's attached to the abdomen," says Ani.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crohn's disease is mentally and physically challenging</strong></h3>



<p>"It is a very big mental adjustment," they say.</p>



<p>With the stigma surrounding the ileostomy and their gender identity and sexual orientation, Ani reached out to the Mayo Clinic IBD Pride Clinic for support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389699" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Patient Ani Roy talks with Dr. Victor Chedid.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"Many LGBTQ+ patients suffer in silence," says Dr. Victor Chedid, director of the Mayo Clinic IBD Pride Clinic. </p>



<p>"They might be struggling with their identity internally. And add to it the fact that you're struggling with your diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, that has a double or additional psychological impact on you," says Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>"It's so nice to go to a provider that is informed about the LGBTQ+ community so that I don't feel like I have to educate them on that part of me. I can just be that part of me," says Ani.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healing and Hope</strong></h3>



<p>The IBD Pride Clinic is staffed by healthcare professionals who are trained to be sensitive in the care of LGBTQ+ patients.</p>



<p>"This is a safe space for you to talk to us about your inflammatory bowel disease and anything that might be impacting your life," says Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ani is turning their pain into purpose, sewing ostomy bag covers for themselves and others. Living life one day — and one stitch — at a time.</p>



<p>"Overall, I'm doing pretty well, living life as best as I can," says Ani.</p>

<p><strong>Rich Bugay had an appointment with the </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology</strong></a><strong> at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on a Monday, where he had hoped to get answers and relief for what he thought was refractory <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-healthcare-expert-explains-why-reflux-disease-isnt-just-heartburn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acid reflux </a>— until his doctor discovered a heart murmur. The next morning, Rich was told he had congenital heart disease and a severely dilated aorta that could rupture. Just two days later, Rich underwent lifesaving heart surgery. After a whirlwind four days, Rich was on the road to recovery.<br>___________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>



<p>Rich Bugay, an HVAC business owner, husband, and father to two children, hadn't been feeling well for over a year. What started out as sinus issues gradually turned into severe acid reflux and exhaustion, making it hard for Rich to get through the workday.</p>



<p>"I wasn't feeling well — I had a lot of acid reflux and stomach discomfort. I had been going to a lot of different doctor visits, like my family practitioner, and I wasn't getting any answers," says Rich. "And so, at some point, I decided I wanted to go to the best place I could go."</p>

<p>Rich and his wife, Lori, left their house in Escanaba, Michigan, and drove more than six hours to Mayo Clinic in Rochester for an appointment with Dr. Houssam Halawi, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist.</p>



<p>During the appointment, Dr. Halawi listened to Rich's history, concerns and symptoms.</p>



<p>"And what caught my attention was, he had a lot of different symptoms that didn't really belong in the GI (gastrointestinal) world," says Dr. Halawi. "And at that point, in my mind, I was thinking this is not an acid reflux problem."</p>

<p>When Dr. Halawi listened to Rich's heart, he heard a suspicious murmur. He knew something — potentially big — was going on, and he recommended that Rich receive an urgent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856#:~:text=An%20echocardiogram%20uses%20sound%20waves%20to%20create%20pictures%20of%20the,disease%20and%20other%20heart%20conditions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>. An echocardiogram is a common test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart to find heart disease and other heart conditions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich was hesitant to have the echocardiogram since he just wanted some relief from his presumed acid reflux and didn't think he had a life-threatening issue.</p>



<p>Knowing that Rich would most likely go home if the echocardiogram couldn't be scheduled quickly, Dr. Halawi asked the scheduling team if there was any way they could arrange the echocardiogram for the next day. When the scheduler asked, "Would tomorrow morning work for you?" Dr. Halawi didn't expect it to be that quick.</p>



<p>Rich and Lori decided to stay at Mayo Clinic for the echocardiogram the next morning.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Confirming suspicions</h2>



<p>Kylie Marvin, the sonographer who performed the echocardiogram, immediately noticed something was seriously wrong. She walked out into the hallway and informed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jain-c-charles-m-d/bio-20543120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Charles Jain</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, about her findings.</p>



<p>"His aorta was severely dilated, well over what we would traditionally consider as the surgical cutoff for elective intervention," says Dr. Jain.</p>



<p>A severely enlarged aorta — the pipe that delivers blood out of the heart — could have acute complications, such as a rupture, which can be life-threatening.</p>



<p>The echocardiogram also showed that Rich had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bicuspid-aortic-valve/cdc-20385577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bicuspid aortic valve</a>.</p>



<p>The aortic valve usually has three cusps. A bicuspid valve has only two cusps. Rich's bicuspid valve wasn't closing tightly, which was causing blood to flow backward.</p>



<p>Dr. Jain called a radiologist and arranged an urgent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> for Rich that same day. The results of the CT scan confirmed the findings, and Dr. Jain called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bagameri-gabor-m-d/bio-20384030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gabor Bagameri,</a> a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular surgeon, who was willing to make room in his schedule to quickly see Rich and arrange for surgery.</p>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic, the needs of the patient always come first, and even in the middle of the night, 24/7, you can always reach for help," says Dr. Bagameri.</p>



<p>He encouraged Rich that his heart problems were fixable and advised him not to wait to undergo surgery.</p>



<p>"He let me think about it and came back into the room about five minutes later and he says, 'OK, so we're going to do this Thursday, right?' I say, 'You know it.' And he says, 'I knew you were going to say that!' So, we were ready," says Rich.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"Like a well-oiled machine<strong>"</strong></h2>



<p>On the day of the surgery, Rich said everything was very structured and organized. The surgery itself was a success, as was his hospital stay.</p>



<p>"Like a well-oiled machine, everything just went so well, so smoothly," says Lori. "I've never experienced anything like that before, and that's how healthcare should be everywhere. Everyone deserves to be treated like they do here."</p>



<p>Now, nearly six months after his procedure, Rich feels almost 100% better.</p>



<p>"They saved my life," says Rich. "I'm a completely different person — I feel like a million bucks. I can do what I want to do, and my energy levels are much better."</p>



<p>Looking back on the experience, Dr. Halawi recognizes that Rich wouldn't have had such a positive outcome without every single person involved at Mayo Clinic. Dr. Jain echoes that sentiment, "When there are patients who are having a significant abnormality, particularly with urgency, such as Rich's, everything is already set up for teamwork to be natural, and fortunately, this makes it all relatively seamless."</p>



<p>Reflecting on his healthcare journey, Rich says that you need to advocate for yourself.</p>



<p>"If you haven’t been feeling right for a long time and feel like you're not getting answers, come to Mayo Clinic because they'll get to the bottom of it," says Rich.</p>

<p>People often associate IBD with the bathroom because of its symptoms, but it's a serious and chronic condition. There are two main types of IBD: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353309?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353331?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a>.</p>



<p>"Ulcerative colitis only impacts the colon and causes inflammation in the entire colon, while Crohn's disease can impact anywhere from the mouth to the anus," says Dr. Chedid.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/a-young-child-perhaps-a-girl-holding-her-stomach-because-it-aches-and-hurts-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="a young child, perhaps a girl, holding her stomach because it aches and hurts" class="wp-image-324332" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/a-young-child-perhaps-a-girl-holding-her-stomach-because-it-aches-and-hurts-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/a-young-child-perhaps-a-girl-holding-her-stomach-because-it-aches-and-hurts-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/a-young-child-perhaps-a-girl-holding-her-stomach-because-it-aches-and-hurts-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/a-young-child-perhaps-a-girl-holding-her-stomach-because-it-aches-and-hurts-16x9-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/a-young-child-perhaps-a-girl-holding-her-stomach-because-it-aches-and-hurts-16x9-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Young girl experiencing stomach pain.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Patients often experience diarrhea, rectal bleeding, fatigue, weight loss, and stomach and joint pain.</p>



<p>"Some patients might develop what we call extraintestinal manifestations of their inflammatory bowel disease. And these can impact other organs. That means organs that are beyond the intestines," explains Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>There is no cure and no exact cause for IBD, but there are medications to reduce inflammation. Also, watching what you eat can help alleviate some symptoms.</p>



<p>"We have to have a focus on diets that are high in anti-inflammatory foods and antioxidants, and low in foods that are processed that can be proinflammatory, says Dr. Chedid.</p>

<p>You experience sudden, intense pain in your abdomen or back pain between your shoulder blades — maybe even nausea or vomiting. You could have gallstones.</p>



<p>"Typically, symptoms of gallbladder-related pain is pain associated with meals. Usually after you eat meals with fatty foods," says Dr. Jorge.</p>



<p>He says there are several reasons why your gallbladder can form gallstones. The most common cause is what you eat. A diet high in fiber and low in cholesterol and fat will reduce your risk.</p>



<p>"Native Americans and Hispanic populations have a higher risk of developing gallstones and so do women. And as we get older, we're at higher risk of developing gallstones," says Dr. Jorge.</p>



<p>He says, once you have gallstones, they won't go away on their own. Recommended treatment is surgery to remove your gallbladder.</p>



<p>"It's an organ that people can live without and not have any long-term consequences from," says Dr. Jorge. "We take out the gallbladder not just because it has stones, but it's because it's where most stones are formed. But there is a small percentage of patients that can develop stones within the bile ducts themselves."</p>

<p>"Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder in the United States, affecting approximately 10% of U.S. adults," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lacy-brian-e-m-d-ph-d/bio-20392407?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Brian Lacy</a>, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist.</p>



<p>The symptoms of IBS are sometimes embarrassing and can affect a person's physical and emotional well-being.</p>



<p>"Patients have symptoms of disordered defecation. And that, in some patients, means constipation, skipping days without a bowel movement, straining of a bowel movement, or diarrhea, loose, watery urgent bowel movements," says Dr. Lacy.</p>

<p>The exact cause of IBS is still unclear, but it's believed to be a combination of factors, including changes in the gut microbiome and food intolerances.</p>



<p>IBS is now categorized as a disorder of gut-brain interaction, which means there is a problem with how the gut and the brain communicate with each other.</p>



<p>"That stress, which can affect the brain, then sends signals to the gut, changing gut function and worsening your IBS symptoms," says Dr. Lacy.</p>



<p>There is no cure for IBS, but symptoms can be managed. Try eating smaller, more frequent meals, and exercising regularly. Deep breathing and yoga are also helpful to reduce stress.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When to see a doctor for irritable bowel syndrome</h3>



<p>See your healthcare professional if you have significant changes in bowel habits. Some severe symptoms include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bloody stools.</li>



<li>Unintended weight loss.</li>



<li>Unexplained vomiting.</li>
</ul>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new drug has been shown to increase healing and regeneration of the liver after major surgery, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867424002253?via%3Dihub">study published in the scientific journal Cell</a>. Researchers hope that this could lead to more surgical options for patients diagnosed with advanced liver tumors and liver failure.</p>



<p>"This research is significant because this is the first drug of its kind to show an increase in healing and regeneration of the liver after major surgery," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/nyberg-scott-l-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Nyberg, M.D., Ph.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon and co-senior author of the study. "This discovery has the potential to improve the treatment of liver failure, increase the safety of liver transplantation for living donors and potentially avoid the need for a liver transplant in some cases."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers collaborated with researchers at <a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tubingen University Hospital</a> in Germany, who led the <a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum/pressemeldungen/628?press_str=">project</a>. "Our drug candidate would not only be an urgently needed treatment option in oncological liver surgery but, by enabling safe living donor liver transplantations, also holds the promise to overcome the major problem of organ shortage in the field of liver transplantation," says Lars Zender, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author of the study from Tubingen.</p>



<p>Liver disease remains a major health concern, <a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(23)00194-0/fulltext#:~:text=Liver%20disease%20accounts%20for%20over,for%20600%2C000%20to%20900%2C000%20deaths." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">causing an estimated 2 million deaths</a> worldwide per year. While healthy livers have a nearly unlimited ability to regenerate themselves, that is not the case for livers that are damaged. As a result, surgeons treating a patient with primary liver tumors are limited in how large of a section of the liver can safely be removed to avoid liver failure.</p>



<p>The study found that a drug called HRX215 inhibits the MKK4 protein found in liver cells. That appears to trigger the self-healing function of the liver, allowing it to regenerate. Before the drug was tested in 48 healthy volunteers within the phase 1 study, it was investigated in animal models. The preclinical study was able to show that the use of HRX-215 increased liver regeneration and prevented liver failure, even after the removal of 85% of the organ. The phase 1 study found excellent safety and tolerability of the drug in people. Additional clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of the drug in humans.</p>



<p>Researchers are hopeful that this discovery will one day create more surgical options for patients with advanced liver tumors by allowing more of the liver to be safely removed. It also has the potential to benefit patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-liver-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20352863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute and chronic liver failure.</a> This drug could potentially allow for successful <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/care-at-mayo-clinic/pcc-20384845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplants</a> from a smaller portion of a healthy donor's liver, and thus posing less risk to healthy donors. Often, this liver is too small to successfully take over the function of the full-sized liver removed from the recipient. The hope would be that this drug could allow for rapid liver regeneration, creating a new safe transplant option for people struggling with liver failure. This drug also could potentially eliminate the need for a liver transplant for some patients.</p>

<p>Colorectal cancer, the third-most common cancer in the U.S., has been rising among younger people for the past two decades. It is not one type of cancer but two cancers: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colon cancer</a>, which starts in the large intestine, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rectal cancer</a>, which begins in the last part of the large intestine, known as the rectum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Derek Ebner, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/sections/overview/ovc-20348241?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gastroenterologist</a>, notes that colorectal cancer has been increasing in adults under age 50, particularly for rectal cancer.

<p>"Historically, colorectal cancer was equally divided along the colon and rectum, but particularly for those with early onset colorectal cancer — age less than 50<sub>&nbsp;</sub>— we're seeing higher rates of rectal cancer among the younger onset," says Dr. Ebner.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Warning signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Dr. Ebner says four key symptoms have been identified for people under 50 who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, seeing blood with bowel motions, as well as iron deficiency anemia," he says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="804" height="452" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg" alt="Graphic of warning signs of colorectal cancer with Mayo Clnic identifier" class="wp-image-383697" style="width:856px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg 804w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Warning signs of colorectal cancer</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Ebner notes that blood loss after bowel movements, even if not visibly apparent, can lead to low iron levels.</p>



<p>"If on a blood test, for example, we see a sign of iron deficiency, that would then prompt us to explore further," he says.</p>



<p>Even though it may be embarrassing, he stresses, "If you have any of those symptoms, you need to share it with a healthcare provider. That way, they can navigate those subsequent steps."</p>



<p>Which can lead to early treatment and better outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reducing risks of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>While it's not possible to completely prevent cancer, there are ways to reduce your risks and that includes following a healthy lifestyle.</p>



<p>"Abiding by a healthy lifestyle is critical," says Dr. Ebner. "Following a well-rounded diet,  staying physically active, for instance, perhaps can be protective. The other key, though, is just being very mindful of those symptoms, and then also underscoring the importance of screening."</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Screening</strong>: Talk to your healthcare team about colorectal cancer screening.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise</strong>: Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Eat fruits, veggies and whole grains.</li>



<li><strong>Weight</strong>: Maintain a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Don't smoke, limit alcohol consumption.</li>
