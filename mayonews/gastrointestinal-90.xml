<p>Researchers estimate that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/crohns-disease/definition-facts#common" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than half a million people</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. have Crohn’s disease, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/ulcerative-colitis/definition-facts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">600,000 to 900,000 people</a>&nbsp;in the U.S. have ulcerative colitis, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inflammatory bowel disease</a>&nbsp;is an umbrella term used to describe disorders that involve chronic inflammation of your digestive tract. For some people, inflammatory bowel disease&nbsp;is only a mild illness. For others, it can be debilitating and sometimes leads to life-threatening complications. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two types of inflammatory bowel disease.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a>&nbsp;is characterized by inflammation of the lining of your digestive tract, which often spreads deep into affected tissues. Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can involve different areas of the digestive tract in different people, most commonly the small intestine.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ulcerative colitis</a>&nbsp;causes inflammation and sores in your digestive tract. Ulcerative colitis affects the innermost lining of your large intestine, also called the colon, and rectum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Age</strong>.<br>Most people who develop&nbsp;inflammatory bowel disease are diagnosed before they're 30. But some people don't develop the disease until their 50s or 60s.</li>



<li><strong>Race or ethnicity</strong>.<br>Although&nbsp;inflammatory bowel disease&nbsp;is more common in white people, it can occur in any race. Cases are increasing in other races and ethnicities.</li>



<li><strong>Family history</strong>.<br>You're at higher risk if you have a close relative — such as a parent, sibling or child — with the disease.</li>



<li><strong>Cigarette smoking</strong>.<br>Cigarette smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing Crohn's disease. Smoking may help prevent ulcerative colitis. However, its harm to overall health outweighs any benefit, and quitting smoking can improve the general health of your digestive tract and provide many other health benefits.</li>



<li><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications</strong>.<br>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications may increase the risk of developing&nbsp;Crohn's disease&nbsp;or worsen the disease in people who already have it. These medications include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve), diclofenac sodium and others.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Inflammatory bowel disease symptoms vary depending on the severity of inflammation and where it occurs. Symptoms may range from mild to severe. You are likely to have periods of active illness followed by periods of remission.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms that are common to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Diarrhea</li>



<li>Fatigue</li>



<li>Abdominal pain and cramping</li>



<li>Blood in your stool</li>



<li>Reduced appetite</li>



<li>Unintended weight loss</li>
</ul>



<p>The symptoms of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis don't only affect you physically, though. They take an emotional toll as well. If signs and symptoms are severe, your life may revolve around a constant need to run to the toilet. Even if your symptoms are mild, it can be difficult to be out in public. All of these factors can alter your life and may lead to depression.</p>



<p>Here are some strategies for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353320?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coping and support</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Be informed.</strong><br>One of the best ways to be more in control is to learn as much as possible about inflammatory bowel disease. Look for information from reputable sources like the <a href="https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's and Colitis Foundation</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Join a support group.</strong><br>Although support groups aren't for everyone, they can provide valuable information about your condition as well as emotional support. Group members frequently know about the latest medical treatments or integrative therapies. You may also find it reassuring to be among others with inflammatory bowel disease.</li>



<li><strong>Talk to a therapist.</strong><br>Some people find it helpful to consult a mental health professional who's familiar with inflammatory bowel disease and the emotional difficulties it can cause.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/viral-gastroenteritis/multimedia/viral-gastroenteritis/img-20008146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Viral gastroenteritis</a> is an intestinal infection marked by watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea or vomiting, headache, muscle aches and sometimes fever. It's often called a stomach bug or the stomach flu, but it's not actually the flu or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a>, which is a respiratory illness. This infection often develops though contact with an infected person or by ingesting contaminated food or water.</p>



<p>An upset stomach is a common symptom of a stomach bug, which can make eating sound unappealing, even though you may be hungry. Knowing what to eat is difficult because you don't know what will agree with your stomach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Follow these tips for fueling your body when you have viral gastroenteritis:</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Let your stomach settle.</strong><br>Avoid eating solid foods for a few hours. Instead, drink liquids like broths, teas, sodas or noncaffeinated sports drinks.</li>



<li><strong>Hydrate.</strong><br>Focus on drinking in small amounts of liquid frequently to stay hydrated.</li>



<li><strong>Ease back into eating.</strong><br>After you can tolerate drinking clear fluids, start eating smaller meals of bland, low-residual foods, such as mashed potatoes, plain noodles, crackers, toast, gelatin, bananas, rice and chicken.</li>



<li><strong>Be cautious with medications.</strong><br>It's best to use over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen sparingly as they can cause an upset stomach. Discuss your medications with your healthcare team to avoid any potential side effects. If your symptoms are severe, you may need to use an over-the-counter medication to help decrease diarrhea symptoms or an anti-nausea medicine to help you keep food and fluids down with vomiting.</li>
</ul>



<p>The main complication of a stomach bug is dehydration, which is a severe loss of water and essential salts and minerals. You can lower the risk of dehydration by drinking enough fluids to replace those lost from vomiting or diarrhea.</p>



<p>Depending on the cause, viral gastroenteritis symptoms generally appear about one to three days after exposure. Symptoms can be mild or, at times, severe and last for a few days to a week.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to see a healthcare professional</h2>



<p>Although viral gastroenteritis is extremely common, it can usually be managed at home. Red flags or worrisome symptoms that would prompt a visit to your healthcare team are severe dehydration, not being able to keep fluids down, bloody stools, severe abdominal pain or when symptoms last longer than one week. Young children, older adults and people with compromised immune systems are more likely to have complications related to viral gastroenteritis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h2>



<p>Good hand hygiene and proper food handling are essential to prevent you from getting sick and to limit the spread of viral gastroenteritis within a household, school, workplace and the community. Ensure you wash your hands with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom, before preparing food and eating. Stomach bugs most commonly are seen in the winter and spring, so it's important to be diligent, especially this time of year.</p>

<p>"GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease, is when you get acid and chemical damage to the lining of the esophagus," says Dr. East.</p>



<p>You might feel a lump in the throat, have difficulty swallowing, have chest pain, a cough, or have worsening <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/is-there-a-connection-between-asthma-and-acid-reflux/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asthma-type</a> symptoms.</p>

"If this is persistent, you can develop scarring and a stricture."</p>



<p>But if it's persistent and heals, the lining of the esophagus can change to a more acid-resistant form, which is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/barretts-esophagus/symptoms-causes/syc-20352841?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barrett's esophagus</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It affects 10% to 15% of people with GERD. And a much smaller group faces another risk, says Dr. East.</p>



<p>"About 1 in 200 patients with Barrett's esophagus per year will develop <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356084?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esophageal adenocarcinoma.</a>"</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> A 62-year-old man I worked with was diagnosed with stomach cancer earlier this year. He reportedly was feeling full even after eating small meals and experienced stomach pain above his belly button. I am starting to worry because I have recently started to experience similar symptoms. I’m only 38. Is it possible I could have stomach cancer? How do I get screened? What are the treatment options?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Most people diagnosed with<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopy/about/pac-20395197?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">stomach cancer</a>, which is also called gastric cancer,&nbsp;are over the age of 60. However,&nbsp;in the U.S., stomach cancers&nbsp;in people under 40 have been steadily rising. Overall, this form of cancer is not very common, but factors that increase your risk include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eating smoked, salted, processed or charcoaled meats, and pickled vegetables.</li>



<li>Eating few or no fruits and vegetables.</li>



<li>Alcohol use.</li>



<li>Previous stomach surgery.</li>



<li>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.</li>



<li>Inherited cancer syndromes such as: hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), familial adenomatous polyposis, gastric adenoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.</li>
</ul>



<p>Unfortunately, stomach cancer doesn’t always cause symptoms in its early stages, and many symptoms may not happen until the cancer is advanced. Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Difficulty swallowing.</li>



<li>Belly pain.</li>



<li>Feeling bloated after eating.</li>



<li>Feeling full after eating small amounts of food.</li>



<li>Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry.</li>



<li>Losing weight without trying.</li>



<li>Feeling very tired.</li>



<li>Stools that look black.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you have signs and symptoms that worry you, you should make an appointment with your healthcare team. Many other conditions can cause symptoms that are similar to stomach cancer. Your healthcare team may recommend testing such as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopy/about/pac-20395197?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">upper endoscopy</a>, also called an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which is a procedure that is used to visually examine your upper digestive system. This can be used to screen for stomach cancer as the cause of your symptoms. An EGD allows the doctor to look at the inside of your stomach. Stomach cancer can appear as an ulcer, a mass or a thickening of the stomach wall. Your physician then can obtain biopsies of the area to determine if you have stomach cancer.</p>



<p>The treatment of stomach cancer depends on the stage. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopic-ultrasound/about/pac-20385171?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Endoscopic ultrasound</a>, a minimally invasive procedure to assess diseases of the digestive (gastrointestinal) tract and other nearby organs and tissues, CT or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pet-scan/about/pac-20385078?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">PET scan imaging</a>, and a staging laparoscopy are used to determine the clinical stage.</p>



<p>While it is uncommon to find early stomach cancer, treatment for early-stage disease often only requires local treatment. For example, in early stomach cancers that involve only the mucosa, or inner lining of the stomach, and measure less than 2-3 centimeters in size, the stomach cancer can be removed using endoscopic submucosal dissection without the need for surgery or additional treatment. For other early stomach cancers that do not meet these criteria, surgery to remove the stomach cancer and regional lymph nodes is recommended.</p>



<p>However, if the cancer is found to have spread to the lymph nodes at the time of surgery, then the patient is at a higher risk of stomach cancer returning after surgery alone. Therefore, chemotherapy after surgery is often recommended to decrease the risk of cancer recurrence.</p>



<p>Typically, patients are diagnosed with more advanced stomach cancer, which means a deeper involvement of the stomach or spread to regional lymph nodes. In this more common situation, combining chemotherapy and surgery is necessary for the best outcomes. Chemotherapy usually is given before and after surgery in this case.</p>



<p>Finally, if the stomach cancer has been found to have spread outside the stomach and regional lymph nodes, then this is stage 4 cancer. The primary treatment is systemic therapy. Additional testing can be done on the tumor to determine if the stomach cancer might respond to targeted therapy or immunotherapy. In some cases where there is a small amount of tumor spread to the lining of the abdomen, also called the peritoneum, surgery called cytoreductive surgery and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/more-adventures-thanks-to-advanced-cancer-care-robotic-surgery/">hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;can be used to prolong a patient’s survival.</p>



<p>Treatment options to treat stomach cancer are complex and should be individualized to your particular situation. It is essential to seek out an experienced team to help with the accurate staging of cancer, help with management decisions and for high-quality endoscopic or surgical resection.<em> —&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grotz-travis-e-m-d/bio-20342285"><strong><em>Dr. Travis Grotz</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Surgical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>More than 64,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year, and more than 50,000 people will die of the disease, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>.

Your pancreas releases enzymes that aid digestion and produces hormones that help manage your blood sugar.</p>



<p>Several types of growths can occur in the pancreas, including cancerous and noncancerous tumors. The most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which begins in the cells that line the ducts that carry digestive enzymes out of the pancreas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Signs and symptoms of&nbsp;pancreatic cancer&nbsp;often don't occur until the disease is advanced. This means the disease rarely is detected at its early stages when it's most curable.</p>



<p>Pancreatic cancer symptoms can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Abdominal pain that radiates to your back.</li>



<li>Loss of appetite or unintended weight loss.</li>



<li>Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes.</li>



<li>Light-colored stools.</li>



<li>Dark-colored urine.</li>



<li>Itchy skin.</li>



<li>New diagnosis of diabetes or existing diabetes that's becoming more difficult to control.</li>



<li>Blood clots.</li>



<li>Fatigue.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Risk Factors</strong></h2>



<p>Factors that can increase your risk of pancreatic cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Smoking.</li>



<li>Diabetes.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Reducing your risk</strong></h2>



<p>While some of these risk factors are out of your control, here are some lifestyle choices you can make to reduce your risk:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Stop smoking.<br></strong>If you smoke, try to stop. Talk to your healthcare team about strategies to help you stop, including support groups, medications and nicotine replacement therapy. If you don't smoke, don't start.</li>



<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight.<br></strong>If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain it. If you need to lose weight, aim for a slow, steady weight loss — 1 to 2 pounds a week. Combine daily exercise with a diet rich in vegetables, fruit and whole grains, with smaller portions to help you lose weight.</li>



<li><strong>Choose a healthy diet.</strong><br>A diet full of colorful fruits and vegetables, and whole grains, may reduce your risk of cancer.</li>
</ul>

For most people, the first goal of pancreatic cancer treatment is to eliminate the cancer, when possible. When that isn't an option, the focus may be on improving your quality of life and limiting the cancer from growing or causing more harm.</p>



<p>Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination of these. When pancreatic cancer is advanced and these treatments aren't likely to offer a benefit, your healthcare professional will focus on symptom relief with palliative care to keep you as comfortable as possible for as long as possible.</p>

<p>Stomach cancer is relatively rare in the U.S. It's often diagnosed at later stages in the disease, when symptoms like nausea, heartburn and feeling bloated are more pronounced.</p>



<p>"In general, when we talk about gastric cancer, we usually talk about a cancer that's arising from the lining of the stomach," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sonbol-mohamad-bassam-b-m-d/bio-20466252?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mohamad Sonbol</a>, a Mayo Clinic oncologist.</p>



<p>Early signs of stomach cancer vary, and can include abdominal pain, blood in the stool or just feeling tired.</p>



<p>"If you have a cancer in the stomach, it might ooze blood very slowly, and that can cause anemia, or low hemoglobin, and that can lead to fatigue," says Dr. Sonbol.</p>



<p>If you're a man, you're at higher risk for stomach cancer than a woman. Other risk factors include obesity, smoking and drinking alcohol.</p>



<p>"And then there are other risk factors, such as there are some hereditary syndromes or things that we inherit from our parents that put us at higher risk of developing gastric cancer, stomach cancer," says Dr. Sonbol.</p>



<p>Treatment options depend on the cancer's location in the stomach, its size and stage, but can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>"I tell patients who have recently been diagnosed with gastric cancer that there is definitely a hope because we've gotten significantly better in the last decade, and more specifically really, in the last year or two, where we have now many more treatment options than we had before," says Dr. Sonbol.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>My friend had a stoma created after years of managing Crohn's disease. She recently had surgery to repair a hernia. What is a stoma, and are these types of hernias common? What is the typical treatment?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Occasionally, the surgical treatment of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Crohn's disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">ulcerative colitis</a> and other gastrointestinal, gynecologic, or urologic conditions, both cancerous or benign, may require reconstruction or removal of the bladder, colon, or rectum. Surgeons may use other parts of the intestine to replace the function of these organs to facilitate the removal of urine or stool from the body. When this is done, the surgeon constructs a stoma, a small opening in the abdomen used to remove this body waste into a collection bag.</p>



<p>When the stoma is connected to the urinary system, it is known as an urostomy. If the stoma is releasing stool, it can be an ileostomy constructed from the small intestine or a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/multimedia/colostomy/img-20436493?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">colostomy</a> made from the colon, also known as the large intestine. Stomas may be temporary or permanent depending upon why they were constructed. If they are temporary, another operation is required to reverse them.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/ostomy/art-20045825?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">adjusting to your stoma may take some time</a>, you can lead a completely normal life with a stoma — there are really no limitations on activities.</p>



<p>Because a hole in the abdominal wall is required to construct a stoma, that hole can enlarge over time and become a hernia. An abdominal wall hernia is a condition where some abdominal tissue or part of an abdominal organ, most commonly the intestines, protrudes through the abdominal wall. From the outside, this may result in a noticeable bulge. Hernias may cause no symptoms or become quite symptomatic as they enlarge. Discomfort or pain with activity is the most common symptom of an abdominal wall hernia. Occasionally, hernias containing a portion of the intestine may result in an intestinal obstruction which can be life-threatening and require emergency surgery.</p>



<p>A hernia associated with a stoma is known as a parastomal hernia. Like other abdominal wall hernias, parastomal hernias result in a noticeable bulge and can have similar symptoms. However, parastomal hernias can be very problematic for patients because the bulging around the stoma frequently interferes with the function of the appliance that collects the waste material. If the appliance seal fails, then waste material will leak out onto the skin. Parastomal hernia repair not only improves the function of the collection pouch, but it also improves the appearance of the abdominal wall.</p>



<p>Most patients who have a parastomal hernia may be candidates for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/robotic-surgery/about/pac-20394974?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">robotic surgery</a> to repair the hernia. Robotic repair typically results in improved outcomes with a shorter hospital stay and quicker recovery than open repairs. Robotic surgery can lead to lower rates of complications.</p>



<p>Parastomal hernias can be repaired, but it requires a higher level of surgical training and experience to perform a long-lasting repair of the abdominal wall without compromising the function of the stoma. It's important for patients to seek out care at a high-volume hospital, like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/colon-rectal-surgery/home/orc-20312712?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Mayo Clinic</a>, to lower the recurrence rate of future hernias. <em>— <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cima-robert-r-m-d/bio-20054531?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Dr. Robert Cima</a></strong>, </em><strong><em>Colon and Rectal Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>Dietary fiber, also known as roughage or bulk, includes the parts of plant foods your body can't digest or absorb. Unlike other food components, such as fats, proteins or carbohydrates — which your body breaks down and absorbs — fiber isn't digested by your body. Instead, it passes relatively intact through your stomach, small intestine and colon and out of your body. Fiber is commonly classified as soluble, which dissolves in water, or insoluble, which doesn't dissolve.</p>



<p>The recommended amount of dietary fiber is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories per day, or about 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men each day, according to the <a href="https://www.eatright.org/health/essential-nutrients/carbohydrates/fiber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a>.</p>



<p>The amount of fiber your body needs may vary depending on your energy needs. It also can depend on certain health conditions you may have.</p>

<p>In particular, a high-fiber diet:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Normalizes bowel movements.</strong><br>Dietary fiber increases the weight and size of your stool and softens it. A bulky stool is easier to pass, decreasing your chance of constipation. If you have loose, watery stools, fiber may help to solidify the stool because it absorbs water and adds bulk to the stool.</li>



<li><strong>Helps maintain bowel health.</strong><br>A high-fiber diet may lower your risk of developing hemorrhoids and small pouches in your colon (diverticular disease). Studies have also found that a high-fiber diet likely lowers the risk of colorectal cancer. Some fiber is fermented in the colon. Researchers are looking at how this may play a role in preventing colon diseases.</li>



<li><strong>Lowers cholesterol levels.</strong><br>Soluble fiber found in beans, oats, flaxseed and oat bran may help lower total blood cholesterol levels by lowering low-density lipoprotein, or "bad," cholesterol levels. Studies also have shown that high-fiber foods may have other heart-health benefits, such as reducing blood pressure and inflammation.</li>



<li><strong>Helps control blood sugar levels.</strong><br>In people with diabetes, fiber — particularly soluble fiber — can slow the absorption of sugar and help improve blood sugar levels. A healthy diet that includes insoluble fiber also may reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</li>



<li><strong>Aids in achieving healthy weight.</strong><br>High-fiber foods tend to be more filling than low-fiber foods, so you're likely to eat less and stay satisfied longer eating high-fiber foods. And high-fiber foods tend to take longer to eat and are less "energy dense," which means they have fewer calories for the same volume of food.</li>



<li><strong>Helps you live longer.</strong><br>Studies suggest that increasing your dietary fiber intake — especially cereal fiber — is associated with a reduced risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and all cancers.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px">Why you might need less fiber in your diet</h2>



<p>Some of the reasons your healthcare team might recommend a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/low-fiber-diet/art-20048511?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-fiber diet</a> include:</p>



<ul>
<li>You have narrowing of the bowel. This may be due to a tumor or an inflammatory disease, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a>.</li>



<li>You have had bowel surgery.</li>



<li>You are having treatment that damages or irritates your digestive system. For example, radiation can cause irritation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Eating a low-fiber diet will limit your bowel movements. It may help reduce diarrhea or other symptoms, such as stomach pain. After a short time, you may be able to slowly introduce fiber into your diet again.</p>



<p>Because a low-fiber diet limits what you can eat, it can be difficult to meet your nutritional needs. You should follow a low-fiber diet only as long as directed by your healthcare team.</p>



<p>If you must continue eating this diet for a longer time, consult a registered dietitian. A dietitian can help make sure you are meeting all your nutritional needs.</p>

<p><em>Algorithm seeks to address 'last-mile' barrier by identifying disease when cure still possible</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&nbsp;Estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. by 2030, pancreatic cancer has a grim prognosis with nearly 70% of patients facing mortality within the first year of diagnosis. Unfortunately, 40% of small pancreatic cancers elude detection on CT scans until they've advanced to an incurable stage.</p>



<p>This creates a critical "last-mile" barrier for early detection efforts where, in most patients — including those high-risk subjects undergoing active screening — imaging detects the cancer at a stage when a cure is unlikely. This makes imaging the final frontier in the quest for early cancer detection.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(23)04958-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent breakthrough</a>, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers used the world's most extensive imaging dataset to build a versatile artificial intelligence (AI) model that has shown the potential for autonomous detection of pancreatic cancer on standard CTs when surgical intervention can still promise a cure.</p>



<p>"This is where the study emerges as a beacon of hope," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/goenka-ajit-h-m-d/bio-20152402?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ajit H. Goenka, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiologist and principal investigator and corresponding author. "It addresses the last-mile challenge — detecting the cancer at a stage when the cancer is even beyond the scope of experts."</p>



<p>The group developed a highly accurate AI model, trained on the largest — more than 3,000 patients — and most diverse CT dataset, for fully automated cancer detection, including small and otherwise difficult-to-detect tumors. Published in <a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gastroenterology</a>, the journal of the American Gastroenterological Association, the study not only builds on the group's recent work on <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ai-applied-to-prediagnostic-cts-may-help-diagnose-pancreatic-cancer-at-earlier-more-treatable-stage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiomics-based early detection models</a> but also underscores Mayo Clinic's standing as a beacon of innovation in AI healthcare solutions.</p>

<p>Most important, the model could detect visually imperceptible cancer from normal-appearing pancreases on prediagnostic CT images (i.e., those acquired at three to 36 months prior to clinical diagnosis) substantially early — a median of 438 days — before clinical diagnosis.</p>



<p>"These findings suggest that AI has the potential to detect hidden cancers in asymptomatic individuals, allowing for surgical treatment at a stage when a cure is still achievable," Dr. Goenka says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the model remained reliable and accurate across diverse patient groups and variations in scanning equipment and imaging techniques. This resilience is crucial for the model's utility in a wide array of real-world medical scenarios.</p>



<p>Addressing a major concern in the AI healthcare landscape, the team also deconstructed the AI's decision-making process to ensure transparency, acknowledging that trust and quality control are essential for AI's broader clinical acceptance.</p>



<p>"We owe the progress to the ingenious efforts of the Framework for AI Software Technology, or FAST, team led by Panagiotis Korfiatis, Ph.D., complemented by our team of exceptionally bright research fellows and data science analysts," says Dr. Goenka. "They dedicated months to meticulous preparation for our initial submission and invested significant effort to astutely address the incisive queries of the panel of international reviewers."</p>



<p>"We're only at the beginning but stand ready to address the challenges of early cancer detection, leveraging the capabilities of AI and next-generation molecular imaging in conjunction with complementary biomarkers," he adds.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has already initiated the steps for clinical validation and the models are undergoing regulatory processes. With backing from the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, the team is set to undertake benefactor-funded prospective screening trials.

<p>Gluten is a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. In coeliac disease, eating gluten triggers an autoimmune reaction that causes cell damage to the small intestine. This in turn can cause <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diarrhoea</a>,&nbsp; fatigue, weight loss, bloating, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351360?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anaemia</a> and other problems and lead to serious complications.</p>



<p>Gluten intolerance is more common, Dr. Sami says. It is comparable to an intolerance to dairy, onions or garlic, he adds.</p>



<p>"In gluten intolerance, there is no cell damage or inflammation. It's more of a sensitivity: 'Gluten doesn't agree with me,'" Dr. Sami says. "If you eat gluten and have an immediate reaction, such as diarrhoea, that's more likely to be gluten intolerance than coeliac disease, which is a slow process that you don't tend to feel immediately."</p>



<p>One sign that someone has gluten intolerance or coeliac disease is the presence of one or more gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, bloating or heartburn that diminish or go away if gluten is removed from the diet and come back if the person resumes eating foods with gluten, Dr. Sami says. If this happens, it is important to be tested in case it is the more serious coeliac disease, he adds.</p>



<p>Addressing gluten intolerance may be as simple as cutting back on foods containing gluten rather than eliminating them completely, Dr. Sami says.</p>



<p>"It depends on the intolerance level. Some people may be fine by halving the gluten intake, while others may need to cut down more," Dr. Sami says. "It's different from coeliac disease, where you have to be strictly, completely, gluten-free."</p>



<p>Diagnosing coeliac disease typically starts with a blood test to determine whether the body views gluten as an invader and is generating high levels of antibodies to protect itself. If a blood test is positive, an imaging test called endoscopy is used to take biopsies to check for damage in the small intestine.</p>



<p>"We typically recommend that people should not be on a gluten-free diet if they are being tested for coeliac disease, because that can create false negative results on the blood test," Dr. Sami says.</p>



<p>For the majority of patients diagnosed with coeliac disease, eliminating gluten keeps it under control, Dr. Sami says. But without a coeliac diagnosis, there is no reason to eliminate gluten.</p>



<p>"There's no evidence that a gluten-free diet by itself is healthier," Dr. Sami says. "It's not about the gluten. Take a biscuit, for example: It's more about the fat and the sugar in the biscuit, rather than the gluten." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
