<p>There is a study of the fascinating interplay between the cumulative effects of external exposures on a person's body and genes. It is called exposomics. Learn why you need to recognize that people are exposed to hundreds or thousands of things per day, and why it’s important to study that complexity.</p>



<p>Featured experts on this week's Tomorrow's Cure episode are <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights?mc_id=global&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=tcepisodeone&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=global&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=185872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Konstantinos Lazaridis</a>, the Carlson and Nelson Endowed Executive Director for Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine; and <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/gary-w-miller-phd?mc_id=global&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=tcepisodeone&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=global&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=185872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gary Miller</a>, vice dean of Research Strategy and Innovation at Mailman School of Public Health, and director of the Center for Innovative Exposomics at Columbia University.</p>



<p>"Genetics has explained a lot, but there’s a gap there," says Dr. Miller. "If you want to explain complex diseases, you need to look at all the things that contribute to it."</p>



<p>"It's not the dramatic exposure that happens once in a lifetime. It's those small events that happen every day over five years, 10 years that created the problem," says Dr. Lazaridis. "How can we reverse that?"</p>



<p>"The exposome is designed to capture as many of the exposures as possible. And it's not just the ones we would think that would be negative. It's the positive ones as well. So when you eat your breakfast, there's a lot of nutrients and vitamins there. That's good. But there might be pesticide residues or plastic residues on it. You might have air pollution or allergens in the air that you're breathing," says Dr. Miller. &nbsp;"We're looking at all the things that people get exposed to. I like to think about it as the compilation of all the physical, biological, chemical and psychosocial influences on our health."</p>

<p>It's normal for kids to feel anxious sometimes. When these feelings get too big and help is needed, experts often suggest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610">cognitive behavioral therapy.</a>&nbsp; According to a recent&nbsp;study&nbsp;at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic, guiding kids through parent-coached exposure therapy can be more effective.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/whiteside-stephen-p-ph-d-l-p/bio-20054748">Dr. Stephen Whiteside</a>, a psychologist with the Mayo Clinic Children's Center and lead author of the study, says exposure therapy helps kids face their fears more effectively than talk therapy, often requiring fewer sessions.</p>

<p>"One of the most common fears that we see is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/social-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353561">social anxiety disorder,</a>" says Dr. Whiteside.</p>



<p>He says it's more than just a child being shy. For instance, they may fear people are going to judge them if they make mistakes.</p>



<p>"It makes it very hard for them to meet new kids and make friends. They're very nervous to talk in class or ask for help when they need it. They don't want to join activities because they're just so shy and afraid that something bad is going to happen," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When exposure therapy is appropriate</h2>



<p>If it is affecting daily life, exposure therapy may help.</p>



<p>"And so the treatment involves helping kids learn through their own experience that what they're afraid of is not as dangerous or not as bad as they think it's going to be," explains Dr. Whiteside.</p>



<p>He says kids will be more successful if they have someone to help them, typically a parent.</p>



<p>"Parent-coach exposure therapy is simply working with kids and parents together to help them learn how to help the child face their fears," Dr. Whiteside says.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal with exposure therapy is simple.</p>



<p>"We help kids face their fears very early in treatment so that we can help them get better as quickly as possible," says Dr. Whiteside.</p>

<p>Of the burns and injuries reported in 2023, teenagers made up the highest rate of emergency department visits due to fireworks, followed by children ages 5 to 9, according to the CPSC. All fireworks, including sparklers, are potentially dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If families are going to partake in firework activities, they must exercise extreme caution. These are highly explosive and can cause <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/burns/symptoms-causes/syc-20370539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burns</a>. If they are going to do that, make sure it's in a safe place, that it's an adult handling the fireworks and have experience with the proper tools," says Dr. Bracamonte. "I would highly advise that everyone use extreme caution and that no children be allowed to play with fireworks due to the explosive nature and the risk for injury."&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you or a family member do experience a burn or have an accident, take action to ensure prompt treatment if necessary.<br><br>"It's important to make sure that that person is safe and that the areas are cleansed with water immediately. And that, if necessary, you seek emergency evaluation. Fireworks are not just generally fire, it's also a chemical and an explosive. Therefore, the injury can be double-fold with a fire injury and a chemical burn," he adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips to avoid injuries from fireworks</h2>



<p>Talk with your kids about using fireworks and sparklers, and follow these safety tips:</p>



<ul>
<li>Never allow young children to handle fireworks.</li>



<li>Always have adult supervision.</li>



<li>Wear protective eyewear.</li>



<li>Never hold lighted fireworks in your hands.</li>



<li>Don't point or throw fireworks at another person.</li>



<li>Only light one firework at a time.</li>



<li>Watch them from a safe distance.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Fireworks are explosive. They contain chemicals and heat, a deadly combination that can cause serious injury. It's important to have a conversation with children, knowing that when children are out, different activities may ensue. It's important that they are appropriately educated about the risks of playing with fireworks," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<p>"The biggest question I get is, 'When can I get back to life after surgery?' A lot of the patients that we care for have families and have jobs, and responsibilities outside of their own health," says Dr. Wasson.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Medical advancements help recovery from surgery</h2>



<p>Balancing self-care and caring for others can be tough for patients. Quicker recovery time due to surgical advancements has helped.</p>

<p>"The advances that we've had in technology when it comes to surgical procedures have really pushed the envelope and allowed us to do the majority of gynecologic procedures through a minimally invasive approach," Dr. Wasson says.</p>



<p>Downtime as you recover from surgery can be a day or weeks, depending on the type of procedure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"But we do want normal physical activity to start even the day of surgery because that really helps maintain strength. It helps maintain normal body function, helps speed along the recovery," says Dr. Wasson.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing for surgery</h2>



<p>Recovery also can depend on preparation. Go in as healthy as you can be.</p>



<p>"The less stress you have, the better your diet is, the more rests that you've been getting, the more exercise — that's going to support your body for the stress of surgery, which in turn is going to help speed along the recovery," she says.</p>



<p>And, finally, Dr. Wasson says don't be afraid to ask for a helping hand.</p>



<p>"After surgery, be prepared for needing a little bit of help, needing a little bit of assistance until the pain and the fatigue lifts," she says. "It's very normal to need a little bit of help, and you just want to be prepared for that."</p>

<p>When it comes to melons, which one is your favorite? Whether it's cantaloupe, honeydew or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-wonders-of-watermelon">watermelon</a>, these summertime favorites contain some sweet health benefits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smart snack, rich in nutrients</strong></h2>



<p>Cantaloupe and honeydew melons belong to the muskmelon family and first grew in the Middle East. Watermelon originated in Africa. All three melons have a wide range of varieties. Look for varieties you haven't tried before and introduce yourself and your family to something new.</p>



<p>Here's how melons stack up nutritionally:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cantaloupe.</strong></h3>



<p>A one-cup serving of cantaloupe has only 53 calories, but it contains 106% of the daily recommended value for vitamin A&nbsp;and 95% of the daily recommended value for vitamin C. It's also a good source of potassium and folate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Honeydew.</strong></h3>



<p>One cup of honeydew has 60 calories, 51% of the daily recommended value for vitamin C&nbsp;and 11% of the daily recommended value for potassium. Honeydew also contains fiber, folate and vitamin B6.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Watermelon.</strong></h3>



<p>Watermelon is the lowest in calories, with 46 calories per one-cup serving. It's loaded with the antioxidant <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/eat-the-rainbow-for-good-health">lycopene</a>, which is linked to decreased risk of cancer, heart disease and age-related eye disorders. It also contains vitamins A and C and potassium.</p>



<p>Because melons are high in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/water-essential-to-your-body-video">water</a> and contain potassium, they're fantastic choices for maintaining <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/6-ways-to-manage-high-blood-pressure">healthy blood pressure</a> levels.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to choose the pick of the crop</strong></h2>



<p>How do you pick the perfect melon? Choose a firm melon with no obvious bruising and one that's heavy for its size, which gives a clue to how juicy it is. Watermelon is best when it has a yellow belly, indicating it could have ripened in the field instead of the store or marketplace. One variety of honeydew melon — the Santa Claus — turns yellow as it ripens. The more yellow it is, the sweeter the flavor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prepping melons and serving ideas</strong></h2>



<p>Uncut melon can be stored at room temperature. Before cutting, wash the melon under running water and gently scrub the exterior with a brush to remove soil or contamination. After cutting into the melon, remove the fruit from the rind. Then, store the chunks or slices in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days. Or, after cutting larger melons such as watermelon, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to five days.</p>



<p>While a juicy slice of melon is refreshing and nutritious all on its own, here are other ideas for serving melons:</p>



<ul>
<li>Add melon chunks to the mix when making your favorite fruit smoothie.</li>



<li>Grill slices of cantaloupe or honeydew on a hot grill for one to two minutes on each side, which enhances their sweet flavor. Serve as a side with chicken, pork or fish or top with a scoop of ice cream for dessert.</li>



<li>Make melon kabobs by threading grapes, melon and cheese cubes onto skewers for a fun snack or easy appetizer. Refrigerate until you're ready to serve them.</li>



<li>Puree melon with a pinch of sugar and a splash of lime juice to make frozen pops. Pour the mixture into molds and freeze.</li>



<li>Infuse water by chilling it with melon slices for a flavored summertime beverage with no added sugar.</li>
</ul>



<p>Try this quick, cool, creamy melon salad for breakfast, lunch or dessert. For a plant-based version, use a yogurt substitute.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creamy Spiced Melon Salad</strong></h3>



<p>By Mayo Clinic</p>



<p>Serves 4</p>



<ul>
<li>2 cups diced assorted melon, such as cantaloupe, honeydew or watermelon</li>



<li>1/2 cup plain or vanilla low-fat or nonfat yogurt</li>



<li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>



<li>1/8 teaspoon clove</li>



<li>1/8 teaspoon cinnamon</li>



<li>Orange zest (about 1 tablespoon) and juice (about 3 tablespoons)</li>



<li>In a large bowl, mix all ingredients to combine. Serve cold.</li>
</ul>



<p>Nutrition per serving (½ cup): 52 calories, trace total fat, 31 milligrams sodium, 11 grams total carbohydrate, 0 grams added sugars, 1 gram fiber, 2 grams protein.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="660" height="370" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow16x9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389784" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow16x9.jpg 660w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow16x9-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>A trip to Disney World in 2023 was an eye-opener for Katie Crow. It wasn't the rides, parades or immersive activities that caught her attention but that she struggled to have the energy to go to the amusement park every day.</p>



<p>"It wasn't the experience I wanted it to be. That's when I knew I finally needed to do something about my weight," says Katie, an endoscopy nurse with Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Crosse</a>, Wisconsin.</p>



<p>That summer, the 36-year-old saw her weight reach 296 pounds. Katie suffered from leg and back pain, had been diagnosed with severe <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/do-i-have-sleep-apnea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep apnea</a>, and her energy was at an all-time low. She also worried about developing diabetes and heart disease, which run in her family. Since 2019, she also had been coping with anxiety and depression.</p>



<p>"The worst part was I couldn't keep up with my kids," says Katie, the mother of three children, now ages 15, 13 and 3. "I was just surviving."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exploring the options</h2>



<p>No stranger to battling her weight, Katie had tried a slew of diets, but none were successful. In the spring of 2023, her primary care provider referred her to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/bariatric-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric Surgery Department</a> at Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse. There she learned about her options, which included <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-skinny-on-weight-loss-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss drugs</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a>.</p>



<p>"I considered the weight-loss drugs, but at the time, some hadn't been approved yet, and given the side effects, they didn't seem like an option for me," says Katie. "But the statistics showing the success of bariatric surgery sounded promising."</p>



<p>Katie hadn't decided on her next steps, and then came the Disney World trip. The trip turned out to be the push she needed to finalize her decision to proceed with surgery, even though she was nervous about the permanent nature of the procedure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing weight-loss surgery</h2>



<p>With the decision made, Katie started her bariatric surgery journey, which included various consultations, a psychological examination and a two-week pre-op diet to prepare her body for the surgery. She also met with <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/kathriena-greenwell-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathriena Greenwell, M.D.</a>, who would perform the surgery.</p>



<p>"Dr. Greenwell took the time to answer all my questions and thoroughly explain the risks and benefits," says Katie.</p>



<p>"Katie was an excellent candidate for surgery. Since the surgery, she's been very motivated in her weight-loss goals, dedicated to the weight-management program and is taking her lifestyle changes seriously," says Dr. Greenwell.</p>



<p>In December 2023, Katie underwent surgery. While her body healed, she was on a restricted diet for six weeks.</p>



<p>"I thought I'd never eat real food again," says Katie. "But I'd made the commitment and was determined to make it work."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making lifestyle changes</h2>



<p>When she made her choice, Katie knew that this was a lifelong commitment. She decided to track her experience on social media, posting about the ups and downs of her weight loss and the changes she was making. The most noticeable was the pounds she was shedding. In five months, Katie lost 109 pounds and 84 inches off her body. She'd dropped from size 3X to large.</p>



<p>There were other changes, as well. Dr. Greenwell says Katie's&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank">body mass index, or BMI</a>, has decreased from 49.26 to 31, and she no longer is considered morbidly obese. Dr. Greenwell also noted that Katie has stopped experiencing gastric reflux and anticipates that as she loses more weight, she won't require a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine to treat her sleep apnea.</p>



<p>"Hopefully, by losing weight now while she's young, it will prevent her from developing the complications of obesity, including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension," says Dr. Greenwell.</p>



<p>Katie also has seen other personal victories beyond the numbers on the scale. Her leg and back pain are gone, she doesn't worry if a chair will hold her when she sits down, and she delights in shopping for clothes wherever she wants. Her anxiety and depression also have subsided.</p>



<p>"I have more energy than before," says Katie. "My goal is to get down to 150 pounds, but based on the way I feel now, I'd be happy staying at this weight. Bariatric surgery is a tool, but you still have to do the work every day. It requires mental toughness and dedication; I didn't realize how challenging it would be mentally."</p>



<p>For those considering weight-loss surgery, Katie advises researching the process and understanding the commitment you'll be making.</p>



<p>"Going in, you know that you're going to be on vitamins and supplements forever, you won't be able to tolerate certain foods, you need to monitor your protein and hydration, and you have to become a regular exerciser," says Katie. "But ultimately, you have to look at the bigger picture.</p>



<p>"I'm no longer just surviving; I'm thriving. I've become the mom I always dreamt of being," she says. "My only regret is that I didn't do this sooner."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/how-extreme-heat-and-humidity-affect-your-health/">How extreme heat and humidity affect your health</a></h2>



<p>Oppressive heat and humidity can prevent the body from cooling down, increasing the risk of heat cramps, exhaustion and heatstroke. Seeking care promptly for heat-related illnesses is crucial. You should try to cool down quickly, drink cool fluids and stay out of the heat until your symptoms get better. ⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-can-music-help-someone-with-alzheimers-disease/">Can music help someone with Alzheimer's disease?</a></h2>



<p>Musical memories often are preserved in Alzheimer's disease because key brain areas linked to musical memory are relatively undamaged by the disease. Research suggests that listening to or singing songs can provide emotional and behavioral benefits for people with Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-does-expired-sunscreen-still-work/">Does expired sunscreen still work?</a></h2>



<p>One way to protect your skin from the sun is to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor, or SPF, of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Before you reach for that old bottle of sunscreen, find out if the expiration date really matters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/dengue-fever-a-mayo-clinic-expert-explains-the-mosquito-borne-infection/">Mayo Clinic expert discusses dengue fever amid CDC warning of increased risk</a></h2>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning of an increased risk of dengue fever in the U.S. Dengue fever is a potentially life-threatening viral infection transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ready-to-run-mayo-physician-and-runner-suggests-ways-to-beat-the-heat-while-running-this-spring/">Mayo physician and runner suggests ways to beat the heat while running</a></h2>

<p>EAU CLAIRE, Wis. ― When the weather has you enthused about fitness, the last thing you want is to be sidelined with joint pain.</p>



<p>"People might associate joint aches and pains with an older age group, but joint pain can affect people in all stages of life," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/amy-rantala-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Rantala, M.D.,</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/sports-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sports Medicine</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a>. "This can be frustrating because pain can be a barrier to maintaining regular exercise and enjoying being active in sports or other activities."</p>



<p>Preventing joint pain in the first place is the best course. A good first step if you want to join a sport or up your exercise goals is to check with your primary care provider or see a sports medicine specialist who can assess your overall fitness level, general mobility and if you have current injuries or pain.</p>



<p>They also may conduct a functional movement screening to evaluate how you move and pinpoint specific issues. For example, you may have decreased range of motion in a hip or shoulder or are stronger on one side than the other. This screening can identify specific rehabilitative exercises that can be done along with your regular exercise program. These exercises help your body move safely, perform exercises correctly, and reduce the risk for injury.</p>



<p>"When you do build an exercise program, make sure it's sustainable and incorporates cardio, strength building and flexibility," says Dr. Rantala. "Then ease your way into it. Don't go from 0 to 100 overnight because that can lead to injuries and sore joints."</p>



<p><strong>Some additional points to keep in mind:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Listen to your body. Don't overdo it. Take a break or tone down your activity for the rest of the day.</li>



<li>Keep a small problem small. If you're feeling recurring pain, get it checked out.</li>



<li>Build in time to recover between activity sessions. Our bodies need this time to rebuild and repair.</li>



<li>Work around your limitations. For example, if you have knee pain, using a reverse lunge or hex-bar squat helps reduces stress on your knees and allows you to target the same muscle groups.</li>
</ul>



<p>"If joint pain begins to restrict the activities you love, the best thing to do is consult an orthopedic or sports medicine specialist so the two of you can map out a plan for diagnosis and treatment to keep you active and enjoying your life," says Dr. Rantala. "Focus on playing the long game when it comes to sports and regular exercise by finding what works for your body long-term."</p>

<p>Every year, thousands of people are admitted into emergency departments across the country because of injuries caused by fireworks.</p>



<p>"We'll see injuries to fingers or the whole hand. Another common injury is burns. And sometimes we'll see eye injuries because of the sparks that fly into the eye," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/raukar-neha-p-m-d-m-s/bio-20451153?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Neha Raukar</a>, a Mayo Clinic emergency medicine physician.</p>



<p>If consumer fireworks are legal where you live, here are a few tips from the <a href="https://www.nsc.org/home-safety/tools-resources/seasonal-safety/summer/fireworks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Safety Council</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Never allow young children to handle fireworks.</li>



<li>Always have adult supervision.</li>



<li>Wear protective eyewear.</li>



<li>Never hold lighted fireworks in your hands.</li>



<li>Don't point or throw fireworks at another person.</li>



<li>Only light one firework at a time.</li>



<li>Watch them from a safe distance.</li>
</ul>



<p>"If you're going to have some fireworks, don't be drinking at the same time. Have the person who is not drinking be the one to light the fireworks. Stay away from them once you light them, and just be aware of your surroundings," says Dr. Raukar. "I don't want to meet you here in the emergency department."</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.asp">warning</a> of an increased risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dengue-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20353078">dengue fever</a> in the U.S.</p>



<p>Dengue fever is a potentially life-threatening viral infection transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes.</p>



<p>The CDC issued a health alert, saying a higher-than-expected number of dengue fever cases have been reported in the U.S. Puerto Rico declared a health emergency with 1,498 cases reported. Among U.S. travelers, 745 cases were identified this year as of June 24.</p>



<p>The U.S. health alert comes as global outbreaks of dengue fever are on the rise, with a total of 9.7 million cases reported in Latin American countries since the beginning of 2024, more than twice the number recorded in all of 2023 (4.6 million).</p>



<p>"Four different subtypes of the virus can cause infections in humans," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rizza-stacey-a-m-d/bio-20054180?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stacey Rizza</a>, a Mayo Clinic infectious diseases specialist. "Wherever you have a significant number of mosquitoes and warm hot environments is where you see dengue transmission."</p>

<p>Approximately half of the world's population lives in areas vulnerable to dengue fever, particularly in hot and humid tropical and subtropical climates.</p>



<p>"That's why you see it in parts of the world such as Southeast Asia, South America, the Caribbean, and even some parts of the southern U.S., around Florida and Louisiana.," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>The primary transmitter of dengue fever is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, known to bite during both day and night. About 1 in 4 people infected with the virus will experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of dengue fever</h2>



<p>"They usually notice fevers, body aches, bone aches, muscle aches; many times, they even describe an aching behind their eyes. They can get some nausea, vomiting and even diarrhea," Dr. Rizza says.</p>



<p>While most people recover within about a week, severe cases can lead to life-threatening emergencies.</p>



<p>Symptoms of severe dengue fever may include:</p>



<p>• Severe stomach pain.<br>• Persistent vomiting.<br>• Bleeding from your gums or nose.<br>• Blood in your urine, stool or vomit.<br>• Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising.<br>• Difficult or rapid breathing.<br>• Fatigue.<br>• Irritability or restlessness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no medicine to treat dengue fever.</p>



<p>"There's no antiviral or no treatment for dengue fever," she says. "It's what we call supportive therapy. Maintaining good hydration, particularly as people are sick and having fevers, is important. They can use acetaminophen to take care of the fevers, bring down the temperature, and then ensure they take in fluids and still get some form of eating."</p>



<p>"If they become severely ill and aren't able to keep up with their fluid status, they should go to their hospital and may require hospitalization to help support them," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>Though there is no direct treatment, a vaccine is approved in many countries for children ages 9-16 who have previously shown evidence of dengue infection. Dr. Rizza says the vaccine is not approved in the U.S.</p>



<p>"You give it to people who have already had immunologic evidence of a previous dengue infection, and then you give it to them to help prevent them from becoming reinfected," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h2>



<p>Preventing mosquito bites is vital to avoiding dengue fever. Here are some strategies:</p>



<p>• Use bug spray with DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus to prevent mosquito bites.<br>• Remove any stagnant water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.<br>• Eliminate items that hold water, such as vases and flowerpot saucers.<br>• Ensure intact window screens and closed doors to keep mosquitoes outside.<br>• Wear protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants.</p>



<p>The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for several viral infections, including dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika.</p>
