<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Two common types of inflammatory bowel disease</h3>



<p>IBD is a broad term for chronic inflammation of your digestive tract. Two types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</p>



<p>â€œUlcerative colitis really tends to only involve the colon and be more of a superficial type inflammation; whereas Crohn's disease can impact anything in the intestine, essentially, from the mouth all the way down to the anus," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<p>She says diet alone does not cause IBD. While some foods may reduce symptoms, there is no one proven diet to control inflammation.</p>



<p>"The right diet is probably different for each individual, based on the type of IBD that they have, the location of their disease, whether they've had surgeries or other complications," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Young Hispanic or Latina woman cuts vegetables, bowl of fruit" class="wp-image-373059" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1.jpg 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Diet recommendations for inflammatory bowel disease depend on the indivdual. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid ultraprocessed foods, added sugars and animal fats. And drink plenty of fluid to stay hydrated.</p>



<p>Diet does not replace medical treatment. Dr. Johnson says there are effective <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20353325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> options, so it is important to work with your healthcare provider.</p>



<p>"The tenant of therapy we have are immune-suppressing-type therapies that try to target that inappropriate response to the intestines and then calm down that inflammation within the gut," she says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>I'm pregnant with my second child. During the 20-week anatomy scan, my obstetrician detected my baby has a cleft lip. Does this mean my baby also has a cleft palate? How and when is a cleft lip or cleft palate corrected?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cleft-palate/symptoms-causes/syc-20370985?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleft lip and cleft palate</a> are openings or splits in the upper lip, the roof of the mouth â€” called the palate â€” or both. Cleft lip and cleft palate occur when the facial structures that are developing in an unborn baby don't close completely. While a cleft lip can form independently, it's more commonly found in combination with a cleft palate.</p>



<p>These are among the most common birth defects. Typically, cleft lip and palate happen in isolation, but occasionally, it is part of a genetic syndrome that includes cleft lip or cleft palate as one of its signs. Cleft lip and palate also can be associated with heart conditions, which often can be screened for and identified prenatally. It is important to be assessed by a genetic counselor to rule out any inherited diseases.</p>



<p>Generally, a cleft lip is repaired around the time when a child is 10 to 12 weeks old to ensure your child has established their feeding pattern and shows good weight gain. To close the separation in your child's lip, the surgeon makes incisions on both sides of the cleft and creates flaps of tissue. The flaps and lip muscles are then stitched together. This approach improves the lip's appearance, structure and function.</p>



<p>For a cleft palate, the repair is usually planned when the child is between 10 and 12 months old. The wait from birth to surgery for a cleft palate is longer because it allows more time for the mouth to grow. To close and rebuild the roof of the mouth requires access to a small space in the littlest of patients.</p>



<p>Children diagnosed with cleft palate are monitored closely for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20351616?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ear infections</a>. A cleft palate can affect the function of the eustachian tube, a small tube connecting your middle ear down to your throat. The muscles of your palate help open and close your eustachian tubes. Babies are assessed for the development of chronic fluid in the middle ear and a hearing test is performed to assess your child's ability to hear. Ear tubes may be placed at the time of the cleft lip surgery or, if present, at the time of the cleft palate surgery. Sometimes ear tubes can be placed in an office setting under no anesthesia.</p>



<p>In preparation for their cleft lip or palate repair surgery, your child may be a candidate for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ask-the-mayo-mom-healing-from-cleft-lip-and-cleft-palate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nasoalveolar molding</a>, a nonsurgical option that helps reduce the gap in the upper lip and cleft on the roof of the mouth. It also can reshape your child's nostrils. Surgery is performed after the molding is complete at around 3 to 4 months. Nasoalveolar molding can significantly improve your child's outcomes and reduce their need for additional corrective operations as they grow.</p>



<p>Having a baby born with a cleft lip or palate can be concerning, but these conditions can be corrected. Advancements in operations result in better outcomes for your child by improving function and reducing scarring. However, it is important to seek treatment from centers such as Mayo Clinic, which specializes in treating cleft lip and palate.</p>



<p>Mayo's team at the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cleft-craniofacial-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20511135?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleft and Craniofacial Clinic in Minnesota</a> employs a multispecialty approach to address each patient's individualized needs. Directed by plastic surgeons, the team may include specialists in ear, nose and throat (ENT), oral surgery, orthodontics, lactation, speech, hearing, psychology, genetics, social services and others. Together, this team treats hundreds of children each year who have cleft lip and palate. <em><span style="color: #000000">â€”Â </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mardini-samir-m-d/bio-20054870?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dr. Samir Mardini</strong></a><strong>, Plastic Surgery and </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/gibreel-waleed-m-b-b-s/bio-20505921?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dr. Waleed Gibreel</strong></a><strong>, Plastic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</strong></em></p>

<p>CHETEK, Wis. â€“ The hustle and bustle of the holiday season can be a fun, exciting time. However, holiday decorations, parties and cold weather can pose threats to children.</p>



<p>"The dÃ©cor, the gifts and the fun outdoor activities can be a lot of fun for families, especially children," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/peter-reisner-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Reisner, M.D.</a>, a family medicine physician at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/chetek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Chetek, Wisconsin</a>. "But parents should be aware of the hidden dangers they may not be thinking about when putting up the Christmas tree or heading out for an afternoon of sledding."</p>



<p>Dr. Reisner recommends these safety tips while preparing for the holidays:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Manage your Christmas tree.</strong></h2>



<p>If you have a real tree, ensure the tree stand is always filled with water so the tree doesn't dry out and pose an increased fire hazard. If you buy an artificial tree, make sure it is made from fire-retardant material. Make sure the stand is flat on the ground and decorate the tree to equally distribute weight.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Keep flames away.</strong></h2>



<p>Don't leave children alone in a room with lighted candles, matches, lighters, fireplaces, or any other sources of flame or heat.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Watch for tempting seasonal decor.</strong></h2>



<p>Keep decorations out of reach of children and secured to the wall. Any object small enough to fit through a toilet paper tube can obstruct a child's airway. Closely supervise children if they're helping you decorate, especially when handling lighting, ornaments and breakable objects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Keep plants out of little hands.</strong></h2>



<p>Keep mistletoe, holly berries and poinsettias out of reach of children, as each is toxic when ingested.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Remember electricity safety.</strong></h2>



<p>Use power strips with built-in circuit breakers. Avoid putting too many plugs into one electrical outlet. Keep cords out of the way or behind furniture, and insert electrical outlet covers into unused outlets. Purchase lights with the UL Listed mark, which certifies that the product has been tested to meet safety requirements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Find safe toys.</strong></h2>



<p>Make sure your children's toys are age-appropriate and the batteries cannot be easily removed. Batteries shaped like disks, or button batteries, pose a choking risk to young children. Avoid placing gifts under the tree that contain glass, perfume or cologne, poisonous substances or sharp materials.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Monitor alcohol in the home.</strong></h2>



<p>Keep alcohol out of reach of children. Quickly clean up leftover drinks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Bundle up and use safety gear.</strong></h2>



<p>Dress children properly for the weather, making sure that their hands, feet and heads are covered. Supervise children and make sure they wear the correct safety gear for sledding, skiing, snowboarding, ice skating and other outdoor activities.</p>



<p>"Carefully inspecting your home and taking care of any safety hazards can ensure you and your children have a happy and safe holiday season," says Dr. Reisner.</p>

<p>Whole grains are an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/whole-grains/art-20047826?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">important part of healthy diet</a>. They are good sources of complex carbohydrates, as well as some key vitamins and minerals. And because whole grains are naturally high in fiber, they may help you feel full and satisfied, which can make it easier to maintain a healthy body weight. Eating more whole-grain foods also can <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/expert-answers/whole-grain-foods/faq-20058417?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lower your blood pressure</a>.</p>



<p>Some people, though, have a medical diagnosis that means they must avoid the gluten in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celiac disease</a>, also called celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immune reaction to eating gluten. While the cause of celiac disease isn't known, theÂ <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-more-people-are-developing-celiac-disease/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disease is becoming more common</a>.</p>



<p>If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents it from absorbing some nutrients. The intestinal damage often causes diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating and anemia. And it can lead to serious complications.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/gluten-free-diet/art-20048530?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gluten-free diet</a> is essential to manage signs and symptoms of celiac disease and other medical conditions associated with gluten, including nonceliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wheat-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20378897?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wheat allergy</a>.</p>



<p>Following a gluten-free diet requires paying careful attention to food selections, the ingredients found in foods and their nutritional content, as well as medications.</p>



<p>Removing wheat, barley and rye from your diet may seem daunting. Trace amounts of gluten in your diet can be damaging, even if they don't cause signs or symptoms. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352225?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gluten can be hidden</a> in foods and nonfood products, including medications, vitamin and mineral supplements, toothpaste and mouthwash. A dietitian can help you plan a healthy, gluten-free diet. </p>



<p>And you can still enjoy the health benefits of eating whole grains. Options in a gluten-free diet include buckwheat, corn, flax, millet, quinoa and rice. While oats are naturally gluten-free, they may be contaminated during production with wheat, barley or rye. Oats and oat products labeled as gluten-free have not been cross-contaminated. However, some people with celiac disease cannot tolerate the oats labeled as gluten-free.</p>

<p>In 2017, Cindy Sutherland caught a nasty cold she couldn't shake. After coughing nonstop for weeks, she went to urgent care and got a chest X-ray. When the doctor shared the results with her, he asked, "Have you ever heard of pulmonary fibrosis?" Cindy started to cry because she knew what those words meant. Her grandmother had died of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary fibrosis</a> at the age of 62. Her mother had died of it at 58, and her sister at 48.</p>

<p>The progressive lung disease can be traced to a variety of causes â€” autoimmune conditions, radiation treatments, specific medications or chemotherapeutic agents, toxins like asbestos or coal dust and environmental factors like mold. Recently, researchers have begun to recognize that aÂ <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33935155/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subset of cases can be attributed to genetics</a>. Some patients with pulmonary fibrosis have shortened telomeres, the caps on the ends of chromosomes that protect cells from aging. Identifying these patients is critical because, in their case, certain treatments like immunosuppressive therapies could be dangerous.</p>

<p>"I think it is way more frequent than we realize," says Sutherlandâ€™s pulmonologist,Â <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/carmona-porquera-eva-m-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eva Carmona Porquera, M.D., Ph.D.</a>Â She is part of a large, multidisciplinary team at Mayo Clinic developing new ways to detect and treat pulmonary fibrosis cases caused by shortened telomeres.</p>



<p>"This is new territory," says Dr. Carmona Porquera. "The good thing is that at Mayo, we can offer genetic testing and telomere testing to our patients to classify, treat and prepare for complications associated with telomere biology disorders."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A rare and complex disorder</strong></h2>



<p>Telomere biology disorders are rare diseases caused by mutations that accelerate telomere shortening. Patients with these disorders are susceptible to a variety of age-related conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, bone marrow failure, osteoporosis, cancer and liver fibrosis. Many but not all patients show outward signs of premature aging, such as premature graying of hair or brittle nails.Â </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>HematologistÂ <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/patnaik-mrinal-s-m-b-b-s/bio-00093620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mrinal Patnaik, M.B.B.S</a>., first encountered these disorders as a medical resident in the early 2000s. A patient in his thirties with completely gray hair had shown up with a malignant tumor at the head and neck cancer clinic where Dr. Patnaik was training. Doctors there did not realize he had a telomere biology disorder. The patient died a month later from complete bone marrow failure.</p>



<p>"That really hurt me deep down," says Dr. Patnaik. "I felt that there's so many of these patients who are going to be coming into different clinics and if I didn't step up and set up a program for them and educate all my colleagues and set up the infrastructure, we're going to see a lot more patients suffer."&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the help of the Mayo ClinicÂ <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, Dr. Patnaik established the Telomere Biology Disorders Clinic at the Rochester, Minnesota, campus in 2017. The clinic is multidisciplinary in nature, drawing expertise from hematologists, oncologists, pulmonologists, liver specialists, pharmacists, molecular biologists and genetic counselors. To date, the clinic has seen more than 100 patients with shortened telomeres.</p>



<p>"We are among the largest adult telomere biology disorder clinics in the country," says Dr. Patnaik, who plans to open similar clinics in Arizona and Florida.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No perfect way</strong></h2>



<p>The most frequent manifestation of a telomere biology disorder is pulmonary fibrosis, the scarring of lung tissue that can make it difficult to breathe. As telomeres become shorter and shorter, the chromosomes they are designed to protect can unravel and fray, like a shoelace that has lost its protective cap. Eventually, the telomeres become so short that cells stop dividing â€” a process known as senescence. Those senescent cells send off a slew of chemicals that act as flares, triggering inflammatory changes that damage and thicken the lungs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers hope that by diagnosing and treating the disease earlier, they can improve outcomes for patients.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Ferrer_Alejandro-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379090" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Ferrer_Alejandro-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Ferrer_Alejandro.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Telomere biology disorders areÂ <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29976374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typically diagnosed</a>Â by looking for shortened telomeres and testing for genetic mutations. "There are different techniques that have been developed over time to measure telomere length, and each one has pros and cons," says molecular biologistÂ <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ferrer-alejandro-ph-d/bio-20503546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.</a>Â "Basically, there's no perfect way to do this."</p>



<p>One of the most common methods for measuring telomeres involves a technique known as Flow FISH, in which each telomere is labeled with a fluorescent marker and then fed into a machine that quantifies the average amount of fluorescence across all the telomeres on all the chromosomes in the cell. Other techniques involve sequencing to count the repetitive run of bases, TTAGGG, that makes up each telomere, again averaging the result.</p>



<p>"However, it's well-known in the field that it's not that all telomeres get shorter at the same time; it can be just one or two telomeres falling below a certain threshold that can cause disease," says Dr. Ferrer. "If you rely on a technique that uses the average, you could miss those cases."</p>



<p>Dr. Ferrer and collaborators within and outside Mayo Clinic devised a specialized sequencing technique called Telogator to assess the shortest telomere length of each chromosome.</p>



<p>"This test could have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value," says Dr. Patnaik.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Answers, finally</strong></h2>



<p>Even with the limitations of the current tests, the Telomere Biology Clinic is making aÂ <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=29804726&amp;query_hl=11&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive impact</a>Â on patients. Sutherland first visited the clinic in 2020 and learned that, on average, her telomere lengths fell below the first percentile. "Dr. Patnaik said they were the shortest telomeres he had ever seen," she recalls. Genetic testing revealed Sutherland had a mutation in the TERT gene, which codes for a protein called telomerase that is responsible for telomere maintenance.</p>



<p>The Mayo team estimates that they have identified aÂ <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33203829/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disease-causing variant in a telomere-associated gene</a>Â in only 40% of patients. In many cases, they have discovered genetic changes that may or may not cause disease â€” called variants of unknown significance â€” and have conducted functional studies in the laboratory to categorize the effect of those variants.</p>



<p>Sutherland says she felt relieved when she learned she had a genetic mutation. "You're always looking for a reason, a cause, an explanation for why this happened. Why did my grandmother, my mother and my sister pass of this horrible disease at such a young age?"</p>



<p>But that sense of relief was quickly replaced by one of foreboding for the mother of five. "I was absolutely, positively scared to death for my children."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Telomere biology disorders are subject to a troubling type of genetic inheritance known as genetic anticipation. The disorder tends to become more severe and appear at an earlier age as the mutation â€” and the shortened telomeres â€” are passed from one generation to the next. As a result, Sutherland worried not only that she had passed the condition on to her children, but also that they might inherit a form of the disease much worse than what she herself has experienced.</p>



<p>"These findings have repercussions for family members," says Dr. Carmona Porquera. "We can counsel patients: no smoking, no exposures that can cause more injury, be aware of certain symptoms. And we can start treating them earlier with anti-fibrotic drugs, which could slow the progression of the disease."</p>



<p>Sutherland has been taking anti-fibrotic drugs for the last six years. Though she often feels short of breath, at age 65, she still has the energy to babysit her grandchildren.</p>



<p>Recently, genetic testing revealed no inherited mutations in her family tree.</p>



<p>"Maybe this horrible disease will stop with me," she says. "That would be my greatest wish."</p>

<p>It's flu season again, so most people&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/dont-skip-your-flu-shot-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get a flu shot</a>&nbsp;and strive to stay healthy. But can certain foods or supplements boost the immune system and help with that "staying healthy" goal?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keep the immune system strong</h2>



<p>While having a healthy immune system is a plus during the season of colds and flu, consider these tips for keeping your immune system strong throughout the year.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on a balanced eating plan.</h4>



<p>Don't skip meals, so your body stays well-fueled. Aim for five to nine servings of vegetables and fruits daily to provide those immune-boosting vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. A serving of fruit is one medium piece of fresh fruit, 1 cup of berries or melon, or 1/2 cup of canned fruit packed in its own juice. A serving of vegetables is 1/2 cup cooked or 1 cup raw. Getting these nutrients from foods versus vitamin or mineral supplements is always best. Many herbal remedies are marketed to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/7-ways-to-combat-coughs-and-colds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fight colds</a>&nbsp;or shorten their duration, but check with a health care professional before taking any supplements or medications. And don't forget fluids. Remember to drink adequate fluids throughout the day. Plain water is best.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Crack down on spreading germs.</h4>



<p>Good hygiene and hand-washing help prevent the spread of germs. Remember to wash produce before eating or using it in recipes. Clean glasses, forks, spoons and other utensils to reduce the spread and growth of bacteria.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Increase sleep, reduce stress.</h4>



<p>Getting adequate sleep and managing stress can be just as important as healthy eating to prevent the flu.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Research demonstrates that lack of sleep and increased stress contribute to illness and overall poor health, so:</h5>



<ul>
<li>Adults should get seven to nine hours of sleep each day, while children need eight to 14 hours, depending on age.</li>



<li>Healthy ways to cope with stress include meditating, listening to music or journaling.</li>



<li>Physical activity is another strategy to manage stress and may reduce the risk of some chronic diseases that can weaken your immune system.</li>
</ul>



<p>Even if you eat healthily, get plenty of rest, drink adequate fluids and manage your stress, you may still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/facts-about-flu">catch the flu</a>. If so, your illness may not last as long, and you may not feel so bad.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some myths and facts about immune-boosting nutrients:</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fact: Chicken soup can help you feel better.</h3>



<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, there are many healing benefits of chicken soup. Your favorite recipe likely has properties that fight inflammation, promote hydration and get mucus flowing. Drink plenty of liquids, such as water, broth or sports drinks with electrolytes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Vitamin C can prevent illness.</h3>



<p>When taken before cold symptoms start, vitamin C may shorten the duration, but it doesn't keep you from getting sick.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Dairy increases mucus production.</h3>



<p>You may have heard that milk and other dairy products worsen congestion during an illness. Research has not proven this to be true.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choose immune-boosting nutrients</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">These nutrients play a role in immune health:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Beta carotene</strong><br>Beta carotene is found in plant foods, such as sweet potatoes, spinach, carrots, mangoes, broccoli and tomatoes.</li>



<li><strong>Vitamin C</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/add-citrus-colors-and-flavors-to-meals">Vitamin C-rich foods</a>&nbsp;include citrus fruits, berries, melons, tomatoes, bell peppers and broccoli.</li>



<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong><br>Vitamin D is found in fatty fish and eggs. Milk and 100% juices fortified with vitamin D also are good sources.</li>



<li><strong>Zinc</strong><br>Zinc tends to be better absorbed from foods such as beef and seafood, but it's also found in plant-based sources, including wheat germ, beans, nuts and tofu.</li>



<li><strong>Probiotics</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-deal-with-probiotics">Probiotics</a>&nbsp;are good bacteria that promote health. You'll find them in cultured dairy products, such as yogurt, and in fermented foods, such as kefir and kimchi.</li>



<li><strong>Protein</strong><br>Protein comes from animal and plant sources, including milk, yogurt, eggs, beef, chicken, seafood, nuts, seeds, beans and lentils.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stay well. In the meantime, here are some recipes incorporating immune-fighting foods:</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Chicken noodle soup with dill</h4>



<p>Serves 6</p>



<p>10 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth<br>3 medium carrots, diced<br>1 large stalk celery, diced<br>3 tablespoons minced fresh ginger<br>6 cloves garlic, minced<br>4 ounces whole-wheat egg noodles (3 cups)<br>4 cups shredded cooked skinless chicken breast (about 1 pound)<br>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill<br>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>I've been hearing a lot about mindfulness meditation lately and how it can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. But I'm a bit skeptical and don't really understand how sitting still and doing nothing can make such a big difference. I have a busy and active lifestyle, and the idea of spending time just focusing on my breath or thoughts sounds boring. Are there real benefits of mindfulness meditation and how it can realistically fit into a fast-paced life like mine?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: It's common to feel skeptical about an activity that promises quick and easy stress relief. Yet, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/use-mindfulness-to-improve-well-being?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">mindfulness</a> meditation promises just that. It's a fast and easy way to reduce stress wherever you are.</p>



<p>Mindfulness meditation is the practice of purposefully being aware of and focusing your attention on the present moment. Mindfulness allows you to be in tune with your experience â€” right now in this moment â€” and to explore with curiosity whatever sensations, thoughts and emotions are present without expectations or judgment.</p>



<p>During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This focus can result in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.</p>



<p>Many people may think of mindfulness <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/about/pac-20385120?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">meditation</a> as "sitting on a pillow, being still, with eyes closed." This may work for some, but there are many ways to practice mindfulness meditation.</p>



<p>Practicing mindfulness involves using breathing methods, guided imagery, and other strategies to relax the body and mind to help reduce stress.</p>



<p>To try focused breathing meditation, sit down, take a deep breath and close your eyes. Focus on your breath as it moves in and out of your body. Sitting and breathing slowly for even just a minute can help.</p>



<p>As you start meditating, try these structured mindfulness exercises:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Body scan meditation</strong><br>Lie on your back with your legs extended and arms at your sides, palms facing up. Focus your attention slowly and deliberately on each part of your body, in order, from toe to head or head to toe. Be aware of any sensations, emotions or thoughts associated with each part of your body.</li>



<li><strong>Sitting meditation</strong><br>Sit comfortably with your back straight, feet flat on the floor and hands in your lap. Breathing through your nose, focus on your breath moving in and out of your body. If physical sensations or thoughts interrupt your meditation, note the experience and then return your focus to your breathing.</li>



<li><strong>Walking meditation</strong><br>Find a quiet place 10- to 20-feet long and walk slowly. Focus on the experience of walking, being aware of the sensations of standing and the subtle movements that keep your balance. When you reach the end of your path, turn and continue walking, maintaining awareness of your sensations.</li>
</ul>



<p>Often, mindfulness meditation is recommended as part of a comprehensive treatment for physical and mental health conditions. It's considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. You can incorporate mindfulness meditation into your busy routine to improve your overall health.</p>



<p>There are many benefits of mindfulness meditation engaging the brain. Think of it as a form of brain exercise. Just as physical exercise keeps your body healthy, mindfulness meditation keeps your <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-tips-to-keep-your-brain-healthy?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">brain fit</a>. Research has shown that just five to 15 minutes of daily meditation is all you need to begin experiencing benefits.</p>



<p>After decades of research into the practice, these benefits have been found to include an increase in:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cognitive flexibility</li>



<li>Diabetes control</li>



<li>Emotion regulation</li>



<li>Empathy</li>



<li>Focus and attention</li>



<li>Immune system response</li>



<li>Memory</li>



<li>Positive emotions</li>



<li>Positive relationships</li>



<li>Relaxation</li>



<li>Self-compassion</li>



<li>Self-esteem</li>
</ul>



<p>The practice also affects many negative physical and mental symptoms, including decreases in:</p>



<ul>
<li>Addictive behaviors</li>



<li>Anger and hostility</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20360803?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Anxiety</a></li>

<li>Emotional reactivity</li>

<li>High blood pressure</li>



<li>Need for pain medications</li>



<li>Physical pain</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/unraveling-the-mysteries-of-ptsd">Post-traumatic stress disorder</a> symptoms</li>



<li>Stress</li>
</ul>



<p>Mindfulness is a supportive strategy to help manage many health issues. It pairs well with other medical treatments and counseling. It's a simple strategy that doesn't require a prescription or special equipment and can be practiced anywhere. Talk with your healthcare team about incorporating mindfulness meditation into your life and see if it makes a difference in your health and general sense of well-being. â€” <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/joel-bobby-licsw"><em>Joel Bobby</em></a></strong><strong><em>, licensed independent clinical social worker, Psychiatry &amp; Psychology, Mayo Clinic Health System,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/austin"><em>Austin, Minnesota</em></a></strong></p>

<p>Most people expect the holidays to be a happy, jolly time. But that doesn't match reality for everyone.</p>



<p>"Maybe your relatives aren't showing up for dinner. Or you are estranged from a family member. Or there are financial concerns," says Fuehrer. "And it's not fitting with the way the holidays are supposed to be."</p>



<p>She says people are bombarded by the media during the holidays with expectations of having the next best thing. And that can make you feel depressed because nothing is good enough.</p>



<p>"At that point, it's time to switch to gratefulness and connections with other people," says Fuehrer.</p>



<p>For example, take time every day to share a treasure with someone.</p>



<p>"The treasure could be a funny story, a kind story, something new you've learned or something beautiful in nature," says Fuehrer.</p>



<p>And try lowering your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20360803?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a> by being <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/mindfulness-exercises/art-20046356?_ga=2.224555161.2019416853.1544722212-991613608.1525112040?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mindful</a>.</p>



<p>"[Pay] attention to your senses," she says. "What do you hear, smell, see, taste and touch?"</p>



<p>And pay it forward with random acts of kindness. It will brighten your day and someone else's too.</p>

<p>National Handwashing Awareness Week will be observed Dec. 3â€“9, so this is a good time for a reminder that washing your hands&nbsp;is one of the best ways to avoid getting sick and spreading illness. </p>



<p>Keeping hands clean can prevent 1 in 3 diarrhea-related illnesses and 1 in 5 respiratory infections, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/handwashing-family.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/hand-washing/art-20046253?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hand-washing</a> is an easy way to prevent infection. As you touch people, surfaces and objects throughout the day, you accumulate germs on your hands. You can infect yourself with these germs by touching your eyes, nose or mouth, or spread them to others. Although it's impossible to keep your hands germ-free, washing your hands with soap and water frequently can help limit the transfer of bacteria, viruses and other microbes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/respiratory-syncytial-virus/symptoms-causes/syc-20353098?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Respiratory syncytial virus</a> (RSV) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a> (flu) are respiratory infections caused by different viruses.

All three of these conditions can cause severe illness in people at higher risk, including young children under 2, adults over 65, and those who have weakened immune systems and chronic illnesses. Frequent hand-washing can prevent the spread of diarrhea, RSV and the flu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>How to wash your hands</strong></h2>



<p>It's generally best to wash your hands with soap and water. Over-the-counter antibacterial soaps are no more effective at killing germs than is regular soap.</p>



<p>Follow these steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wet your hands with clean, running water â€” either warm or cold.</li>



<li>Apply soap and lather well.</li>



<li>Rub your hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Remember to scrub all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, wrists, between your fingers and under your fingernails.</li>



<li>Rinse well.</li>



<li>Dry your hands with a clean towel or air-dry them.</li>
</ul>



<p>Young children learn by imitation, so be sure you are following good hand hygiene practices at home. Wash your hands with your children to show them how it's done. And if you need a refresher,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/poland-gregory-a-m-d/bio-00078220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gregory Poland</a>,<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>an infectious diseases expert and head of Mayo Clinicâ€™s Vaccine Research Group, offers a&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-proper-way-to-wash-your-hands/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonstration on hand-washing</a>.</p>

<p>Approximately 250 million people worldwide carry the gene for sickle cell disease. It affects those with roots in Africa, Spanish-speaking regions in the Western Hemisphere, Saudi Arabia, India and Mediterranean countries. In the U.S., sickle cell disease is most common in the African American community.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Genetics</h3>



<p>"Sickle cell disease is a genetic, inherited disorder. It's caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for hemoglobin," says Dr. Ferdjallah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a baby to be born with the disease, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene.</p>



<p>The normally flexible red blood cells turn into rigid crescent shapes â€” sickle cellsâ€” that get stuck in blood vessels. And that can cause problems down the line.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Screening </h3>



<p>"Fortunately, in the United States, every baby, as part of their newborn screen, is screened for sickle cell disease," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>



<p>Babies may not show symptoms until 5 or 6 months, with pain or swelling in the fingertips. And then, later in life,&nbsp;Dr. Ferdjallah says patients experience, "Pain in the extremities, in the back. It's all caused by those sickle cells being stuck in the blood vessels."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risks</h3>



<p>Along with pain, the risks for heart and kidney damage and stroke are increased.</p>



<p>"Some of our patients actually experienced stroke, or what we call silent strokes, from the sickle cells actually getting stuck and creating a blockage in the cerebral vessels," Dr. Ferdjallah says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That's why it's important to work with patients early on and regularly.</p>



<p>"The earlier you go to curative therapy, the better," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>
