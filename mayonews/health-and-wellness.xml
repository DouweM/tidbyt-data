<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>I've been hearing a lot about mindfulness meditation lately and how it can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being. But I'm a bit skeptical and don't really understand how sitting still and doing nothing can make such a big difference. I have a busy and active lifestyle, and the idea of spending time just focusing on my breath or thoughts sounds boring. Are there real benefits of mindfulness meditation and how it can realistically fit into a fast-paced life like mine?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: It's common to feel skeptical about an activity that promises quick and easy stress relief. Yet, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/use-mindfulness-to-improve-well-being?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">mindfulness</a> meditation promises just that. It's a fast and easy way to reduce stress wherever you are.</p>



<p>Mindfulness meditation is the practice of purposefully being aware of and focusing your attention on the present moment. Mindfulness allows you to be in tune with your experience — right now in this moment — and to explore with curiosity whatever sensations, thoughts and emotions are present without expectations or judgment.</p>



<p>During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This focus can result in enhanced physical and emotional well-being.</p>



<p>Many people may think of mindfulness <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/about/pac-20385120?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">meditation</a> as "sitting on a pillow, being still, with eyes closed." This may work for some, but there are many ways to practice mindfulness meditation.</p>



<p>Practicing mindfulness involves using breathing methods, guided imagery, and other strategies to relax the body and mind to help reduce stress.</p>



<p>To try focused breathing meditation, sit down, take a deep breath and close your eyes. Focus on your breath as it moves in and out of your body. Sitting and breathing slowly for even just a minute can help.</p>



<p>As you start meditating, try these structured mindfulness exercises:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Body scan meditation</strong><br>Lie on your back with your legs extended and arms at your sides, palms facing up. Focus your attention slowly and deliberately on each part of your body, in order, from toe to head or head to toe. Be aware of any sensations, emotions or thoughts associated with each part of your body.</li>



<li><strong>Sitting meditation</strong><br>Sit comfortably with your back straight, feet flat on the floor and hands in your lap. Breathing through your nose, focus on your breath moving in and out of your body. If physical sensations or thoughts interrupt your meditation, note the experience and then return your focus to your breathing.</li>



<li><strong>Walking meditation</strong><br>Find a quiet place 10- to 20-feet long and walk slowly. Focus on the experience of walking, being aware of the sensations of standing and the subtle movements that keep your balance. When you reach the end of your path, turn and continue walking, maintaining awareness of your sensations.</li>
</ul>



<p>Often, mindfulness meditation is recommended as part of a comprehensive treatment for physical and mental health conditions. It's considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. You can incorporate mindfulness meditation into your busy routine to improve your overall health.</p>



<p>There are many benefits of mindfulness meditation engaging the brain. Think of it as a form of brain exercise. Just as physical exercise keeps your body healthy, mindfulness meditation keeps your <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-tips-to-keep-your-brain-healthy?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">brain fit</a>. Research has shown that just five to 15 minutes of daily meditation is all you need to begin experiencing benefits.</p>



<p>After decades of research into the practice, these benefits have been found to include an increase in:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cognitive flexibility</li>



<li>Diabetes control</li>



<li>Emotion regulation</li>



<li>Empathy</li>



<li>Focus and attention</li>



<li>Immune system response</li>



<li>Memory</li>



<li>Positive emotions</li>



<li>Positive relationships</li>



<li>Relaxation</li>



<li>Self-compassion</li>



<li>Self-esteem</li>
</ul>



<p>The practice also affects many negative physical and mental symptoms, including decreases in:</p>



<ul>
<li>Addictive behaviors</li>



<li>Anger and hostility</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20360803?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Anxiety</a></li>

<li>Emotional reactivity</li>

<li>High blood pressure</li>



<li>Need for pain medications</li>



<li>Physical pain</li>

<li>Stress</li>
</ul>



<p>Mindfulness is a supportive strategy to help manage many health issues. It pairs well with other medical treatments and counseling. It's a simple strategy that doesn't require a prescription or special equipment and can be practiced anywhere. Talk with your healthcare team about incorporating mindfulness meditation into your life and see if it makes a difference in your health and general sense of well-being. — <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/joel-bobby-licsw"><em>Joel Bobby</em></a></strong><strong><em>, licensed independent clinical social worker, Psychiatry &amp; Psychology, Mayo Clinic Health System,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/austin"><em>Austin, Minnesota</em></a></strong></p>

<p>Most people expect the holidays to be a happy, jolly time. But that doesn't match reality for everyone.</p>



<p>"Maybe your relatives aren't showing up for dinner. Or you are estranged from a family member. Or there are financial concerns," says Fuehrer. "And it's not fitting with the way the holidays are supposed to be."</p>



<p>She says people are bombarded by the media during the holidays with expectations of having the next best thing. And that can make you feel depressed because nothing is good enough.</p>



<p>"At that point, it's time to switch to gratefulness and connections with other people," says Fuehrer.</p>



<p>For example, take time every day to share a treasure with someone.</p>



<p>"The treasure could be a funny story, a kind story, something new you've learned or something beautiful in nature," says Fuehrer.</p>



<p>And try lowering your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20360803?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a> by being <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/mindfulness-exercises/art-20046356?_ga=2.224555161.2019416853.1544722212-991613608.1525112040?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mindful</a>.</p>



<p>"[Pay] attention to your senses," she says. "What do you hear, smell, see, taste and touch?"</p>



<p>And pay it forward with random acts of kindness. It will brighten your day and someone else's too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>How to wash your hands</strong></h2>



<p>It's generally best to wash your hands with soap and water. Over-the-counter antibacterial soaps are no more effective at killing germs than is regular soap.</p>



<p>Follow these steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wet your hands with clean, running water — either warm or cold.</li>



<li>Apply soap and lather well.</li>



<li>Rub your hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Remember to scrub all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, wrists, between your fingers and under your fingernails.</li>



<li>Rinse well.</li>



<li>Dry your hands with a clean towel or air-dry them.</li>
</ul>



<p>Young children learn by imitation, so be sure you are following good hand hygiene practices at home. Wash your hands with your children to show them how it's done. And if you need a refresher,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/poland-gregory-a-m-d/bio-00078220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gregory Poland</a>,<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>an infectious diseases expert and head of Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group, offers a&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-proper-way-to-wash-your-hands/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonstration on hand-washing</a>.</p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide by Dec. 8 on a&nbsp;new therapy to treat sickle cell disease using gene editing technology called&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2018/07/24/the-gene-editing-tool-crispr-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CRISPR</a>, which stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.</p>



<p>Approximately 250 million people worldwide carry the gene for sickle cell disease. It affects those with roots in Africa, Spanish-speaking regions in the Western Hemisphere, Saudi Arabia, India and Mediterranean countries. In the U.S., sickle cell disease is most common in the African American community.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Genetics</h3>



<p>"Sickle cell disease is a genetic, inherited disorder. It's caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for hemoglobin," says Dr. Ferdjallah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a baby to be born with the disease, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene.</p>



<p>The normally flexible red blood cells turn into rigid crescent shapes — sickle cells— that get stuck in blood vessels. And that can cause problems down the line.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Screening </h3>



<p>"Fortunately, in the United States, every baby, as part of their newborn screen, is screened for sickle cell disease," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>



<p>Babies may not show symptoms until 5 or 6 months, with pain or swelling in the fingertips. And then, later in life,&nbsp;Dr. Ferdjallah says patients experience, "Pain in the extremities, in the back. It's all caused by those sickle cells being stuck in the blood vessels."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risks</h3>



<p>Along with pain, the risks for heart and kidney damage and stroke are increased.</p>



<p>"Some of our patients actually experienced stroke, or what we call silent strokes, from the sickle cells actually getting stuck and creating a blockage in the cerebral vessels," Dr. Ferdjallah says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That's why it's important to work with patients early on and regularly.</p>



<p>"The earlier you go to curative therapy, the better," says Dr. Ferdjallah.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>My elderly mom has recently been told she needs to take a bunch of different medications every day due to her health conditions. It's gotten pretty overwhelming, and I'm worried about things like her missing doses or drug interactions. I just want to make sure she's safe and healthy. Do you have tips on how to handle my mom's meds?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Some older people struggle with remembering to take their medications or organizing them effectively. Adult children, like yourself, can help by taking steps to monitor and update medication lists. Doing this can help prevent potential health complications, while also providing peace of mind for both you and your mom.</p>



<p>The most common medication-related problems in older adults include taking too high or too low of a dose, taking unnecessary medications, not taking medication as directed or at all, taking an ineffective medication, or adverse drug reactions such as confusion, bleeding and oversedation.</p>



<p>In addition, certain medications require special monitoring. Medications used to control pain, anxiety, mood and sleep pose the largest risk for patients as they age. Medications for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/multimedia/vid-20538081?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> also can be problematic if they are not monitored closely and adjusted as health conditions change. </p>



<p>Every person's medication needs are different. The risk for medication-related problems increases with each medication that is added. If your mom takes four or more medications, she has a higher risk for medication-related problems especially falls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are six tips for helping your mom with her medications:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gather information about the medications she uses. </strong><br>Get your mother's up-to-date medication lists from her healthcare team. Make sure that this list matches the prescription containers in her home. Then talk through each medication so both of you fully understand what it is taken for, how often and at what dose.</li>



<li><strong>Contact the pharmacy about available medication management services.</strong> <br>Many pharmacies offer individual dose, or compliance packaging, options. This is a low-cost way to help patients better manage daily medications and it offers a way for family members to double-check on doses that may have been missed. If your pharmacy doesn't offer this service, use a medication planner. This is a plastic organizer that stores scheduled doses of medications and makes it easier to keep on top of which medication to take and when.</li>



<li><strong>Contact the pharmacy about medication synchronization.</strong> <br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/medication-synchronization-increases-prescription-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medication synchronization</a> allows patients to fill most medications at one time every 30 or 90 days, instead of refill cycles scattered throughout the month. This may help simplify and organize medications.</li>



<li><strong>Request access to your mother's medical records. <br></strong>If something goes wrong and your mom needs extra help, having digital access to her <a href="https://onlineservices.mayoclinic.org/content/staticpatient/showpage/patientonline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical records</a> can help you get in touch with her primary care clinician or pharmacist to assist.</li>



<li><strong>Schedule a visit with a pharmacist.</strong> <br>A comprehensive medication review can be scheduled through your mother's primary care clinician's office. You can ask for a referral during a visit or call the scheduling line and ask for a referral. During the visit, a clinical pharmacist will review your parent's medication lists to ensure all the medications are prescribed correctly.</li>



<li><strong>Talk with a pharmacist before adding vitamins and supplements.</strong> <br>Even though these products can be purchased over the counter without a prescription, there are still important interaction concerns with some medications. Talk with a healthcare professional or pharmacist before adding vitamins, herbal remedies or supplements to your mom's medication regimen.</li>
</ul>



<p>As a caregiver, it's important that you take time for self-care and recharging so that you can continue to give. Pay attention to how you feel emotionally and physically. If you need a break or would like assistance, ask family members or other loved ones for help. There are many caregiving resources in the community that can help your mom with needed services or additional support. The best measure of caregiver success is if you did your best with what you had available at that moment. Remember, you don't have to do it alone. <em>— <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/catherine-lea-rph-bcacp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Catherine Lea</strong></a><strong>, Registered Pharmacist, Medication Therapy Management, Mayo Clinic Health System, </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire"><strong>Eau Claire, Wisconsin</strong></a></em></p>

Depending on the symptoms, causes of earache in children include a foreign object in the ear, the common cold, swimmer's ear and earwax blockage. Another common cause of ear pain in children is an ear infection, or otitis media. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>"My ear hurts." There are many conditions that can trigger this complaint from a young child.

<p>Another common cause of ear pain in children is an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20351616?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ear infection</a>, or otitis media. It's an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/multimedia/img-20515992?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infection of the middle ear</a>, the air-filled space behind the eardrum that contains the tiny vibrating bones of the ear. Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections.</p>



<p>An ear infection is caused by a bacterium or virus in the middle ear. This infection often results from another illness — cold, flu or allergy — that causes congestion and swelling of the nasal passages, throat and eustachian tubes, which are narrow tubes that run from the middle ear to high in the back of the throat.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>The onset of signs and symptoms of ear infection is usually rapid.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms common in children include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ear pain, especially when lying down.</li>



<li>Tugging or pulling at an ear.</li>



<li>Trouble sleeping.</li>



<li>Crying more than usual.</li>



<li>Fussiness.</li>



<li>Trouble hearing or responding to sounds.</li>



<li>Loss of balance.</li>



<li>Fever of 100 F or higher.</li>



<li>Drainage of fluid from the ear.</li>



<li>Headache.</li>



<li>Loss of appetite.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2>



<p>Risk factors for ear infections include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Age.</strong><br>Children between 6 months and 2 years are more susceptible to ear infections because of the size and shape of their eustachian tubes and because their immune systems are still developing.</li>



<li><strong>Group child care.</strong><br>Children cared for in group settings are more likely to get colds and ear infections than children who stay home. The children in group settings are exposed to more infections, such as the common cold.</li>



<li><strong>Infant feeding.</strong><br>Babies who drink from a bottle, especially while lying down, tend to have more ear infections than do babies who are breastfed.</li>



<li><strong>Seasonal factors.</strong><br>Ear infections are most common during the fall and winter. Children with seasonal allergies may have a greater risk of ear infections when pollen counts are high.</li>



<li><strong>Poor air quality.</strong><br>Exposure to tobacco smoke or high levels of air pollution can increase the risk of ear infections.</li>



<li><strong>Alaska Native heritage.</strong><br>Ear infections are more common among Alaska Natives.</li>



<li><strong>Cleft palate.</strong><br>Differences in the bone structure and muscles in children who have cleft palates may make it more difficult for the eustachian tube to drain.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Because ear infections often clear up on their own, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351622?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> may begin with managing pain and monitoring the problem. Sometimes, antibiotics are used to clear the infection. What's best for your child depends on many factors, including your child's age and the severity of symptoms.</p>



<p>Your child's healthcare team may recommend:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>A wait-and-see approach.</strong><br>The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend a wait-and-see approach as one option for:
<ul>
<li>Children 6 to 23 months with mild middle ear pain in one ear for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F.</li>



<li>Children 24 months and older with mild middle ear pain in one or both ears for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Managing pain.</strong><br>Your child's healthcare professional will advise you on treatments to lessen pain from an ear infection. These may include over-the-counter pain medications or anesthetic drops.</li>



<li><strong>Antibiotic therapy.</strong><br>Some evidence suggests that treatment with antibiotics might be helpful for certain children with ear infections. On the other hand, using antibiotics too often can cause bacteria to become resistant to the medicine. Talk with your child's healthcare professional about the potential benefits and risks of using antibiotics. After an initial observation period, your child's healthcare professional may recommend antibiotic treatment for an ear infection in the following situations:
<ul>
<li>Children 6 months and older with moderate to severe ear pain in one or both ears for at least 48 hours or a temperature of 102.2 F.</li>



<li>Children 6 to 23 months with mild middle ear pain in one or both ears for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F.</li>



<li>Children 24 months and older with mild middle ear pain in one or both ears for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Ear tubes.</strong><br>If your child has repeated, long-term ear infections (chronic otitis media) or continuous fluid buildup in the ear after an infection cleared up (otitis media with effusion), your child's healthcare professional may recommend <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ear-tubes/about/pac-20384667?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ear tubes</a> to drain fluid from the middle ear.</li>



<li><strong>Treatment for chronic suppurative otitis media.</strong><br>Chronic infection that results in a hole or tear in the eardrum — called chronic suppurative otitis media — is difficult to treat. It's often treated with antibiotics administered as drops. You may receive instructions on how to suction fluids out through the ear canal before administering drops.</li>



<li><strong>Monitoring.</strong><br>Children who have frequent infections or who have persistent fluid in the middle ear will need to be monitored closely. Talk to your child's healthcare professional about how often you should schedule follow-up appointments. They may recommend regular hearing and language tests.</li>

<p>Winter means the days are shorter and you spend more time indoors where it's warm. But with a lack of sun exposure, are you getting enough vitamin D?</p>



<p>"It comes from the sun in the form of UV light in which your body uses that UV light to help to synthesize, or make, vitamin D," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>But, he says, the sun isn't the only source of vitamin D.</p>



<p>"There are many foods that have vitamin D. Foods also are fortified with it, such as cereals, orange juices and milk have vitamin D. If you get enough from your sources, such as even eating fish such as tuna or salmon, that's an adequate source," says Dr. Bracamonte. "In cases where you don't think you're getting enough, a low-dose vitamin D supplement may be beneficial to help the bone health, help your musculoskeletal health and maybe stave off some additional diseases. Low-dose vitamin D is usually in the general multivitamin. That typically suffices."</p>



<p>He says he recommends taking the supplement in the morning with food.&nbsp;And if you're concerned that you're not getting enough vitamin D, ask your clinician for a simple blood test to check your vitamin D levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Regular <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urine-color/symptoms-causes/syc-20367333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urine color</a> varies but usually ranges from clear to pale yellow. The exact hue depends on how much water you drink. Fluids dilute the yellow pigments in urine. So the more you drink, the clearer your urine looks. When you drink less, the yellow color becomes stronger.</p>



<p>Some foods and medications can change the color of urine. For example, foods like beets, blackberries and fava beans can turn urine pink or red. Some medications also can give urine vivid tones, such as orange or greenish-blue.</p>



<p>An unusual urine color also can be a sign of a health problem, however. For instance, some urinary tract infections can turn urine milky white. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidney stones</a>, some <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancers</a> and other diseases sometimes make urine look red due to blood.</p>



<p>Here are some unusual urine colors, along with things that can cause them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Red or pink urine</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Red urine isn't always a sign of a serious health problem. Red or pink urine can be caused by:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Blood</strong><br>Health problems that can cause blood in the urine include an enlarged prostate, tumors that aren't cancer, and kidney stones and cysts. Vigorous exercise also can cause blood in the urine. Blood in the urine is common in urinary tract infections and with kidney stones. Those problems often cause pain. Painless bleeding might be a sign of a more serious problem, such as cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Foods</strong><br>Beets, blackberries and rhubarb can turn urine red or pink.</li>



<li><strong>Medicines</strong><br>Red or pink urine is possible if you take medications for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tuberculosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tuberculosis</a>, urinary tract pain or constipation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Orange urine</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Orange urine can be caused by:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Medicines</strong><br>Constipation medicines can turn urine orange, as can medicine that lessens swelling and irritation, and some chemotherapy medicines for cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Vitamins</strong><br>Some vitamins, such as A and B-12, can turn urine orange or yellow-orange.</li>



<li><strong>Health problems</strong><br>Orange urine can be a sign of a problem with the liver or bile duct, mainly if you also have light-colored stools. Dehydration also can make your urine look orange.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blue or green urine</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Blue or green urine can be caused by:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dyes</strong><br>Some brightly colored food dyes can cause green urine. Dyes used for some kidney and bladder tests can turn urine blue.</li>



<li><strong>Medicines</strong><br>Some medicines for depression, ulcers and acid reflux can turn urine greenish-blue. Medications for pain, arthritis and sleep also can turn urine green.</li>



<li><strong>Health problems</strong><br>A rare disease called familial benign hypercalcemia can cause children to have blue urine. Urinary tract infections caused by a certain bacteria can cause green urine.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dark brown or cola-colored urine</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Brown urine can be caused by:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Foods</strong><br>Eating lots of fava beans, rhubarb or aloe can cause dark brown urine.</li>



<li><strong>Medicines</strong><br>Some medicines can darken urine, including those used to treat and prevent malaria, constipation, high cholesterol and seizures. Some antibiotics and muscle relaxers also can darken urine.</li>



<li><strong>Health problems</strong><br>Some liver and kidney disorders and urinary tract infections can turn urine dark brown. So can bleeding inside the body, called a hemorrhage. A group of illnesses mainly affecting the skin or the nervous system, called porphyria, also can cause brown urine.</li>



<li><strong>Extreme exercise</strong><br>A muscle injury from extreme training can cause tea- or cola-colored urine. The injury can lead to kidney damage.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cloudy or murky urine</h2>



<p>Urinary tract infections and kidney stones can cause urine to look cloudy or murky.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that colors can look slightly different to different people. For instance, what looks red to you might look orange to someone else. Talk with your healthcare team if you have concerns and in particular if you have painful urination or dark orange urine, which can be a sign that your liver isn't working correctly.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My neighbor recently retired, and I've been trying to convince her to volunteer at the library with me. She's not swayed by my stories of feeling good from helping others. Can you share some other benefits of dedicating her time and energy to a cause?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Thank you for volunteering in your community and for trying to persuade your neighbor to join you. Volunteers make an immeasurable difference in people's lives.</p>



<p>The act of volunteering also benefits a person's health as well. Research has shown that volunteering offers significant health benefits, especially for older adults. Here are the top three you can share with your neighbor:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Improves physical and mental health.</strong></h2>



<p>Volunteer activities keep people moving and thinking at the same time. Research has found that volunteering among adults who are 60 and older provided benefits to physical and mental health. Volunteers report better physical health than nonvolunteers. Volunteering leads to lower rates of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20360803?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a>, especially for people 65 and older.</p>



<p>It reduces stress and increases positive, relaxed feelings by releasing dopamine in the brain. By spending time in service to others, volunteers report feeling a sense of meaning and appreciation, both given and received, which can have a stress-reducing effect.</p>



<p>Reduced stress further decreases the risk of some physical and mental health problems, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>, depression, anxiety and general illness. In addition, people who volunteer have lower mortality rates than those who do not, even when controlling for age, sex and physical health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Provides a sense of purpose and teaches valuable skills.</strong></h2>



<p>The work that volunteers provide is essential to everyday activities, giving volunteers a sense of purpose, especially when giving their time and talents in the areas they find meaningful. Older volunteers experience greater increases in life satisfaction and self-esteem.</p>



<p>In addition to volunteering at libraries, schools and food pantries, many people volunteer at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/volunteers?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local hospitals</a>. They serve as greeters and waiting room attendants, provide patient room information and directions, and help transport patients and patient items.</p>



<p>Other volunteers use their craft skills to make prayer shawls, blankets, sweaters and hats that are typically given to newborn babies and patients with cancer. Other services volunteers provide include working in the hospital gift shop, performing clerical duties for staff or offering pet therapy to patients.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Nurture new and existing relationships.</strong></h2>



<p>Volunteering increases social interaction and helps build a support system based on common interests. One of the best ways to make new friends and strengthen existing relationships is to participate in a shared activity. Social circles can shrink in retirement so building or expanding networks can be especially important during this phase of your neighbor's life.</p>



<p>In many cases, volunteers have diverse backgrounds, which helps expand their social network and allows them to practice social skills with others.</p>



<p>As you may have found from your own experience, people are motivated to volunteer for several reasons. They may be exploring careers, sharpening skills, meeting new people, serving their communities or staying active during retirement. Yet all volunteers share a common desire to improve the health and welfare of people in their communities.</p>



<p>The good news is that your neighbor doesn't need to be a philanthropist or senator to enhance or create change in the community. Offer other suggestions if she's not interested in volunteering at the library. Likely, there are a wide variety of volunteer opportunities in your community, whether she's interested in youth, environmental, health, religious or community causes. Encourage her to connect with local nonprofit and cultural organizations, schools, faith communities or hospitals for options.</p>



<p>As you have discovered, volunteering makes an immeasurable difference in people's lives. If your neighbor is open to it, her time and talents can help others and benefit her health at the same time. — <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/angela-thoreson-licsw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Angela Thoreson</em></a><em>, licensed independent clinical social worker, Psychiatry &amp; Psychology, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/austin"><em>Austin, Minnesota</em></a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:00) is in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/SCRIPT-MCM-3-tips-from-Mayo-Clinic-dietitian-about-holiday-indulgence17.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>However you celebrate the holidays, there is likely to be an excess of food at your fingertips. And that usually means lots of sugar and perhaps alcohol.</p>



<p>Delgado says you can manage indulgences during the holidays with these three tips.</p>



<p>"No. 1: Don't choose to go on a diet right before the holidays," she says.</p>



<p>Instead, pay attention to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how much</a>&nbsp;and how often you're eating.</p>



<p>"No. 2: Don't beat yourself up. If you do overindulge, it's OK to make a plan moving forward at the next party, at the next gathering," says Delgado.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Allow yourself to choose different items and portion sizes next time. What you drink matters too.</p>

<p>"No. 3: Stay hydrated. Oftentimes what we neglect most is staying hydrated, and we choose sugary beverages or alcohol, which can add a lot of added calories, empty calories that we can save by drinking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water</a>," she says.</p>



<p>Water should be your main beverage every day, including the holidays</p>
