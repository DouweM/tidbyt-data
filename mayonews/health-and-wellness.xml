<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I worry about my neighbors this time of year who live alone. Are there health risks to loneliness? What can be done to help?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Up to 40% of older adults feel lonely. Loneliness can occur in all age groups, but people over the age of 60 have been shown to have higher incidences of both loneliness and social isolation. Loneliness is a feeling, while social isolation is something that can be measured. For example, how often do you talk to someone? How often do you leave the house? Do you attend religious services or other community events? Some people can be surrounded by a crowd but still feel lonely because they're not experiencing good connections. Social isolation measures how often you interact with other people and genuinely connect.</p>



<p>Health risks associated with loneliness can include depression, anxiety, increased risks of suicide, premature death, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dementia</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strokes</a>, heart attacks and other chronic health risks. The health risks of a lack of social connection can be just as high as the health risks of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>, smoking, physical inactivity or excessive alcohol consumption. If we pay attention to those other areas of our health, we should pay attention to social connectedness. High blood pressure, stroke and heart attack risk increase as we age. If you combine that risk with someone who is also lonely, that can increase the health risk.  </p>



<p>If someone falls who is socially isolated, the risk of complications from a potential hip fracture increases because no one may be checking in on them. If patients are admitted to the hospital for a heart attack and score high on loneliness, they are more likely to get readmitted to the hospital. If you need a colonoscopy but don't have someone to drive you, you might not get your needed procedure done. Health systems recognize these healthcare impacts and now routinely ask patients about their social connections. The U.K. and Japanese governments have recognized the public health impacts and have established ministerial leads addressing loneliness, including a "Campaign to End Loneliness" in the U.K.</p>



<p>There are many things that you can do to address loneliness and social isolation. One of the best is addressing sensory deprivation, specifically hearing and vision. When someone has hearing loss, it becomes challenging (even with hearing aids) to go to a party or a crowded restaurant. The person withdraws because they can't understand what's happening around them. Things that can help this are getting your hearing checked, ensuring you have a suitable hearing aid and learning how to use it properly. These little "computers for your ears" can make interacting with people in a social setting easier.</p>



<p>Taking the first steps may be intimidating, but someone else's assistance could help get you there. Social workers can be a great resource for connecting people to social resources. People may find support from a faith community or hobby groups. You find like-minded people when you do things you are passionate about or interested in. Many people benefit from intergenerational activities such as volunteering in schools and reading to children at the library. Social media and online resources can be another way to discover these opportunities.</p>



<p>While social media is a tool that can be used to connect to people of similar interests, there is still a need for direct human interaction. Physical touch, such as a handshake or a hug, is vital from infancy onward. The holidays can be an intensified time for people to be aware of their loneliness. Maybe you saw someone throwing a holiday party, but you were home alone. Loneliness may spike during the holidays because of what is seen in the media, through our own expectations or loss of family connection.</p>



<p>When we feel lonely, we may feel like people should come to us and fill our cups, but sometimes it's up to us to put ourselves out there. Even if you take a moment to make a small interaction at the grocery store, it may make your world seem a little less lonely. If we can start giving some energy to the universe, the universe will give it back to us and help us all feel more connected to each other. <em>— <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shah-amit-a-m-d/bio-20113894?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Amit Shah</a></strong></em><strong><em>, Geriatrician, Internist, Palliative Care Specialist, Mayo Clinic in Arizona</em></strong></p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. – The holidays have come and gone once again, and many of us are starting to think about just how much we indulged this season.</p>



<p>"When it came to eating, how did this past holiday season treat you? Which healthy habits did you maintain and which ones did you neglect?" asks <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/-/media/shared-files/images/medical-professionals/full/mankato/lisa-hardesty-phdlp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Hardesty,</a> Ph.D., a clinical health psychologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato</a>. "It is easy to feel like a failure in relationship to maintaining our healthy focus, but consistency and allowing yourself grace are important concepts to remember over the holiday time."</p>



<p>Shame, guilt and disappointment are several feelings that can lead people to kick-start strict diets beginning Jan. 1. But drastic overnight changes to habits are rarely sustainable. That's why Hardesty recommends mindful eating throughout the year.</p>



<p>"With so much of our family and social time structured around food and the act of eating during the holidays, it's no wonder that we feel like we need a reset to our eating habits this time of year when the celebrations are over," says Hardesty. "But there are healthier, more sustainable ways to approach eating habits."</p>



<p>Here are Hardesty's recommendations to lessen your responsiveness to food triggers.</p>



<p><strong>Identify your "why."</strong> Adopting a healthy eating mindset starts with identifying the reasons you want to eat healthier. What compelling reasons come up when you consider this question?</p>



<p><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> Having a plan is one of the most important things you can do. Anticipate when you may have more difficulty making healthy choices and create a solid plan for those times.</p>



<p><strong>Slow down.</strong> Instead of moving from dish to dish, first survey the options in front of you and decide which ones you want and how much you want before adding food to your plate. Then, when you sit down to eat, savor your food and focus mindfully to help you make better choices compared to eating without conscious thought.</p>



<p><strong>Allow for indulgences.</strong> It's also important to allow yourself a few unhealthy food options but decide when and where you will make those choices. When you eat those lower quality foods, be aware of your negative emotions and don’t allow shame to perpetuate overindulgences.</p>



<p><strong>Additional techniques to help modify your eating behavior include:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Bringing fruit and vegetables to holiday gatherings to create more options for yourself and others.</li>



<li>Eating a light snack before attending holiday events to lessen the likelihood of overeating.</li>



<li>Measuring and portioning your food over the holidays.</li>



<li>Increasing your level of activity and exercise.</li>



<li>Committing to making changes with someone close to you.</li>



<li>Banking your calories if you know you'll attend an event with more food options available.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Don't despair if you temporarily lose control of your food choices," says Hardesty. "Remember, consistency is key – not perfection."</p>

<p>Hormone changes are a natural part of aging, but the experience is different for men and women. Unlike the more dramatic plunge that occurs in women during menopause, sex hormone changes in men occur gradually. This is sometimes called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/mens-health/in-depth/male-menopause/art-20048056?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">male menopause</a>.</p>



<p>For women, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a> marks the end of their menstrual cycles, whether by naturally declining reproductive hormones, surgical removal of the ovaries, changes caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or a conditional called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-ovarian-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20354683?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary ovarian insufficiency</a>. Ovulation ends and hormone production plummets during a relatively short period of time.</p>



<p>In men, production of testosterone and other hormones declines over a period of many years and the consequences aren't necessarily clear. This gradual decline of testosterone levels is called late-onset hypogonadism or age-related low testosterone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Recognizing low testosterone levels</strong></h2>



<p>A man's testosterone levels decline on average about 1% a year after 40. But most older men still have testosterone levels within the normal range, with only an estimated 10% to 25% having levels considered to be low.</p>



<p>Low testosterone levels in older men often goes unnoticed. Testosterone levels can be checked by a blood test, but tests aren't done routinely. And many men who have low testosterone levels experience no symptoms. In addition, the signs and symptoms associated with low testosterone aren't specific to low testosterone. They also can be caused by a person's age, medication use, or other conditions, such as having a body mass index of 30 or higher.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms suggestive of low testosterone include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced sexual desire and activity.</li>



<li>Decreased spontaneous erections or erectile dysfunction.</li>



<li>Breast discomfort or swelling.</li>



<li>Infertility.</li>



<li>Height loss, low trauma fracture or low bone mineral density.</li>



<li>Hot flushes or sweats.</li>
</ul>



<p>Other possible symptoms include decreased energy, motivation and confidence; depressed mood; and poor concentration. It's also possible to experience increased sleepiness; sleep disturbances; mild, unexplained anemia; reduced muscle bulk and strength; and increased body fat.</p>



<p>Experts recommend only testing older men for low testosterone if they have signs or symptoms. If an initial test shows low testosterone, the test should be repeated to confirm the results. If low testosterone is confirmed, further testing of the pituitary gland is recommended to determine the cause and rule out other hormone deficiencies. The pituitary gland is a kidney-bean-sized gland situated at the base of your brain. It is part of your body's endocrine system, which consists of all the glands that produce and regulate hormones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Recommendations on <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/sexual-health/in-depth/testosterone-therapy/art-20045728?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testosterone therapy</a> for men with age-related low testosterone vary. In 2020, the American College of Physicians recommended that healthcare professionals consider starting testosterone treatment in men with sexual dysfunction who want to improve their sexual function, after explaining the risks and benefits. In 2018, the Endocrine Society recommended testosterone therapy for men with age-related low testosterone who have signs and symptoms associated with low testosterone.</p>



<p>Some experts also recommend offering testosterone treatment to men with age-related low testosterone without the presence of signs or symptoms.</p>



<p>If you choose to start testosterone therapy, your healthcare professional will explain the different ways testosterone can be administered, target levels and follow-up testing.</p>



<p>For some men, testosterone therapy relieves bothersome signs and symptoms of testosterone deficiency. For others, the benefits aren't clear, and there are possible risks.</p>



<p>Though further research is needed, testosterone therapy might stimulate growth of metastatic prostate and breast cancer. Testosterone therapy also may increase the risk of heart attack and stroke and contribute to the formation of blood clots in the veins.</p>



<p>Your healthcare team likely will recommend against starting testosterone therapy if your fertility is important in the near future or if you have conditions such as breast or prostate cancer, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, uncontrolled heart failure, or thrombophilia, or if you've recently had a heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>If you think you might have low testosterone, talk to your healthcare team about your signs and symptoms, testing, and possible treatment options. They can help you weigh the pros and cons of treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (:56) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Script-MCM-Salmonella.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Salmonella is a bacterial infection that affects the intestinal tract.</p>



<p>"Salmonella is contracted through poorly cooked foods — such as meat, poultry, eggs, milk — poor water conditions or poor sanitation," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>The infection also can be spread through human and animal feces.</p>



<p>"Salmonella may cause an intestinal infection, such as having diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, and, in some cases, fever," he says.</p>



<p>The good news is that, generally, cases will resolve on their own within a few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"In some cases, with severe illness, where it's unrelenting beyond a few days, seeking prompt medical attention is very important," says Dr. Bracamonte.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how can you protect yourself?</p>



<p>Be careful when preparing food, especially raw meat and poultry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevent cross-contamination of foods, and most importantly, wash your hands.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Causes of salmonella infection</h3>



<p>People can become ill from infection from a variety of sources. Commonly infected foods include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Raw meat, poultry and seafood</strong><br>Feces may get onto raw meat and poultry during the butchering process. Seafood may be contaminated if harvested from contaminated water.</li>



<li><strong>Raw eggs</strong><br>While an egg's shell may seem to be a perfect barrier to contamination, some infected chickens produce eggs that contain salmonella before the shell is even formed. Raw eggs are used in homemade versions of mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.</li>



<li><strong>Fruits and vegetables</strong><br>Some fresh produce, particularly imported varieties, may be hydrated in the field or washed during processing with water contaminated with salmonella. Contamination also can occur in the kitchen when juices from raw meat and poultry come into contact with uncooked foods, such as salads.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some pet foods, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/kiambu-11-23/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dry dog food</a>, may be contaminated with salmonella and can infect animals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Bracamonte says salmonella also is harbored in some animals,&nbsp;such as reptileacs and birds. So if you have those pets, it's important that you wash your hands appropriately after handling them.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve heard "a calorie is a calorie" when it comes to weight loss, but can that really be true? With the number of diets out there (keto, intermittent fasting, Mediterranean), I'm completely overwhelmed with what I'm meant to be doing.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Yes and no. (Isn't that always the answer to nutrition inquiries?) While a calorie <em>may</em> be a calorie when it comes to the mathematical equation of weight loss, there's more to it. Calories are a unit of energy. The total calories a food or beverage provides depend on the number of grams of carbohydrates, protein, fat and/or alcohol contained. The number of calories, though, does not predict how we'll feel afterward.</p>



<p>For example, a 200-calorie snack of an apple with peanut butter is going to help you feel fuller and more satisfied than a 200-calorie snack of chips. The difference is in not only the food composition but food volume as well. The apple and peanut butter snack will provide fiber, fat, water and some protein. The majority of these attributes are lacking when it comes to the chips.</p>



<p>Think volume too — the apple snack will stretch the stomach more due to its larger size, sending that fullness signal to the brain. The 200 calories worth of chips also are going to be digested and leave the stomach faster than the apple because there's not much breakdown that needs to happen.</p>



<p>We also can't talk about this topic without referencing health outcomes. It is well known that the composition of one's diet, or dietary pattern, is significant. A plant-based diet containing whole grains, fruits, vegetables, unsaturated fats and lean proteins provides the body with balanced nutrition that can decrease the risk of chronic conditions.</p>



<p>There are multiple ways to do this healthfully. Diet styles such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mediterranean</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">DASH</a> and the <a href="https://diet.mayoclinic.org/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Diet</a> are examples of eating patterns that focus on high nutrient density and have been shown to promote positive health outcomes. This also can be done through a well-planned <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegetarian diet</a>. It's important to take both your food preferences and health concerns or goals into account.</p>



<p>So what about weight loss? Here's where calories are crucial. For example, even a Mediterranean diet does not guarantee weight loss if a calorie deficit is not present. Olive oil and nuts are excellent sources of healthy fat, but when eaten without one's total calorie intake in mind, it could, technically, cause weight gain. Using the style of eating that is best for you, consider working toward a 250-750 calorie per day deficit. This may be swapping your mid-afternoon snack for a piece of fruit or skipping your usual sweetened coffee or alcoholic beverage.</p>



<p>The body needs to burn more than it's consuming to produce weight loss. While exercise is always going to be recommended, it's important to remember that exercise alone is not likely to get most people into that roughly 500-calorie deficit. The majority of us will be most successful with weight loss through dietary changes.</p>



<p>Most diets work because adapting your baseline eating habits to fit a specific diet's protocol will likely cause you to eat fewer calories. Good news, right? Possibly. This is only going to benefit someone who can stay on said diet long term. Diets that endorse or require drastic and unrealistic changes (such as the cabbage soup diet) aren't sustainable. And when a diet is not sustainable, the weight loss won't be either.</p>



<p>So, start here:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose a healthful diet that fits your personal eating and health preferences.</li>



<li>Work toward a gradual calorie deficit, ideally limiting excess (more than you need) and empty (non-nutrition-providing) calories.</li>



<li>Remember that a slow, steady and sustainable approach is most likely to help you achieve a healthy weight. <span style="color: #000000"><em>—</em></span> <em><strong>Tara Schmidt, Registered Dietitian, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</strong></em></li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Two common types of inflammatory bowel disease</h3>



<p>IBD is a broad term for chronic inflammation of your digestive tract. Two types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</p>



<p>“Ulcerative colitis really tends to only involve the colon and be more of a superficial type inflammation; whereas Crohn's disease can impact anything in the intestine, essentially, from the mouth all the way down to the anus," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<p>She says diet alone does not cause IBD. While some foods may reduce symptoms, there is no one proven diet to control inflammation.</p>



<p>"The right diet is probably different for each individual, based on the type of IBD that they have, the location of their disease, whether they've had surgeries or other complications," says Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p>Focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid ultraprocessed foods, added sugars and animal fats. And drink plenty of fluid to stay hydrated.</p>



<p>Diet does not replace medical treatment. Dr. Johnson says there are effective <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20353325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> options, so it is important to work with your healthcare provider.</p>



<p>"The tenant of therapy we have are immune-suppressing-type therapies that try to target that inappropriate response to the intestines and then calm down that inflammation within the gut," she says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>I'm pregnant with my second child. During the 20-week anatomy scan, my obstetrician detected my baby has a cleft lip. Does this mean my baby also has a cleft palate? How and when is a cleft lip or cleft palate corrected?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cleft-palate/symptoms-causes/syc-20370985?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cleft lip and cleft palate</a> are openings or splits in the upper lip, the roof of the mouth — called the palate — or both. Cleft lip and cleft palate occur when the facial structures that are developing in an unborn baby don't close completely. While a cleft lip can form independently, it's more commonly found in combination with a cleft palate.</p>



<p>These are among the most common birth defects. Typically, cleft lip and palate happen in isolation, but occasionally, it is part of a genetic syndrome that includes cleft lip or cleft palate as one of its signs. Cleft lip and palate also can be associated with heart conditions, which often can be screened for and identified prenatally. It is important to be assessed by a genetic counselor to rule out any inherited diseases.</p>



<p>Generally, a cleft lip is repaired around the time when a child is 10 to 12 weeks old to ensure your child has established their feeding pattern and shows good weight gain. To close the separation in your child's lip, the surgeon makes incisions on both sides of the cleft and creates flaps of tissue. The flaps and lip muscles are then stitched together. This approach improves the lip's appearance, structure and function.</p>



<p>For a cleft palate, the repair is usually planned when the child is between 10 and 12 months old. The wait from birth to surgery for a cleft palate is longer because it allows more time for the mouth to grow. To close and rebuild the roof of the mouth requires access to a small space in the littlest of patients.</p>



<p>Children diagnosed with cleft palate are monitored closely for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ear-infections/symptoms-causes/syc-20351616?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ear infections</a>. A cleft palate can affect the function of the eustachian tube, a small tube connecting your middle ear down to your throat. The muscles of your palate help open and close your eustachian tubes. Babies are assessed for the development of chronic fluid in the middle ear and a hearing test is performed to assess your child's ability to hear. Ear tubes may be placed at the time of the cleft lip surgery or, if present, at the time of the cleft palate surgery. Sometimes ear tubes can be placed in an office setting under no anesthesia.</p>



<p>In preparation for their cleft lip or palate repair surgery, your child may be a candidate for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ask-the-mayo-mom-healing-from-cleft-lip-and-cleft-palate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nasoalveolar molding</a>, a nonsurgical option that helps reduce the gap in the upper lip and cleft on the roof of the mouth. It also can reshape your child's nostrils. Surgery is performed after the molding is complete at around 3 to 4 months. Nasoalveolar molding can significantly improve your child's outcomes and reduce their need for additional corrective operations as they grow.</p>



<p>Having a baby born with a cleft lip or palate can be concerning, but these conditions can be corrected. Advancements in operations result in better outcomes for your child by improving function and reducing scarring. However, it is important to seek treatment from centers such as Mayo Clinic, which specializes in treating cleft lip and palate.</p>

<p>CHETEK, Wis. – The hustle and bustle of the holiday season can be a fun, exciting time. However, holiday decorations, parties and cold weather can pose threats to children.</p>



<p>"The décor, the gifts and the fun outdoor activities can be a lot of fun for families, especially children," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/peter-reisner-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Reisner, M.D.</a>, a family medicine physician at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/chetek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Chetek, Wisconsin</a>. "But parents should be aware of the hidden dangers they may not be thinking about when putting up the Christmas tree or heading out for an afternoon of sledding."</p>



<p>Dr. Reisner recommends these safety tips while preparing for the holidays:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Manage your Christmas tree.</strong></h2>



<p>If you have a real tree, ensure the tree stand is always filled with water so the tree doesn't dry out and pose an increased fire hazard. If you buy an artificial tree, make sure it is made from fire-retardant material. Make sure the stand is flat on the ground and decorate the tree to equally distribute weight.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Keep flames away.</strong></h2>



<p>Don't leave children alone in a room with lighted candles, matches, lighters, fireplaces, or any other sources of flame or heat.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Watch for tempting seasonal decor.</strong></h2>



<p>Keep decorations out of reach of children and secured to the wall. Any object small enough to fit through a toilet paper tube can obstruct a child's airway. Closely supervise children if they're helping you decorate, especially when handling lighting, ornaments and breakable objects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Keep plants out of little hands.</strong></h2>



<p>Keep mistletoe, holly berries and poinsettias out of reach of children, as each is toxic when ingested.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Remember electricity safety.</strong></h2>



<p>Use power strips with built-in circuit breakers. Avoid putting too many plugs into one electrical outlet. Keep cords out of the way or behind furniture, and insert electrical outlet covers into unused outlets. Purchase lights with the UL Listed mark, which certifies that the product has been tested to meet safety requirements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Find safe toys.</strong></h2>



<p>Make sure your children's toys are age-appropriate and the batteries cannot be easily removed. Batteries shaped like disks, or button batteries, pose a choking risk to young children. Avoid placing gifts under the tree that contain glass, perfume or cologne, poisonous substances or sharp materials.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Monitor alcohol in the home.</strong></h2>



<p>Keep alcohol out of reach of children. Quickly clean up leftover drinks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Bundle up and use safety gear.</strong></h2>



<p>Dress children properly for the weather, making sure that their hands, feet and heads are covered. Supervise children and make sure they wear the correct safety gear for sledding, skiing, snowboarding, ice skating and other outdoor activities.</p>



<p>"Carefully inspecting your home and taking care of any safety hazards can ensure you and your children have a happy and safe holiday season," says Dr. Reisner.</p>

<p>Whole grains are an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/whole-grains/art-20047826?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">important part of healthy diet</a>. They are good sources of complex carbohydrates, as well as some key vitamins and minerals. And because whole grains are naturally high in fiber, they may help you feel full and satisfied, which can make it easier to maintain a healthy body weight. Eating more whole-grain foods also can <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/expert-answers/whole-grain-foods/faq-20058417?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lower your blood pressure</a>.</p>



<p>Some people, though, have a medical diagnosis that means they must avoid the gluten in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celiac disease</a>, also called celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an immune reaction to eating gluten. While the cause of celiac disease isn't known, the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-more-people-are-developing-celiac-disease/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disease is becoming more common</a>.</p>



<p>If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents it from absorbing some nutrients. The intestinal damage often causes diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating and anemia. And it can lead to serious complications.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/gluten-free-diet/art-20048530?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gluten-free diet</a> is essential to manage signs and symptoms of celiac disease and other medical conditions associated with gluten, including nonceliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wheat-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20378897?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wheat allergy</a>.</p>



<p>Following a gluten-free diet requires paying careful attention to food selections, the ingredients found in foods and their nutritional content, as well as medications.</p>



<p>Removing wheat, barley and rye from your diet may seem daunting. Trace amounts of gluten in your diet can be damaging, even if they don't cause signs or symptoms. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352225?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gluten can be hidden</a> in foods and nonfood products, including medications, vitamin and mineral supplements, toothpaste and mouthwash. A dietitian can help you plan a healthy, gluten-free diet. </p>



<p>And you can still enjoy the health benefits of eating whole grains. Options in a gluten-free diet include buckwheat, corn, flax, millet, quinoa and rice. While oats are naturally gluten-free, they may be contaminated during production with wheat, barley or rye. Oats and oat products labeled as gluten-free have not been cross-contaminated. However, some people with celiac disease cannot tolerate the oats labeled as gluten-free.</p>

<p>In 2017, Cindy Sutherland caught a nasty cold she couldn't shake. After coughing nonstop for weeks, she went to urgent care and got a chest X-ray. When the doctor shared the results with her, he asked, "Have you ever heard of pulmonary fibrosis?" Cindy started to cry because she knew what those words meant. Her grandmother had died of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-fibrosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary fibrosis</a> at the age of 62. Her mother had died of it at 58, and her sister at 48.</p>

<p>The progressive lung disease can be traced to a variety of causes — autoimmune conditions, radiation treatments, specific medications or chemotherapeutic agents, toxins like asbestos or coal dust and environmental factors like mold. Recently, researchers have begun to recognize that a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33935155/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subset of cases can be attributed to genetics</a>. Some patients with pulmonary fibrosis have shortened telomeres, the caps on the ends of chromosomes that protect cells from aging. Identifying these patients is critical because, in their case, certain treatments like immunosuppressive therapies could be dangerous.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Eva-Carmona-Porquera-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379089" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Eva-Carmona-Porquera-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Eva-Carmona-Porquera.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Eva Carmona Porquera, M.D., Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"I think it is way more frequent than we realize," says Sutherland’s pulmonologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/carmona-porquera-eva-m-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eva Carmona Porquera, M.D., Ph.D.</a> She is part of a large, multidisciplinary team at Mayo Clinic developing new ways to detect and treat pulmonary fibrosis cases caused by shortened telomeres.</p>



<p>"This is new territory," says Dr. Carmona Porquera. "The good thing is that at Mayo, we can offer genetic testing and telomere testing to our patients to classify, treat and prepare for complications associated with telomere biology disorders."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A rare and complex disorder</strong></h2>



<p>Telomere biology disorders are rare diseases caused by mutations that accelerate telomere shortening. Patients with these disorders are susceptible to a variety of age-related conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, bone marrow failure, osteoporosis, cancer and liver fibrosis. Many but not all patients show outward signs of premature aging, such as premature graying of hair or brittle nails. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Patnaik_Mrinal_S-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379091" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Patnaik_Mrinal_S-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Patnaik_Mrinal_S.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mrinal Patnaik, M.B.B.S.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Hematologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/patnaik-mrinal-s-m-b-b-s/bio-00093620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mrinal Patnaik, M.B.B.S</a>., first encountered these disorders as a medical resident in the early 2000s. A patient in his thirties with completely gray hair had shown up with a malignant tumor at the head and neck cancer clinic where Dr. Patnaik was training. Doctors there did not realize he had a telomere biology disorder. The patient died a month later from complete bone marrow failure.</p>



<p>"That really hurt me deep down," says Dr. Patnaik. "I felt that there's so many of these patients who are going to be coming into different clinics and if I didn't step up and set up a program for them and educate all my colleagues and set up the infrastructure, we're going to see a lot more patients suffer."&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the help of the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, Dr. Patnaik established the Telomere Biology Disorders Clinic at the Rochester, Minnesota, campus in 2017. The clinic is multidisciplinary in nature, drawing expertise from hematologists, oncologists, pulmonologists, liver specialists, pharmacists, molecular biologists and genetic counselors. To date, the clinic has seen more than 100 patients with shortened telomeres.</p>



<p>"We are among the largest adult telomere biology disorder clinics in the country," says Dr. Patnaik, who plans to open similar clinics in Arizona and Florida.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No perfect way</strong></h2>



<p>The most frequent manifestation of a telomere biology disorder is pulmonary fibrosis, the scarring of lung tissue that can make it difficult to breathe. As telomeres become shorter and shorter, the chromosomes they are designed to protect can unravel and fray, like a shoelace that has lost its protective cap. Eventually, the telomeres become so short that cells stop dividing — a process known as senescence. Those senescent cells send off a slew of chemicals that act as flares, triggering inflammatory changes that damage and thicken the lungs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers hope that by diagnosing and treating the disease earlier, they can improve outcomes for patients.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Ferrer_Alejandro-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379090" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Ferrer_Alejandro-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Ferrer_Alejandro.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Telomere biology disorders are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29976374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typically diagnosed</a> by looking for shortened telomeres and testing for genetic mutations. "There are different techniques that have been developed over time to measure telomere length, and each one has pros and cons," says molecular biologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ferrer-alejandro-ph-d/bio-20503546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.</a> "Basically, there's no perfect way to do this."</p>



<p>One of the most common methods for measuring telomeres involves a technique known as Flow FISH, in which each telomere is labeled with a fluorescent marker and then fed into a machine that quantifies the average amount of fluorescence across all the telomeres on all the chromosomes in the cell. Other techniques involve sequencing to count the repetitive run of bases, TTAGGG, that makes up each telomere, again averaging the result.</p>



<p>"However, it's well-known in the field that it's not that all telomeres get shorter at the same time; it can be just one or two telomeres falling below a certain threshold that can cause disease," says Dr. Ferrer. "If you rely on a technique that uses the average, you could miss those cases."</p>



<p>Dr. Ferrer and collaborators within and outside Mayo Clinic devised a specialized sequencing technique called Telogator to assess the shortest telomere length of each chromosome.</p>



<p>"This test could have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value," says Dr. Patnaik.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Answers, finally</strong></h2>



<p>Even with the limitations of the current tests, the Telomere Biology Clinic is making a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=29804726&amp;query_hl=11&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive impact</a> on patients. Sutherland first visited the clinic in 2020 and learned that, on average, her telomere lengths fell below the first percentile. "Dr. Patnaik said they were the shortest telomeres he had ever seen," she recalls. Genetic testing revealed Sutherland had a mutation in the TERT gene, which codes for a protein called telomerase that is responsible for telomere maintenance.</p>



<p>The Mayo team estimates that they have identified a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33203829/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disease-causing variant in a telomere-associated gene</a> in only 40% of patients. In many cases, they have discovered genetic changes that may or may not cause disease — called variants of unknown significance — and have conducted functional studies in the laboratory to categorize the effect of those variants.</p>



<p>Sutherland says she felt relieved when she learned she had a genetic mutation. "You're always looking for a reason, a cause, an explanation for why this happened. Why did my grandmother, my mother and my sister pass of this horrible disease at such a young age?"</p>



<p>But that sense of relief was quickly replaced by one of foreboding for the mother of five. "I was absolutely, positively scared to death for my children."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Telomere biology disorders are subject to a troubling type of genetic inheritance known as genetic anticipation. The disorder tends to become more severe and appear at an earlier age as the mutation — and the shortened telomeres — are passed from one generation to the next. As a result, Sutherland worried not only that she had passed the condition on to her children, but also that they might inherit a form of the disease much worse than what she herself has experienced.</p>



<p>"These findings have repercussions for family members," says Dr. Carmona Porquera. "We can counsel patients: no smoking, no exposures that can cause more injury, be aware of certain symptoms. And we can start treating them earlier with anti-fibrotic drugs, which could slow the progression of the disease."</p>



<p>Sutherland has been taking anti-fibrotic drugs for the last six years. Though she often feels short of breath, at age 65, she still has the energy to babysit her grandchildren.</p>



<p>Recently, genetic testing revealed no inherited mutations in her family tree.</p>



<p>"Maybe this horrible disease will stop with me," she says. "That would be my greatest wish."</p>
