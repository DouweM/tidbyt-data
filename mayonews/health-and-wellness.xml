<p>For some people, migraines are debilitating. The intense, throbbing head pain is often so severe that it feels like the head will explode.</p>



<p>"When people have migraine, they typically do have pain, typically moderate or severe pain, but they have other symptoms that go along with that," says Dr. Halker Singh.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What triggers migraines?</h3>



<p>A migraine is a neurologic disease that affects people differently. Some migraine sufferers experience sensitivity to light, sound and smells.</p>



<p>"It can impact their quality of life. It can impact their day. They typically have attacks which can be unpredictable," Dr. Halker Singh explains.</p>



<p>Extreme weather can affect various changes in the brain and cause a migraine.</p>



<p>"Many people say that barometric pressure changes and changes in the weather, but some people say it's the heat that triggers them," says Dr. Halker Singh.</p>



<p>It's crucial for migraine sufferers to stick to a routine and get plenty of exercise and rest.&nbsp; Also, it's important to stay hydrated during the summer.</p>



<p>"We really need to be careful about maintaining as much hydration as we can. And I think sometimes we don't even realize we're dehydrated. It just happens," she says.</p>

<p>"Fifth disease is a relatively common infection in childhood," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rajapakse-nipunie-s-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20308514?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse,</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;pediatric infectious diseases physician with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's Center</a>. "It has a few names. It's caused by a virus called parvovirus B19."</p>



<p>&nbsp;For most children, symptoms are mild.</p>



<p>"The most common symptoms that children will usually have with this infection are fever, maybe some runny nose and then a characteristic rash that usually turns their cheeks bright red, and then they may develop a more kind of lacy-looking rash on their extremities and trunk," she says.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality sound bites with Dr. Rajapakse are available in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Name super/CG: Nipunie Rajapakse, M.D./Pediatric Infectious Diseases/Mayo Clinic</strong>.</p>



<p>Adults infected with parvovirus 19 may have different symptoms than children.</p>



<p>Joint pain or swelling is less common but more frequent in adults. The virus also can temporarily stop the body from making new red blood cells, leading to anemia. People with sickle cell disease and weakened immune systems are at higher risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Rajapakse says parvovirus B19 spreads through respiratory secretions, such as contact with droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The virus can spread through blood and from a pregnant woman to her child. If a pregnant person suspects exposure to parvovirus B19, they should tell their healthcare team as soon as possible due to potential rare fetal complications if the mother lacks immunity.</p>



<p>"Parvovirus B19 is a viral infection that is quite common in childhood. If you test them, most adults show signs that they had this infection when they were a child," says Dr. Rajapakse. "The rash usually isn't causing too many symptoms, so it doesn't need any specific treatment. And as the child's body fights off the virus, the rash usually resolves along with that."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h3>



<p>There are no vaccines or medications to prevent infection, but there are ways to reduce your chances of getting infected or transmitting the infection to others.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>



<li>&nbsp;Practice good hand hygiene by covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing.</li>



<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.</li>



<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>



<li>Stay home and avoid others when you are sick.</li>
</ul>



<p>Parvovirus B19 affects only humans. You can't contract it or transmit it to dogs or cats. However, different parvoviruses can affect pets.</p>



<p>Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, got its name from being the fifth in a list of childhood illnesses known for causing a rash,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parvovirusb19/fifth-disease.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a>&nbsp;to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>



<p>In the U.S., the virus peaks in winter and spring. The CDC reports mini outbreaks every three to four years.</p>

<p>"A brain metastasis is a tumor that started elsewhere in the body that spread through the bloodstream and lodged itself in the brain," says Dr. Byrne.</p>



<p>This differs from a primary brain tumor, which starts in the brain and may require a different treatment approach.</p>

<p>"The different approaches that we take in treating brain metastases versus primary brain tumor depends on how many brain metastases there are because they often come in more than one and where they are and how large they are," says Dr. Byrne.</p>



<p>The tumor's location is also a factor in the treatment plan. A CT scan or MRI of the brain will confirm the diagnosis and create a road map for the care team to determine the next steps.</p>



<p>"After a patient is seen, and we do a history and physical exam and evaluate the imaging studies that they've had and any other data, then we come to the treatment plan," says Dr. Byrne. "And the treatment plan can vary from just watchful waiting and follow-up imaging all the way to a recommendation for radiation or surgery."</p>

<p>For many kids,&nbsp;summer is a time to stay up late, sleep in and hang out with friends. Waking up for that first day of a new school year can be a shock if young children, teenagers, parents or caregivers have not come up with a routine.</p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/whiteside-stephen-p-ph-d-l-p/bio-20054748?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stephen Whiteside</a>, a Mayo Clinic child psychologist, offers some tips for getting into a back-to-school routine.</p>

<p>Transitioning from a laid-back summer schedule to the structure of a new school year doesn't have to be a rude awakening. Dr. Whiteside says developing routines for morning,&nbsp;bedtime&nbsp;and any other recurring event can make things run more smoothly at home and at school.</p>



<p>"Routines are a natural part of life and just very straightforward, provide structure, help kids predict and expect what's going to happen," says Dr. Whiteside.</p>



<p>One way to help make the transition a little smoother is to give your family time to ease into the new routine.</p>



<p>"Taking a week or so before school starts to help kids start adjusting to waking up earlier, getting ready and having breakfast as soon as they get up," says Dr. Whiteside.</p>



<p>Dr. Whiteside says parents shouldn't stress if things don't go exactly as planned.</p>



<p>"Kids need to learn that they can handle change. And having a routine is good. Learning that you can handle life not following that routine is equally good," says Dr. Whiteside.</p>

<p>Historically, men have been hesitant to seek medical attention when something seems wrong with their health. Also, men aren't as likely as women to have preventive screenings and checkups with their healthcare team. This is a problem because early detection of a medical issue is the best way to treat and manage it effectively.</p>



<p>Why should you reconsider your reservations about seeing a healthcare professional? Delaying or avoiding a checkup or screening could lead to a treatable situation turning deadly.</p>



<p>While you should get some screenings, such as HIV and hepatitis C, you should have other screenings for certain conditions and cancers regularly.</p>



<p>Vaccines also are essential to prevent infectious diseases. Vaccinations for men are administered at different intervals throughout adulthood.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Regular physical exams</h2>



<p>Males older than 50 should have a yearly physical exam, and those younger than 50 should have a physical exam every three to five years. Even if you're feeling healthy, a regular checkup with your healthcare team is an excellent way to validate your health or identify a problem in its early stages.</p>



<p>Another thing to think about: Health isn't only physical. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/trust-primary-care-provider" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Talk to your healthcare team</a> about your mental and emotional health. If you're struggling in those areas, effective help is available.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Screening can identify specific conditions and cancers, including:</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Abdominal aortic aneurysm</h4>



<p>For men between 65 and 75 who have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends a one-time abdominal aortic aneurysm screening ultrasound. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the aorta, the major blood vessel that supplies blood to the body. Because the aorta is the body's main supplier of blood, a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm can cause life-threatening bleeding. Men over 60 with a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm should consider repeat screening at regular intervals.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Colon cancer</h4>



<p>Colon cancer screening should begin at age 45 or 10 years prior to an age at which an immediate relative was diagnosed with colon cancer. For example, get screened at age 36 if your mother was diagnosed at age 46. A colonoscopy is a traditional, effective procedure to identify colon cancer or precancerous polyps. A more recent noninvasive option available is a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stool-dna-test/about/pac-20385153" target="_blank">take-home test to screen for colon cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Talk to your healthcare professional about which option is best for you.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Diabetes</h4>



<p>If you're older than 45 or have a body mass index above 25, no matter your age, the American Diabetes Association recommends that you be screened for diabetes. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/how-to-live-well-with-diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Type 2 diabetes</a> and prediabetes symptoms can happen slowly and may not be noticeable, so staying aware of your blood sugar levels and risk of developing diabetes is essential.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">High blood pressure</h4>



<p>A blood pressure reading is a good indication to many aspects of your health. High blood pressure can lead to many physical problems, especially those associated with the heart.</p>



<p>You should have your blood pressure checked at least every two years. However, talk to your healthcare professional about having it checked more frequently if you have <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/know-your-heart-health-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a> or are at risk of developing high blood pressure.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">High cholesterol</h4>



<p>Like high blood pressure, high cholesterol may pose serious risks to your health and well-being. Starting at age 18, men at average risk for heart disease should have a cholesterol screening every five years. If you have a family history of high cholesterol or heart attacks, smoke, eat a poor diet, are overweight, have diabetes, are physically inactive or older than 45, you may need more frequent testing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Lung cancer</h4>



<p>The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with a low-dose CT for adults ages 50 to 80 who have a 20-pack-per-year smoking history, currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening can be stopped when a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Prostate cancer</h4>



<p>Many organizations advise men to be screened for prostate cancer starting at age 50. However, the subject is somewhat controversial, so the best course of action is to discuss what's best for you with your healthcare team.</p>



<p>Do yourself and your family a favor by protecting your health with regular checkups and screenings.</p>

<p>As the back-to-school season approaches, parents and guardians have much to consider for their children to have a healthy and successful start to the new academic year. From scheduling well-child examinations to planning for proper nutrition and adequate sleep, the list of tasks may feel daunting.</p>



<p>Here are back-to-school tips to help you and your children prepare.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Well-child examinations</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/schedule-your-childs-back-to-school-physical" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Well-child examinations</a> are a cornerstone of healthcare for children of all ages. These check-ups are essential for monitoring your child's growth and development, catching potential health issues early and ensuring they are physically and mentally prepared for school.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">During a well-child examination, the healthcare team will:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Create a comprehensive medical history, which is crucial for future healthcare needs.</li>



<li>Identify and manage potential health problems before they become more serious.</li>



<li>Monitor and track your child's growth patterns and development.</li>



<li>Update your child's medical history and verify that vaccinations are current.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vaccinations</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-facts-about-vaccinations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vaccinations play a critical role</a> in protecting children from various infectious diseases. Illnesses can quickly spread, so ensuring your child is current on vaccinations is vital.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and healthcare professionals recommend these vaccinations:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Diptheria/tetanus/pertussis</li>



<li>Haemophilus influenza B</li>



<li>Hepatitis A</li>



<li>Hepatitis B</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/hpv-immunization-who-can-benefit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human papilloma virus</a></li>



<li>Influenza</li>



<li>Meningococcal</li>



<li>MMR</li>



<li>Pneumococcal</li>



<li>Polio</li>



<li>Rotavirus</li>



<li>Varicella (chickenpox)</li>
</ul>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team about vaccines your state requires to attend school.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nutrition</h2>



<p>A balanced diet is fundamental to a child's physical and cognitive development. Proper nutrition helps children maintain energy levels, concentrate better in school and support overall growth and development. Children require different amounts of nutrients based on their age.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Follow these nutrition tips for your family:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Encourage your child to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, especially during the warmer months.</li>



<li>Minimize sugary snacks and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-buzz-on-energy-drinks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sweetened beverages</a> to help prevent obesity and dental problems.</li>



<li>Offer meals made from fresh foods, including dairy, fruits, protein, vegetables and whole grains.</li>



<li>Provide nutritious snacks like fruits, nuts and yogurt to energize your child throughout the day.</li>



<li>Start every day with breakfast.</li>



<li>Visit <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Healthy-Active-Living-for-Families.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Healthy Active Living for Families</a> to learn about the 5-2-1-0 rule.</li>
</ul>



<p>Talk with your child's healthcare team if you have questions about your child's nutritional needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sleep</h2>



<p>Adequate sleep is crucial for a child's overall well-being, affecting everything from their mood to their ability to learn and retain information. Children who do not get enough sleep are more likely to experience attention problems, behavioral issues and poor academic performance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for ensuring adequate sleep include:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Create a consistent bedtime routine to help your child wind down and prepare for sleep.</li>



<li>Encourage your child to get the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/sleep-an-essential-element-of-success-for-children" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended amount of sleep</a> each night, typically eight to 10 hours for school-aged children.</li>



<li>Ensure your child's bedroom is quiet, dark and cool to facilitate restful sleep.</li>



<li>Reduce exposure to screens at least an hour before bedtime to promote better sleep quality and remove screens from the room at bedtime.</li>



<li>Try a red light in the bedroom, which may help release melatonin naturally. Avoid using a blue light.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bullying</h2>



<p>Bullying is a serious issue that can significantly affect a child's mental and emotional health. It occurs far too often nationwide in elementary, junior high and high schools. Parents and guardians must <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/cyberbullying-tips-to-protect-kids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take bullying seriously</a> and teach your children a few tactics to address bullies productively.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Steps to take if bullying occurs:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ask a teacher or other school officials for help.</li>



<li>Don't fight back and maintain composure.</li>



<li>Say "stop" confidently.</li>



<li>Walk away.</li>
</ul>



<p>It's crucial to offer emotional support and reassurance to your child. If needed, consider professional counseling to help them cope with the effects of bullying.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Creating a positive start to the school year</h2>



<p>Preparing for the new school year involves more than buying school supplies and updating the calendar with activities. It's also about prioritizing your child's health and well-being to ensure their success and happiness.</p>



<p>By scheduling well-child examinations, keeping vaccinations up to date, providing balanced nutrition, ensuring adequate sleep, addressing bullying and modeling these healthy habits yourself, you can help your child have a healthy, productive and successful school year.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (0:57) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post.&nbsp;Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."&nbsp;Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/10/Script-MCM-Weekend-Warrior-Exercising.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Exercise is key to a healthy lifestyle.</p>



<p>For those on a time crunch, stacking weekly exercise into a couple of days comes with the title "weekend warrior."</p>



<p>“Things like running, jogging, high-intensity workouts, ideally, the more that you can do, the better. People that did this, lowered mortality, lowered cardiovascular events," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>At least <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">150 minutes</a> of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous activity is recommended for adults each week.</p>



<p>"We don't expect people that have gone from a sedentary activity of not doing anything to jumping into 150 minutes a week. So taking days of break in between, assessing how your body responds to that activity," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>Repeating the same motions or ramping up too quickly could lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/overuse-injury/art-20045875?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overuse injuries</a>, inflammation and pain.</p>



<p>“If you take a couple days off and it's still persistent pain with daily activity — pain that keeps you up at night or keeps you from sleeping — these are all things that we typically recommend people coming in to be evaluated," he says.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shah-meera-m-b-ch-b/bio-20114165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Meera Shah</a>, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist, says that if you want to lose weight permanently, you need to stay consistently active and eat a nutritious diet.</p>

<p>You step on the scale and the numbers are moving in the right direction after taking one of the popular injectable weight-loss drugs. But now you want to stop the medication, so what do you do? How long can you stay on these drugs?</p>



<p>"We just haven't had people on this class of medicines for long enough to know what happens in five years, even three years, and when might be the right time to withdraw people off these medicines," says Dr. Shah.</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9542252/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> show people regain weight after ditching diet drugs.</p>



<p>"If you stopped medication, say within six months of being on it, there's a very high chance for weight regain," explains Dr Shah.</p>



<p>This could have something to do with an increase in appetite once you stop taking weight-loss medications.</p>



<p>"What the medicine is doing is it's actually changing those appetite signals, but when you don't have that medicine on board, then your body goes back to its default state," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team before stopping these types of weight-loss drugs.&nbsp; It's also a good idea to eat a balanced diet and stay active.</p>
