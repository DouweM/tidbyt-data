<p>In the early 1990s, ankle braces began appearing more often on sports courts and playing fields due to their improved designs. They also cost less than repeatedly taping an athlete's ankle.</p>



<p>Now, ankle braces are available in various designs, including sport-specific options. But the goal is the same — to provide extra support after an injury or prevent an ankle sprain from occurring in the first place.</p>



<p>Coaches, parents and athletes often ask if wearing an ankle brace is worthwhile. Research shows that high school-age athletes who use ankle braces experience fewer ankle injuries. However, ankle braces don't reduce the severity of ankle, knee or other lower-extremity injuries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How bracing works</h2>



<p>Bones, muscles and a network of ligaments and tendons form internal supports that keep your ankle stable, flexible and strong. Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that stabilize joints and help prevent excessive movement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Three main bones make up the ankle joint:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Tibia</strong>&nbsp;— the long shin bone in your lower leg that provides the main weight-bearing surface at the roof of the ankle joint</li>



<li><strong>Fibula</strong>&nbsp;— the bone on the outside of the ankle that provides lateral and rotational stability</li>



<li><strong>Talus</strong>&nbsp;— the bone that provides the lower cartilage in the ankle and connects the ankle to the foot, functioning like a hinge to flex your foot</li>
</ul>



<p>These internal supports link your foot all the way up to your hip. Ideally, they function as a unit.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/-/media/national-files/images/hometown-health/2024/ankle-anatomy-illustration.jpg?h=221&amp;w=351&amp;sc_lang=en&amp;hash=B2BBB5544EF5A5629A43DE97F4CF7B81" alt="Ankle anatomy illustration"></p>



<p>Ankle braces serve as external supports to limit certain motions, such as plantar flexion/inversion, which is the movement at the ankle joint that points the foot downward away from the leg and turns the foot inward.</p>



<p>Braces also provide awareness of where your ankle joint is in space. For maximum effectiveness, ankle braces should fit comfortably in the shoes you wear during an activity, which also makes it more likely you'll wear the braces.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rehabilitation plays a key role in recovery</h2>



<p>If you do experience an ankle injury, weakness or instability, rehabilitation is a key component of your treatment plan. Often, when athletes still have ankle pain or aren't back to full function, it's because they haven't allowed enough time to heal properly. Rehabilitation providers specialize in balance, range of motion, strength and endurance, which are key therapy and training factors for recovery.</p>



<p>Performing exercises as directed helps ensure a safe return to activity and lessens the likelihood of reinjury.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deciding if a brace is right for you</h2>



<p>Keep in mind that wearing an ankle brace isn't a 100% cure-all or guarantee against injuries. Your healthcare team can help you make an educated decision about whether an ankle brace is right for you.</p>

<p>Starting a workout program or being physically active takes motivation and commitment. The key is to start slowly and do something you take pleasure in.</p>



<p>"If you hate swimming, don't try to start to become a swimmer. But (if) you enjoy dancing or other activities (such as) gardening, those are forms of activity that once you engage in, you increase your consistency and compliance that will have the most health benefits," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>

<p>Being active can build muscle strength and improve cognitive and cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>"Three percent, or 30 minutes a day, of our waking hours, if we commit that to physical activity, will have huge benefits," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>And for those young at heart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.</p>



<p>"As we get older, dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips to get started and stick with a workout plan:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Research workout routines.</li>



<li>Schedule your workouts.</li>



<li>Find an exercise buddy.</li>



<li>Be consistent.</li>

<p>Does your thumb hurt when you're scrolling on your phone? Is it made worse when gripping objects? You could be suffering from basilar thumb joint arthritis.</p>



<p>"Patients will typically complain, for example, in opening a jar, turning a key, opening a doorknob will cause pain," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-thumb-arthritis-original.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of thumb arthritis" class="wp-image-213373" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-thumb-arthritis-original.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-thumb-arthritis-original-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<p>In a normal thumb joint, bones are covered in cartilage, but with arthritis, the cartilage wears away, causing joint damage and pain.</p>



<p>"Which is basically pain as the thumb bone is grinding down every time you pinch a pound of pressure between the thumb and the index finger is magnified twelvefold," explains Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>Several <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378344">treatment options</a> are available to relieve aching joints, including medication, splints and, in some cases, surgery.</p>



<p>"We can do minimally invasive surgeries, for example, putting a camera in and cleaning it out. Or some of these nerves that give nerve endings to the bone, we actually get rid of those nerve endings to decrease the pain," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>In more advanced arthritis, surgeons either remove the arthritic bone or perform a joint replacement. If symptoms persist, see a certified hand therapist.</p>

<p>AUSTIN, Minn. ― For teens who love playing summer team sports, an injury that takes them out of the game can be devastating. Shoulder injuries are among the most common for athletes who play volleyball, tennis, swimming, football and a variety of others.</p>



<p>"The shoulder is an incredibly mobile joint that allows you to reach and rotate in a number of directions," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/robert-cates-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Cates, D.O.,</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/austin/services-and-treatments/orthopedic-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orthopedic Surgery and Sports Medicine</a>, Mayo Clinic Health System. "The design of the shoulder, like a golf ball on a tee, unfortunately makes it easy to slip out of place with enough force. That's why injuries are so common with contact sports."</p>



<p>People in their teens and 20s, because they tend to be more physically active, are at highest risk for shoulder dislocation. Also, people with looser joints can be prone to dislocation from smaller amounts of force.</p>



<p>However, if a shoulder becomes dislocated, it needs to be treated immediately. A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dislocated-shoulder/symptoms-causes/syc-20371715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dislocated shoulder</a> is easy to detect due to a look of deformity, lack of movement and intense pain.</p>



<p>Between the time of injury and medical treatment, don't move the joint or try to put it back in place. Use a sling or splint to hold it in its current position. Ice the joint to reduce pain and swelling.</p>



<p>"Treatment will include putting the joint back into the correct position. If the joint has been badly damaged, surgery might be required," says Dr. Cates. "Icing and anti-inflammatory medications will relieve pain and swelling. Physical therapy will be prescribed to help you regain range of motion and strength or prepare the shoulder for surgery."</p>



<p>If surgery is required, treatment can be arthroscopic, which involves making small incisions to allow the surgeon to repair the damage, or open (larger incision) if the damage is more severe. Recovery time will depend on the extent of the injury. For most people, a shoulder joint improves over a few weeks.</p>



<p>"If surgery was part of treatment, full recovery may take five or six months," says Dr. Cates. "We know how badly teens want to avoid missing out on the fun of playing sports, but the greatest risk during healing for any shoulder injury is returning to activities before the shoulder is stable."</p>



<p>The best way to prevent a shoulder dislocation is to concentrate on good mechanics and strength conditioning. However, competitive and casual athletes can experience this injury despite the best preparation because so many are caused by contact or falls.</p>

<p><em><strong>World Brain Day is July 22</strong></em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Fifteen million people worldwide have a <a href="https://www.emro.who.int/health-topics/stroke-cerebrovascular-accident/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a> each year. Of these, 5 million are left permanently disabled. An estimated 69 million people globally suffer <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29701556/#:~:text=Sixty-nine%20million%20%2895%25%20CI%2064-74%20million%29%20individuals%20worldwide,are%20estimated%20to%20sustain%20a%20TBI%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traumatic brain injuries</a> each year. <a href="https://www.cerebralpalsyguidance.com/cerebral-palsy/types/spastic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spastic cerebral palsy</a>, the most common form of cerebral palsy, accounts for 70% to 80% of all people diagnosed.</p>



<p>Patients living with physical changes from stroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy and other conditions may regain some function in their hands and arms — therefore improving their quality of life — thanks to advances in surgical options for upper motor neuron syndrome, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rhee-peter-c-d-o-m-s/bio-20346533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter C. Rhee, D.O.</a>, an orthopedic hand surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/upper-limb-reconstruction-umn-syndrome-clinic/overview/ovc-20466590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Upper motor neuron syndrome</a> refers to a dysfunction or deformity in the shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic or hypoxic brain injury, cerebral palsy, or spinal cord injury. People with this condition may have muscle weakness, decreased muscle control, altered muscle tone and spasticity.</p>



<p>Depending on the extent of the patient's disability, surgeons can perform a combination of joint fusions, tendon lengthenings, and tendon and nerve transfers. People with complete paralysis in their arms can still benefit from surgery by improving the position of their hands, wrist and elbows for hygiene or to enable basic functions that they have lost, Dr. Rhee says.</p>



<p>"The surgery aims to correct the deformity by treating individual muscles based on the underlying problems," says Dr. Rhee, who has been performing this surgery for the last 10 years. "We work on the nerves, muscles and joints. It's different for each patient, but the overall goal is to improve hygiene, improve function and improve quality of life."</p>



<p>Since patients may recover some function in the months after having a stroke, surgeons wait to perform the procedure until 12 to 18 months later. Initially, Dr. Rhee does a virtual visit to determine if the patient is a potential candidate for the surgery. If so, the patient comes in for specialized nerve tests and a formal in-person evaluation to fully determine if they would benefit from surgery.</p>



<p>"Regular exams give the surgeon a lot of information. The joint can be in a certain position because of spasticity or contraction," Dr. Rhee says. "Combining that with the nerve tests provides a comprehensive snapshot of what the muscles and nerves are doing to create the dysfunction and/or deformity."</p>



<p>Dr. Rhee uses the patient's test results to develop a tailored surgical plan.</p>



<p>When a person's entire arm is involved, Dr. Rhee will perform two surgeries, both on an outpatient basis, with a three-month wait between procedures. The first stage typically covers the shoulder, elbow and forearm; the second covers the wrist, fingers and thumb. Between surgeries, patients do stretching exercises at home as part of their treatment plan. The total process takes about six months.</p>



<p>"We have built an amazing team to give hope to patients who have had strokes, spinal cord or brain injuries, or adults with cerebral palsy," Dr. Rhee says.</p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. ― The summer weather inspires people of all ages to head outside and play sports. For seniors, pickleball has become a popular option, partly because the court is small enough that players don't need to move very far to hit the ball.</p>



<p>But even with a sport that's easier on a person's joints, many people still suffer unnecessarily playing on aching hips and knees that need replacement.</p>



<p>"Fear is often part of the reason someone postpones surgery. They may have heard stories about hip and knee replacements from many years ago when recovery was painful and grueling," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jacob-ziegler-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Ziegler, M.D., Orthopedics &amp; Orthopedic Surgery</a>, Mayo Clinic Health System. "That's far from the case now. These are still major surgeries, but new techniques and technologies have greatly improved patients' experiences and outcomes."</p>



<p>Among those technologies is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/robotic-orthopedic-surgery/overview/ovc-20472153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robotic-assisted joint replacement</a>, which has revolutionized hip and knee surgeries. This technology allows the surgeon to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Perform enhanced, 3D preoperative planning and modeling to ensure there's no impingement or pinching of nerves or tissues and to refine implant sizing and positioning for a high degree of accuracy.</li>



<li>Prepare the bone and insert the implants with an unprecedented level of precision.</li>



<li>Produce outcomes for patients that are more predictable and able to be reproduced in other patients.</li>
</ul>



<p>A new service Dr. Ziegler is offering is smart knee replacement. A chip in the knee replacement uploads information about gait and mobility to alert care teams on the patient's recovery.</p>



<p>"This service is particularly helpful to patients who live far from the hospital and don't have close access to follow-up care," says Dr. Ziegler. "We can intervene early if we receive data that any adjustments are needed. And if everything looks good, the patient then has the option to follow-up by phone or by virtual appointment."</p>



<p>Another rapidly advancing technology in orthopedic surgery is 3D printing, which allows the designing and creation of custom implants to address challenging problems, including deformities, bone loss and unusual hip or knee anatomy. This promising technology needs more long-term data before it becomes widely used. Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of 3D printing and has been integral in advancing its clinical applications.</p>



<p>If a total hip or knee replacement is in your future, here's what you can expect:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hip replacements</strong></h2>



<p>Any patient who is a candidate for a conventional total hip replacement is a candidate for a robotic-assisted total hip replacement.</p>



<p>Hip replacements no longer are a one-technique-fits-all approach. With a 360-degree approach, your surgeon can tailor the surgery to you, choosing from direct anterior, posterior or anterolateral approaches. The surgeon will discuss these options and the entire surgical experience in detail with you during your pre-op consultation.</p>



<p>For most patients, total hip replacement surgery is either a same-day surgery or a one-night hospital stay.</p>



<p>Patients can walk and navigate stairs right after surgery.</p>



<p>The majority of patients will follow a self-directed physical therapy plan at home, with no need to go to an outpatient physical therapy facility.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Knee replacements</strong></h2>



<p>As with hip replacements, any patient who is a candidate for a conventional total knee replacement is a candidate for robotic-assisted total knee replacement. You'll also take part in a comprehensive education experience and physical therapy assessment to review the technique your surgeon will use during surgery.</p>



<p>Like hip replacements, total knee replacements typically are same-day surgeries or may involve a one-night hospital stay.</p>



<p>Once you've awakened from the anesthesia, you can walk and navigate stairs. About one week after surgery, you'll begin meeting with a physical therapist who specializes in working with knee-replacement patients. For best results with strength and range of motion, you'll also be assigned daily exercises to do at home to supplement your physical therapy sessions at an outpatient facility.</p>



<p>"The great news is that for both total hip and knee replacements, the technology continues to evolve with the primary goals of reducing pain and enhancing function," says Dr. Ziegler. "We want to get you back on the pickleball court, or enjoying any other sport of choice, as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>EAU CLAIRE, Wis. ― When the weather has you enthused about fitness, the last thing you want is to be sidelined with joint pain.</p>



<p>"People might associate joint aches and pains with an older age group, but joint pain can affect people in all stages of life," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/amy-rantala-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Rantala, M.D.,</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/sports-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sports Medicine</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a>. "This can be frustrating because pain can be a barrier to maintaining regular exercise and enjoying being active in sports or other activities."</p>



<p>Preventing joint pain in the first place is the best course. A good first step if you want to join a sport or up your exercise goals is to check with your primary care provider or see a sports medicine specialist who can assess your overall fitness level, general mobility and if you have current injuries or pain.</p>



<p>They also may conduct a functional movement screening to evaluate how you move and pinpoint specific issues. For example, you may have decreased range of motion in a hip or shoulder or are stronger on one side than the other. This screening can identify specific rehabilitative exercises that can be done along with your regular exercise program. These exercises help your body move safely, perform exercises correctly, and reduce the risk for injury.</p>



<p>"When you do build an exercise program, make sure it's sustainable and incorporates cardio, strength building and flexibility," says Dr. Rantala. "Then ease your way into it. Don't go from 0 to 100 overnight because that can lead to injuries and sore joints."</p>



<p><strong>Some additional points to keep in mind:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Listen to your body. Don't overdo it. Take a break or tone down your activity for the rest of the day.</li>



<li>Keep a small problem small. If you're feeling recurring pain, get it checked out.</li>



<li>Build in time to recover between activity sessions. Our bodies need this time to rebuild and repair.</li>



<li>Work around your limitations. For example, if you have knee pain, using a reverse lunge or hex-bar squat helps reduces stress on your knees and allows you to target the same muscle groups.</li>
</ul>



<p>"If joint pain begins to restrict the activities you love, the best thing to do is consult an orthopedic or sports medicine specialist so the two of you can map out a plan for diagnosis and treatment to keep you active and enjoying your life," says Dr. Rantala. "Focus on playing the long game when it comes to sports and regular exercise by finding what works for your body long-term."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hip-dysplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350209">Hip dysplasia</a> is a condition where the ball and socket of the joint don't fit together quite right. This can lead to joint instability, bone and cartilage damage, early arthritis, and a lot of pain.</p>



<p>"There was always that tradition for pediatric hip surgery for young children. And there's always the field of hip replacement surgery for elder patients. And with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/news/hip-preservation-shoring-up-the-native-hip/mqc-20562457">hip preservation</a>, we're kind of bridging that gap," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grigoriou-emmanouil-m-d/bio-20538675">Dr. Emmanouil Grigoriou</a>, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic surgeon.</p>



<p>The goal, he adds, is "to allow patients to retain their own hip joint, their own cartilage, without any limitations or restrictions after surgery, enjoy years and years with their own native hip, and potentially even eliminate the need for any future hip replacement surgery."</p>



<p>Hip preservation surgery isn't for everyone, and outcomes are better when problems are diagnosed early when less arthritis is present. But for the right candidate, "we can take a patient from a fairly debilitating, painful state, to just giving their life back and their ability to be active and enjoy what they love," says Dr. Grigoriou.</p>

<p>Tommy John surgery is not just for baseball pitchers. Ask Kylie Donat of Bemidji, Minnesota.</p>



<p>Kylie is an 18-year-old high school swimmer, track and field athlete, and wrestler. She has been wrestling since 2021, the first year that girls' wrestling was a sanctioned high school sport in Minnesota. By 2023, Kylie was favored to win her weight class at the state championship.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2048" height="1153" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Finals-Match-state-tournament3-16x9-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389211" style="width:510px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Finals-Match-state-tournament3-16x9-1.jpg 2048w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Finals-Match-state-tournament3-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Finals-Match-state-tournament3-16x9-1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Finals-Match-state-tournament3-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Finals-Match-state-tournament3-16x9-1-1536x865.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo courtesy of David Peterson of Minnesota/USA Wrestling</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Then came the practice that changed everything.</p>



<p>In January 2023, her wrestling partner threw her down on the mat. Kylie tried to catch herself, but her left elbow bent awkwardly, and she heard popping sounds. A week later, she used the Heimlich technique on a teammate who was choking on her food. The maneuver worked, fortunately, but it made Kylie's injury – to her <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/orthopedic-surgery/news/ucl-injuries-defining-risk-and-improving-treatment/mac-20439338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medial ulnar collateral ligament</a> – worse.</p>



<p>"It was a complete rupture, as bad as it could be," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/camp-christopher-l-m-d/bio-20348631">Christopher Camp, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic surgeon who had a virtual appointment with Kylie in March 2023.</p>



<p>Despite the injury, Kylie was eager to return for her senior season and compete in the state championship. Dr. Camp put Kylie on a standard short course of nonoperative treatment consisting of rest and physical therapy to give the ligament time to heal and stabilize on its own. But it didn't stabilize, so surgery was the next step.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/cast-225x300.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-389212" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/cast-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/cast-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/cast-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/cast-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></figure></div>


<p>A week later, Dr. Camp performed the ligament reconstruction using the anatomic technique, a new approach he developed at Mayo Clinic. This procedure builds on Tommy John ligament reconstruction surgery, which was first performed on baseball pitcher Tommy John in 1974.</p>



<p>The injury is most common in baseball players, but it can affect athletes in other throwing sports such as softball and javelin. Wrestlers and gymnasts may sustain traumatic versions of the injury.</p>



<p>During surgery, Dr. Camp repaired Kylie's ligament, gave her a new one (taking a tendon from elsewhere in her body to form a new ligament) and added an InternalBrace (2-millimeter-wide suture tape) for stability.</p>



<p>"It's designed to recreate the normal anatomy of the ligament," Dr. Camp says. "It uses newer fixation and anchor devices that are smaller and stronger, and it increases the contact area between the graft and bone to create a larger surface area for healing."</p>



<p>Kylie went home the same day and began to focus on her recovery.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Got-her-brace-225x300.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-389213" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Got-her-brace-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Got-her-brace-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Got-her-brace-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Got-her-brace-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></figure></div>


<p>Once Kylie got her splint off and was fitted for a brace, she began her rehab in earnest. She did a lot of stretching so her injured arm could move like the other one. Once she got full movement back, she started building the muscles in her entire body and around the elbow, including the shoulder, bicep, tricep and forearm.</p>



<p>"Knowing that I had lost that opportunity (to compete) due to an injury, I was ready to get back out there," Kylie says. "I knew it would take a lot of work."</p>



<p>Kylie's mother, Sara Donat, says her daughter was determined, but knew she couldn't rush her recovery. Once Kylie was cleared to do pushups and work more of her muscles during physical therapy, she started to have hope. She added swimming to her regimen, which she knew would be good for her elbow and overall athletic shape. In October 2023, she wrestled for the Minnesota Storm in Iowa.</p>



<p>"After that, I was like, 'Wow! I'm really ready to wrestle,'" Kylie says.</p>



<p>Traditionally, the recovery from this type of surgery is a year or longer for a throwing athlete. For a wrestler, recovery is usually nine to 12 months. Kylie got back to wrestling in five months.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="558" height="314" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Final-Match-State-Champion2_16x9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389209" style="width:543px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Final-Match-State-Champion2_16x9.jpg 558w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Final-Match-State-Champion2_16x9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo Courtesy of Mark Beshey of The Guillotine</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"She did a great job on her rehab and physical therapy," Dr. Camp says. "She was extremely motivated and worked hard. We had a very clear goal – wrestling – so she could compete in the state tournament."</p>



<p>In March 2024, Kylie fulfilled her promise to herself by winning her weight class at the state wrestling tournament. Her elbow didn't cause any problems.</p>



<p>"It was the best feeling," she says.</p>

<p>Are you curious about whether seeing a sports medicine professional is right for you? These top five questions about sports medicine can help you with the answer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Do you need to be an athlete to benefit from a sports medicine evaluation or clinic appointment?</h2>



<p>Even if you don't consider yourself athletic but want to increase your physical activity or stay strong for your job, a sports medicine professional can be a great resource. They can tailor a plan to maximize your workout routine based on your interests and goals and help you reduce your risk of injury, whether you're on the field, at the gym or on a work site.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. What makes a primary care sports medicine physician qualified to treat people?</h2>



<p>These professionals have advanced training in the science of sports medicine. Sports medicine professionals can help maximize your body's systems and reduce pain so you can avoid time away from sports or other physical activities due to injuries.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The training these professionals undergo is extensive and includes:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Undergraduate training</li>



<li>Four years of medical school</li>



<li>Three to four years of residency training</li>



<li>One to two years of fellowship training</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition, primary care sports medicine physicians are required to pass a certification examination in sports medicine to obtain a Certificate of Added Qualification in Sports Medicine.</p>



<p>Sports medicine physicians are expected to complete continued medical education and recertification every 10 years to distinguish them from other physicians without this specialized training.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. What's the difference between a primary care sports medicine physician and an orthopedic sports medicine surgeon?</h2>



<p>An orthopedic sports medicine surgeon is trained in those areas, as well as surgical treatment of those conditions. Together, they create a comprehensive team to improve performance, prevent injury, guide rehabilitation, and relieve joint and muscle pain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. What types of conditions are treated by a sports medicine physician?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Common musculoskeletal and orthopedic conditions that sports medicine physicians treat include acute injuries, such as:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
