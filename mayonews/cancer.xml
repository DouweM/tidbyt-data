<p>National Mammography Day will be observed Saturday, Oct. 21, which makes this a good time to learn about the importance of breast cancer screening with mammograms.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breast cancer</a>&nbsp;accounts for 1 in 3 of all new cancers diagnosed in women in the U.S. each year, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. It's estimated that nearly 44,000 women in the U.S. will die from breast cancer this year.</p>



<p>Mammograms play a key role in early breast cancer detection. They can detect breast cancer before it causes signs and symptoms, decreasing breast cancer deaths.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Understanding your risk</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-cancer-risk-assessment/about/pac-20393195?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breast cancer risk assessment</a> takes into account several aspects of your gynecologic health, personal history of breast biopsies, breast density and family history to calculate whether you may be more likely than average to develop breast cancer. You and your healthcare team can use results from a breast cancer risk assessment to determine if you have an increased risk of breast cancer. A breast cancer risk assessment can help you and your healthcare professional decide whether you should consider measures to reduce your risk of breast cancer.</p>



<p>Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of&nbsp;breast cancer. And an estimated 5% to 10% of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancers are linked to gene mutations</a>&nbsp;passed through generations of a family. It's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer while other people with risk factors do not. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.</p>



<p>Some risk factors, such as family history, can't be changed. However, you can make lifestyle changes, including limiting alcohol, eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active, to lower your risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Mammogram</strong></p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram</a>&nbsp;is an X-ray image of your breasts. It can be used for breast cancer screening and for diagnostic purposes, such as to investigate symptoms or unusual findings on another imaging test.</p>



<p>During a mammogram, your breasts are compressed between two firm surfaces to spread out the breast tissue. Then an X-ray captures black-and-white images that are displayed on a computer screen and examined for signs of cancer.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>3D mammogram</strong></p>



<p>A traditional mammogram creates 2D images of the breast. A newer type of mammogram called a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/3d-mammogram/about/pac-20438708?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3D mammogram</a>, or breast tomosynthesis, creates 3D images of the breast. Many medical facilities offer 3D mammograms in addition to the traditional 2D mammograms for breast cancer screening.</p>



<p>A 3D mammogram is used to look for breast cancer in people who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It also can be used to investigate the cause of breast problems, such as a breast mass, pain and nipple discharge. 3D mammograms also may be recommended for women with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/in-depth/dense-breast-tissue/art-20123968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense breast tissue</a>.</p>



<p>When used for breast cancer screening, the 3D mammogram machine creates 3D images and standard 2D mammogram images because both types of images have some advantages in revealing certain breast abnormalities.</p>

<p><em>Joint development collaboration to bring leading-edge nanopore sequencing into clinical laboratories at Mayo Clinic to increase understanding and improve treatment of cancer and genetic disorders</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn., and OXFORD, UK — Mayo Clinic and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, the company delivering a new generation of nanopore-based molecular sensing technology, today unveiled a multi-year joint development collaboration to develop new clinical tests for diseases and improve patient care.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic and Oxford Nanopore have identified several areas of development, spanning a wide breadth of applications from translational research in human genetics to detection of genetic predisposition to cancer.</p>



<p>“We are proud to work with Mayo Clinic to support the development of new tests that will assist clinical decision-making and improve patient lives. This collaboration shows that Oxford Nanopore’s technology is ready to support development and validation of assays for clinical care, and it underscores our maturity and long-term vision to transform this space. We have long held the ambition to become a utility player in world-renowned, global clinical centers of excellence, and this is our first step toward achieving that vision,” says Gordon Sanghera, CEO, Oxford Nanopore Technologies.</p>



<p>Nanopore sequencing is well positioned to serve Mayo Clinic’s goals of improving testing in some of the hardest-to-characterize conditions. The ability to sequence any-length fragments of DNA — from short to long and ultra-long — and examine methylation in real time offers the potential to provide clinicians with a more complete picture of an evolving cancer genome quickly and accurately. Methylation is particularly important, as this typically requires bisulfite conversions and additional cost yet is key to unmasking crucial insights.</p>



<p>“Pairing Oxford Nanopore’s innovative nanopore sequencing with Mayo Clinic’s world-class clinical and diagnostic testing knowledge further helps advance patient care,” says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/pritt-bobbi-s-m-d/bio-20514068">Bobbi Pritt, M.D.</a>, interim chair of Mayo Clinic’s Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology. “We are excited to collaborate with Oxford Nanopore on this effort to develop new clinical tests that will provide the right answers for patients at the right time.”</p>



<p>The collaboration activities will take place on Mayo Clinic’s campus in Rochester, Minnesota.</p>

<p>Many people enjoy eating soy products like tofu, soy nuts and edamame. Dr. Mussallem says the plant-based protein doesn't increase your chance of developing breast cancer. &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Soy contains plant-based estrogens which don't increase breast cancer risk</h3>



<p>"For years, I've been trying to dispel the myth about soy and breast cancer. And it seems that the message still isn't out because almost every day, every patient I see is worried about consuming soy products," says Dr. Mussallem.</p>



<p>Soy is packed with isoflavones, which is a type of plant estrogen (phytoestrogen) known for its beneficial properties. It has a similar chemical structure to human estrogen, but soy binds to the estrogen receptors on breast tissue differently, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor.</p>



<p>"Soy consumption after a breast cancer diagnosis not only is a great way for you to get a plant-based protein, it also improves your breast cancer outcomes," says Dr. Mussallem.</p>



<p>It is important to avoid ultraprocessed foods, including processed meat, and limit intake of red meat and high-fat dairy. Eating a wide variety of colorful vegetables and fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds can be helpful in preventing and surviving breast cancer.</p>

<p>In August 2021, then-28-year-old Mike Knudson set out on what he thought would be an adventure-filled hiking vacation inside Glacier National Park in Montana. Little did he know at the time that this journey into nature would be the start of an unexpected life path.</p>



<p>It all began innocuously enough just before Mike was scheduled to leave for his trip. One morning before work, he felt a faint tingle course through his body and a peculiar taste fill his mouth as he ate breakfast. The sensations happened again intermittently over the next few weeks and persisted into late August during Mike’s hiking trip. As he trekked more than 20 miles across the mountaintops of Glacier National Park, Mike began to experience symptoms more frequently and severely, which forced him to cut his trip short. When he returned home, he experienced additional symptoms that included chronic fatigue, sensitivity to light, nausea, loss of appetite, and body soreness.</p>



<p>At this point, Mike called in sick from work and went to a local emergency room, where he tested positive for Lyme disease and was given antibiotics. Yet, something still was not right. “I still felt terrible, and I remember telling my friends that if I still felt bad by the upcoming weekend after I finished the antibiotics, I’d go back to the hospital. But I did not make it to the weekend,” Mike says. “That Friday, my legs gave out and I collapsed and passed out in my apartment. My roommates called 911 and got ahold of my family, and I was rushed by ambulance to the nearest ER.” Soon after arriving at a Twin Cities hospital, Mike blacked out. By midnight, he’d regained consciousness and was transferred by helicopter to Mayo Clinic Hospital – Rochester, Saint Marys Campus. “Two thoughts crossed my mind at this point,” Mike says. “‘Whatever I have is very serious,’ and ‘It’s a good thing I’m going to the Mayo Clinic, because if anyone can treat it, it’s them.’”</p>



<p><strong>An unexpected odyssey</strong></p>



<p>When Mike arrived at Saint Marys, Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/parney-ian-f-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ian Parney, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, says testing revealed that his worsening symptoms were being caused by a variant of a grade IV <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioblastoma/cdc-20350148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a> called an isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant astrocytoma. IDH mutant astrocytomas account for approximately 4% of all grade IV primary brain tumors and have a 21- to 30-month survival rate average. “A grade IV IDH mutant astrocytoma is less common than glioblastoma but more common in younger people,”&nbsp;Dr. Parney says.&nbsp;“It’s a malignant brain tumor with a strong tendency to recur in the brain.”</p>



<p>Testing showed that Mike’s tumor had two distinct components. “The first was a very aggressive appearing component that lit up with the contrast dye on his MRI in his left temporal lobe,” Dr. Parney says. “The second was much larger but less aggressive involving his left frontal, temporal and insular lobes.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, clinicians like Dr. Parney would have time to discuss and consider treatment options for brain tumor patients. But given that Mike was “very sick with recurrent seizures and a decreased level of consciousness due to the pressure from the mass inside his head” when he arrived at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Parney knew that wasn’t going to be possible for him.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“HE IS ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF BRAIN TUMOR PATIENTS IN MY CAREER THAT I HAVE TAKEN TO THE OR FOR AN EMERGENCY CRANIOTOMY,” DR. PARNEY SAYS. “WE USUALLY HAVE MORE TIME TO CONSIDER OPTIONS. IN HIS CASE, IT WAS NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE ENHANCING, AGGRESSIVE APPEARING COMPONENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO SAVE HIS LIFE.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Because of the severity of Mike’s symptoms and the swelling in his brain, Dr. Parney made the decision to perform two separate surgeries to remove Mike’s tumor. The first would require Mike to be awake during the procedure so that Dr. Parney and others in the operating suite could mitigate the potential risk that surgery could have on Mike’s motor and speech skills. Mike’s second surgery was even more complex because it carried a risk of significant long-term side effects, such as difficulty speaking or weakness on one side of his body for the rest of his life, paralysis, and even death. Despite these risks, Mike knew he wanted to move forward with the second procedure. To prepare, Dr. Parney worked with colleagues from Mayo Clinic’s Departments of Radiology, Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Neuro-Oncology, Radiation Oncology, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and Speech Pathology to get the best care and treatment plan in place for Mike.</p>



<p>In addition to this inner-specialty collaboration with colleagues across Mayo Clinic, laboratory testing from <a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Laboratories</a> also played a crucial role in establishing Mike’s diagnosis and treatment plan. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/raghunathan-aditya-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20509972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aditya Raghunathan, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, from Mayo Clinic’s Anatomic Pathology Laboratory, reviewed tissue samples from Mike’s tumor during his surgical procedures, which revealed that while Mike’s tumor showed a resemblance to glioblastoma, it possessed distinct features with a more favorable prognosis. Testing also unveiled a potential susceptibility to targeted agents in case of tumor recurrence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A path to healing</strong></h2>



<p>During Mike’s second surgery, staff from Mayo Clinic’s electroencephalogram lab played a critical role in monitoring his speech and motor skills to ensure they were not impacted by the procedure. “Fortunately, the most pain I went through was honestly just from the tightness of the head wrap bandage,” Mike says. “But over the following months, I had some prolonged symptoms. Most occurred because my tumor was next to my speech center. So, while I still understood all the definitions and knew all the words to an extent, I would forget them mid-sentence.”</p>



<p>Another challenge for Mike was reestablishing his appetite after the four months of rapid onset nausea he’d experienced before coming to Mayo Clinic. “I lost 40 pounds and went from being able to walk perfectly fine to hardly being able to walk more than a few blocks,” he says. “For two months, I used crutches or walking sticks just to walk around the block.”</p>



<p>Today, Mike’s continued healing is marked by his resilience and determination. Following his second surgery, he visited a speech therapist for three months. These efforts yielded remarkable improvements in his speech and communication skills, which underscored his unwavering dedication to regaining his quality of life. He’s also met with Michael Ruff, M.D., chair of Mayo Clinic’s Division of Neuro-Oncology, every two months for comprehensive MRIs and updates on his condition.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“EVERY TIME I HAD AN APPOINTMENT, I'D WRITE UP TWO WHOLE SHEETS OF QUESTIONS TO ASK MY DOCTORS AND THEY WOULD ANSWER EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM,” MIKE SAYS. “I DEEPLY APPRECIATED THE RESPONSES TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to his doctors, Mike has leaned on his friends and family for support throughout his recovery. Both of Mike’s parents are Mayo Clinic employees. His dad, Steve, is chair of Contracting and Payer Relations, while his recently retired mom, Terri, served as senior director of Strategy Management Services for Mayo Clinic’s Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology. “Mike is doing incredible,” Terri Knudson says. “I mean, talk about going past the average. And with his youth and his strength, he’ll beat this thing. A lot has happened in 22 months, but Mike’s still living his life to the fullest. He has a pretty long bucket list, and he’s checking them off quickly.”</p>



<p>Since returning home to the Twin Cities, Mike has embraced his fresh perspective on life by rekindling his love for past hobbies while exploring new interests. Notably, he has devoted time to learning two languages, Spanish and Japanese. He also has reignited his love for archery, making chain mail, blacksmithing, leatherworking, playing piano, reading books, and going for 50-mile bike rides. The longest ride he completed recently stretched for 70 miles, a testament to his determination to surpass his own limits.</p>



<p>True to his adventurous spirit, Mike has also revisited his love for travel. During the summer of 2022, he embarked on thrilling quests to the Rocky Mountains with his friends and a memorable voyage to Australia and New Zealand alongside his parents. During these travels, he fulfilled his lifelong dream to hike one of the world’s Seven Summits, Mount Kosciuszko in Australia, and Mount Doom, New Zealand’s largest active volcano, which served as the iconic backdrop for his favorite film series,&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>. While in New Zealand, Mike and his parents also skydived together over Queenstown, a town that some call the adventure capital of the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Envisioning hope</strong></h2>



<p>With an ever-growing bucket list and the encouraging progress of his health, Mike remains steadfast in his belief that he will continue to defy the odds. Having surpassed the two-year milestone of his diagnosis, both Dr. Parney and Dr. Ruff share Mike’s optimism while recognizing the remarkable trajectory of his journey.</p>



<p>“Mike has done really well,” Dr. Parney says. “He went on to enroll in a clinical trial where he received standard treatment with radiation and chemotherapy as well as an experimental immunotherapy. Coincidentally, I happen to be the principal investigator for this clinical trial. His tumor has shrunk even further on his MRI scans and there has been no sign of recurrence even two years after his diagnosis. We are hopeful but will need to remain vigilant.”</p>



<p>Dr. Ruff echoes Dr. Parney’s optimism.</p>



<p>“Mike is doing what I think we all hope we would do after a serious diagnosis of cancer: living his life to the fullest, traveling, even skydiving,” he says. “He benefited from an exceptional set of surgeries, and a compelling clinical trial using immune therapy in addition to the standard of care. In the near future, he may also benefit from groundbreaking advances in our field targeting the IDH mutation, which his tumor harbors and acts as a molecular driver of the disease. This past June, data was published regarding the successful targeting of this mutation in patients with IDH mutant gliomas with a new form of targeted therapy. While we don’t know that all patients will benefit from the use of these targeted agents or the optimal timing the agents should be employed, we have a now new approach with a proven rationale. It fills you with a sense of hope, and it may benefit other patients like Mike.”</p>



<p>With his health on the mend and his outlook increasingly positive, Mike is looking forward to more progress in his medical journey with Mayo Clinic as well as ongoing research that could bring about improved outcomes for other patients. His story serves as a poignant reminder that life’s most invaluable moments should not be delayed but embraced here and now.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“NO MATTER HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE LEFT, LIVE LIFE TO ITS FULLEST,” HE SAYS. “THAT GOES BEYOND PEOPLE WITH THIS CONDITION. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME DELAYING TRIPS SAYING, ‘I'LL DO THAT IN FIVE YEARS. I'LL DO THAT IN 10 YEARS.’ TAKE THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE LEFT TO GO ENJOY THE LIFE THAT YOU HAVE LEFT WITH ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO TRY. AND LISTEN TO WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ultrasound/about/pac-20395177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrasound</a>&nbsp;— a technology that uses sound waves to produce an image — is commonly used to monitor the development of a baby as it grows inside its mother. But ultrasound imaging also can be used to investigate suspicious masses of tissue and nodules that may be cancerous.</p>



<p>Tumors consist not only of cancer cells but also a matrix of small blood vessels, or microvessels, that cannot be seen in the images produced by conventional ultrasound machines. To solve this problem, physician-scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/alizad-azra-m-d/bio-00085586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azra Alizad, M.D.</a>, and biomedical engineering scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fatemi-mostafa-ph-d/bio-00086282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostafa Fatemi, Ph.D.</a>, teamed up at Mayo Clinic to design and study a tool that may improve the resolution of ultrasound imaging. As demonstrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, they developed high-resolution ultrasound imaging software, compatible with many ultrasound machines, that could exponentially improve both the detail and quality of images.</p>



<p>The investigational software, which they've named quantitative high-definition microvessel imaging (q-HDMI), has been evaluated to capture high-resolution 2D and 3D images of microvessels as small as 150 microns, roughly twice the width of a human hair.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 35%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>"If we can visualize and capture the microvessel in the earliest stages of cancer, we can better diagnose and treat it earlier, which improves the outcome for the patient," says Dr. Alizad, who specializes in ultrasound technology for cancer imaging.</p>
</div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="925" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-375671 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1.jpg 925w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1-271x300.jpg 271w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1-768x850.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artificial intelligence helps detect what we cannot see</strong></h2>



<p>In addition, the researchers identified a series of biomarkers representing specific characteristics of tiny </p>



<p>vessels, such as shape, pattern, irregularity and complexity, and packaged them into an algorithm that can sort the image data into benign or malignant masses.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:37% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="481" height="532" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-375670 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical.jpg 481w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical-271x300.jpg 271w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p></p>



<p>"This technology provides a quantitative value that shows the probability of malignancy," Dr. Fatemi says. "It's a tool to extract information in a way that can be useful to clinicians."</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applying it in practice</strong></h2>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-022-01583-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical study</a>, the researchers showed that their new q-HDMI tool combined with artificial intelligence (AI) was able to detect a very small, 3-millimeter-wide, malignant breast cancer mass comprised of miniscule vessels in a 40-year-old woman. Finding and treating cancer lesions when they are this size before they spread, or metastasize, can be lifesaving.</p>



<p>"The questions in radiology really are: benign or malignant? And if it's suspicious, how concerned should we be?" Dr. Fatemi says.</p>



<p>To help radiologists answer these questions, the researchers applied their software and algorithm to further analyze suspicious breast masses from 521 patients who already had received conventional ultrasound imaging. The results were astounding. The new technology yielded a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 100% rate of accuracy</a>&nbsp;in determining malignant versus benign masses, regardless of the tumor size.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="fluidEmbed"><iframe loading="lazy" id="videoidqCtLfFbWcEoampt"  title="3D images of benign and malignant breast tissue masses" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCtLfFbWcEo?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>More recently, the researchers analyzed thyroid nodules from 92 patients. Thyroid nodules are common and it is often hard to differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous ones through imaging. Yet the prevalence of thyroid cancer has increased over the last few decades.</p>



<p>"With conventional ultrasound images, physicians can diagnose whether a thyroid nodule is benign or malignant with only about 35-75% accuracy," Dr. Alizad says. That's why physicians often opt to perform thyroid biopsies, which enable them to more definitively determine if a thyroid nodule is a cause for concern.</p>



<p>The researchers identified 12 biomarkers that can differentiate benign from malignant thyroid tissues. They programmed the AI-powered algorithm with these biomarkers, which sorted the images and had an 84% rate of accuracy. These results were published in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36980774/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancers</a>&nbsp;and highlighted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/news-events/newsroom/how-combination-advanced-ultrasound-and-ai-could-upgrade-cancer-diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>



<p>"If it is cancer, we definitely want to know that. But if we can determine if a thyroid nodule is benign without even having to do a biopsy, that is even better as it spares the patient from the financial and physical burdens associated with an unnecessary benign biopsy," Dr. Alizad says.</p>



<p>The researchers see that their quantitative tool could be particularly useful in parts of the world where there is limited expertise and resources, such as rural areas and developing countries.</p>



<p>They also are collaborating with oncologists to enable them to use the q-HDMI tool to better monitor the effectiveness of cancer treatments and help them adjust therapies for individual patients in real time.</p>

<p>October is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aacr.org/patients-caregivers/awareness-months/liver-cancer-awareness-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liver Cancer Awareness Month</a>, which makes this<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>a good time to learn more about risk factors for liver cancer and what you can do to prevent it.</p>



<p>More than 41,000 new cases of primary liver cancer and intrahepatic bile duct cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year, and nearly 30,000 people will die of these diseases, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/liver-cancer/about/what-is-key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liver cancer</a>&nbsp;is cancer that begins in the cells of your liver, which is a football-sized organ in the upper right portion of your abdomen. The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intrahepatic bile duct cancer</a>, which sometimes is classified as a type of liver cancer, occurs in the parts of the bile ducts within the liver. Bile ducts carry bile, a digestive fluid, and they connect your liver to your gallbladder and small intestine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2>



<p>Factors that increase the risk of primary liver cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chronic infection with HBV or HCV.</strong><br>Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) increases your risk of liver cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Cirrhosis.</strong><br>This progressive and irreversible condition causes scar tissue to form in your liver and increases your chances of developing liver cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Certain inherited liver diseases.</strong><br>Liver diseases that can increase the risk of liver cancer include hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease.</li>



<li><strong>Diabetes.</strong><br>People with this blood sugar disorder have a greater risk of liver cancer than those who don't have diabetes.</li>



<li><strong>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</strong><br>An accumulation of fat in the liver increases the risk of liver cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Exposure to aflatoxins.</strong><br>Aflatoxins are poisons produced by molds that grow on crops that are stored poorly. Grains and nuts can become contaminated with aflatoxins and end up in foods made of these products.</li>



<li><strong>Excessive alcohol consumption.</strong><br>Consuming more than a moderate amount of alcohol daily over many years can lead to irreversible liver damage and increase your risk of liver cancer.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>



<p>Strategies for preventing liver cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce your risk of cirrhosis.</strong><br>Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver, and it increases the risk of liver cancer. You can reduce your risk of cirrhosis if you drink alcohol in moderation, if at all, and maintain a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Get vaccinated against hepatitis B.</strong><br>You can reduce your risk of hepatitis B by receiving the hepatitis B vaccine. The vaccine can be given to almost anyone, including infants, older adults and those with compromised immune systems.</li>



<li><strong>Take measures to prevent hepatitis C.</strong><br>No vaccine for hepatitis C exists, but you can reduce your risk of infection by taking care to avoid unprotected sex with a partner infected with&nbsp;HBV,&nbsp;HCV&nbsp;or any other sexually transmitted infection. Don't inject illegal drugs. If you do, make sure any needle you use is sterile and don't share it. And  before getting a piercing or tattoo, check out the shops in your area and ask staff members about their safety practices. Needles that are not properly sterilized can spread the hepatitis C virus.</li>



<li><strong>Seek treatment for hepatitis B or hepatitis C.</strong><br>Treatments are available for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections. Research shows that treatment can reduce the risk of liver cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Ask your healthcare professional about liver cancer screening.</strong><br>For the general population, screening for liver cancer hasn't been proved to reduce the risk of dying of liver cancer, and it isn't generally recommended. People with conditions that increase the risk of liver cancer, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and liver cirrhosis, might consider screening. Discuss the pros and cons of screening with your healthcare team. Together you can decide whether screening is right for you based on your risk. Screening typically involves a blood test and an abdominal ultrasound exam every six months.</li>

<p>In a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajh.27086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers examined telomere biology disorders, a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by short telomeres. Telomeres are long segments at the end of chromosomes that protect the DNA from unraveling, similar to the small plastic sheath at the end of a shoelace. Telomeres shorten naturally with age but become abnormally shorter in telomere biology disorders. People with these disorders often have bone marrow failure and, for unknown reasons, a high risk of developing blood cancer.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers explored the causes of this increased cancer risk by assessing clonal hematopoiesis in patients with telomere biology disorders. Clonal hematopoiesis is also an age-related event that occurs when blood stem cells acquire genetic mutations that make them divide more rapidly than normal. This creates a growing clone in the blood that can evolve into blood cancer. Approximately 10-20% of the population over 70 present an observable clonal hematopoiesis. However, how these clones evolve over time depends on the gene mutation acquired and the surrounding environment of the cells.</p>



<p>The study found that people with telomere biology disorders often have a high percentage of clonal hematopoiesis. Variants in the&nbsp;<em>U2AF1</em>&nbsp;gene are especially common. In contrast, clonal hematopoiesis that occurs because of aging is associated with other mutated genes. This difference suggests that the&nbsp;<em>U2AF1</em>&nbsp;gene may play a role in developing blood cancer, specifically in people with telomere biology disorders.</p>

<p>"<em>U2AF1</em>&nbsp;mutations can affect the expression of specific genes and contribute to the emergence of clonal hematopoiesis in a way that is unique to these patients," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ferrer-alejandro-ph-d/bio-20503546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic hematology researcher. "We need to understand why this gene is so commonly mutated in people with this disorder and its role in cancer development."</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>The findings are especially relevant for people with telomere biology disorders who may be sensitive to standard cancer therapies due to a combination of factors, including preexisting genomic instability, shortened telomeres and the potential effect of these therapies on cancer and healthy cells.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future Research</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers need to better understand why the&nbsp;<em>U2AF1&nbsp;</em>gene is prominently mutated in people with telomere biology disorders compared to other genes. Assessing the clinical relevance may help advance knowledge and potentially develop targeted treatments tailored to their needs.</p>

<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."</p>



<p>Dr Qin's team developed a cell therapy to target a protein known as B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) found in patients with B-cell cancers, particularly those with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a>. The BAFF-R protein is linked to tumor growth. The cell therapy under investigation allows the immune system to quash cancer and target tumors that have returned or have resisted available CAR-T cell therapies.</p>



<p>"Our team developed a method to isolate T cells and tumor cells from blood samples of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We generated BAFF-R targeting CAR-T cells from the individual samples and then demonstrated in the lab that these genetically modified cells could kill tumors using the patients' own cells," says Dr. Qin.</p>



<p>The results of this early research lay the foundation for an important milestone: Mayo Clinic will biomanufacture this experimental CAR-T cell therapy at its campus in Florida. The research team will advance the CAR-T cells to a phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and define the treatment dose in humans.</p>



<p>Depending on the results of the phase 1 clinical trial, it could take 5-7 years for this therapy to become available to patients in the clinic.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic in Florida <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hematology-oncology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, supports delivering new cell therapies to patients with complex medical conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transforming cancer care</strong></h2>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy is a regenerative immunotherapy that seeks to unlock the power of the body's immune system to attack cancer. Patients' T-cells are separated from their blood, genetically modified, mass produced and then returned to their bodies to kill cancer.</p>



<p>The experimental therapies have delivered transformative results — &nbsp;in some cases putting B-cell lymphomas and leukemias into remission. However, leukemia and lymphoma tumors can change over time and become resistant to therapies, resulting in a return or relapse of cancer. 40% of patients have had cancer return within two years of undergoing CAR-T cell therapy. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Biomanufacturing on-site</strong></h2>



<p>This BAFF-R targeting technology is the first CAR-T cell therapy to both be developed at Mayo Clinic and biomanufactured on-site. The advantages to biomanufacturing in-house are the ability to adjust doses, individualize treatments and more quickly deliver the cells back to the patient.</p>

<p>"The cornerstone of Mayo's biomanufacturing strategy is accelerating promising new medicines from human sources such as cells to patient care. Biomanufacturing CAR-T cells is a high priority because of the potential to provide healing for patients with few or no other solutions," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, The Michael S. and Mary Sue Shannon Director of the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "We are very excited to reach this landmark of biomanufacturing the first CAR-T cell therapy developed by Mayo Clinic research." Dr. Allickson is also the Otto Bremer Trust Director, Biomanufacturing and Product Development, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is expanding its biomanufacturing facilities on all three campuses to quickly move cell therapies from the lab to early-stage clinical trials. From there, Mayo hopes to collaborate with industry to bring new regenerative immunotherapies to routine clinical care for the benefit of patients around the world.</p>

<p>It's common to experience breast changes during perimenopause or menopause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We sometimes have shoots in our estrogen levels, so that can cause some breast tenderness. Typically, our density in the breast tends to decrease a little bit with menopause because we lose estrogen," says Dr. Faubion.</p>



<p>She says some age-related breast changes are normal, and ongoing breast care is vital.</p>



<p>"It's important to remember when you're in menopause to continue with breast cancer screening just as when you were premenopausal," Dr. Faubion says.</p>



<p>It's recommended to start regular breast cancer screening at age 40.</p>



<p>"We recommend mammography every year. There are also women with increased breast density, and we recommend supplemental screening for those women," she says.</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain a healthy weight.</li>



<li>Get regular exercise.</li>



<li>Limit alcohol consumption.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Algorithm seeks to address 'last-mile' barrier by identifying disease when cure still possible</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&nbsp;Estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. by 2030, pancreatic cancer has a grim prognosis with nearly 70% of patients facing mortality within the first year of diagnosis. Unfortunately, 40% of small pancreatic cancers elude detection on CT scans until they've advanced to an incurable stage.</p>



<p>This creates a critical "last-mile" barrier for early detection efforts where, in most patients — including those high-risk subjects undergoing active screening — imaging detects the cancer at a stage when a cure is unlikely. This makes imaging the final frontier in the quest for early cancer detection.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(23)04958-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent breakthrough</a>, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers used the world's most extensive imaging dataset to build a versatile artificial intelligence (AI) model that has shown the potential for autonomous detection of pancreatic cancer on standard CTs when surgical intervention can still promise a cure.</p>



<p>"This is where the study emerges as a beacon of hope," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/goenka-ajit-h-m-d/bio-20152402?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ajit H. Goenka, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiologist and principal investigator and corresponding author. "It addresses the last-mile challenge — detecting the cancer at a stage when the cancer is even beyond the scope of experts."</p>



<p>The group developed a highly accurate AI model, trained on the largest — more than 3,000 patients — and most diverse CT dataset, for fully automated cancer detection, including small and otherwise difficult-to-detect tumors. Published in <a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gastroenterology</a>, the journal of the American Gastroenterological Association, the study not only builds on the group's recent work on <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ai-applied-to-prediagnostic-cts-may-help-diagnose-pancreatic-cancer-at-earlier-more-treatable-stage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiomics-based early detection models</a> but also underscores Mayo Clinic's standing as a beacon of innovation in AI healthcare solutions.</p>

<p>Most important, the model could detect visually imperceptible cancer from normal-appearing pancreases on prediagnostic CT images (i.e., those acquired at three to 36 months prior to clinical diagnosis) substantially early — a median of 438 days — before clinical diagnosis.</p>



<p>"These findings suggest that AI has the potential to detect hidden cancers in asymptomatic individuals, allowing for surgical treatment at a stage when a cure is still achievable," Dr. Goenka says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the model remained reliable and accurate across diverse patient groups and variations in scanning equipment and imaging techniques. This resilience is crucial for the model's utility in a wide array of real-world medical scenarios.</p>



<p>Addressing a major concern in the AI healthcare landscape, the team also deconstructed the AI's decision-making process to ensure transparency, acknowledging that trust and quality control are essential for AI's broader clinical acceptance.</p>



<p>"We owe the progress to the ingenious efforts of the Framework for AI Software Technology, or FAST, team led by Panagiotis Korfiatis, Ph.D., complemented by our team of exceptionally bright research fellows and data science analysts," says Dr. Goenka. "They dedicated months to meticulous preparation for our initial submission and invested significant effort to astutely address the incisive queries of the panel of international reviewers."</p>



<p>"We're only at the beginning but stand ready to address the challenges of early cancer detection, leveraging the capabilities of AI and next-generation molecular imaging in conjunction with complementary biomarkers," he adds.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has already initiated the steps for clinical validation and the models are undergoing regulatory processes. With backing from the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, the team is set to undertake benefactor-funded prospective screening trials. The insights from these trials will refine and bolster the practical effectiveness of their innovative approach.</p>
