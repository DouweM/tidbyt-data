<p><em>Editor's note: March 4 is World HPV Awareness Day</em></p>



<p>There are more than 100 strains of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV</a>. Some types of the virus can cause cancer. HPV 16 has been linked to the rising cases of oropharyngeal cancer, commonly known as throat cancer.&nbsp;It is the most common&nbsp;HPV-associated cancer in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/expert-answers/hpv/faq-20057761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">men</a>, and the rate of infection continues to increase.<em> </em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/price-katharine-a-m-d/bio-20054955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Katharine Price</a>, a medical oncologist with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, says that while <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hpv-infection-may-cause-throat-mouth-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV-related throat cancer</a> is often curable, prevention is best.</p>

<p>Oropharyngeal&nbsp;cancers are the most common HPV-related cancers, and they occur more frequently in men. About 60% to 70% of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/symptoms-causes/syc-20354171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head and neck cancers </a>are linked to the virus.  Dr. Price explains where it often develops.</p>



<p>"Largely in the oropharynx — this part of the throat that is at the tonsil and then circling around to the back of the tongue, and it's where all of this lymphoid-rich tissue lives," she says.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing throat cancer</h3>



<p>These cancers are treatable, but prevention is always better, starting with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/in-depth/hpv-vaccine/art-20047292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV vaccine</a>.</p>



<p>"It's a vaccine that is recommended for all boys and girls, at age 11 and 12. That's when it's on the routine recommendation list for vaccines, although you can actually give it as early as 9," Dr. Price says.</p>



<p>The vaccine is available to people through age 45.<br><br>"It's much better to get a vaccine that's safe, that has no long-term side effects or complications than to have to go through surgery, radiation, chemotherapy," says Dr. Price.</p>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/schedules-recommendations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more</a>&nbsp;information on the vaccine dosage and schedule for children and adults.</p>



<p>Along with vaccination, you can reduce risks by avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HPV infection is often symptomless and can lead to cancers of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20352509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervix</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vagina</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vulvar-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20368051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vulva</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/mens-health/in-depth/penis-health/art-20046175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">penis</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anus</a> as well as the throat.</h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fighting cancer with the spirit of a warrior and a smile</strong></h2>



<p>No matter what life throws at her, Evelyn's parents say she just keeps on smiling. "That's how she looks 99% of the time even if she doesn't feel good," says her mom, Claire Owens. Evelyn's dad agrees. "She's very, very tough," says Austin Owens.</p>



<p>Evelyn's toughness was put to the test when pathology results revealed she had cancer. </p>



<p>"Everybody thought it was a cyst," recalls Claire. "Even after surgery they said it was a cyst, and then the pathology came back as cancer."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="536" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912-536x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-382619" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912-536x1024.jpg 536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912-157x300.jpg 157w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912-768x1466.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912-805x1536.jpg 805w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912.jpg 967w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Evelyn was six-years-old when she was diagnosed with cancer         Photo courtesy: Owens family</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is rhabdomyosarcoma?</strong></h2>



<p>Additional tests showed the cancer was <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rhabdomyosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20390962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rhabdomyosarcoma</a>. </strong>RMS begins as a growth of cells in soft tissue, like muscle. It can start anywhere in the body. RMS most often occurs in children younger than the age of ten. Symptoms depend on where the cancer starts and can include lumps under the skin, redness, swelling, and pain. </p>



<p>As part of her treatment, Evelyn's doctors recommended radiation with innovative cancer-fighting technology called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488"><strong>proton </strong></a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>beam</strong></a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488"><strong> therapy</strong></a>. Her family traveled from their home in Oregon to <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491">Mayo Clinic</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491">in Arizona</a> </strong>so Evelyn could receive the cutting-edge therapy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fighting cancer with proton beam therapy</strong></h2>



<p>"Proton therapy allows us to treat the area we need to treat completely while protecting many of the normal tissues nearby," says radiation oncologist, <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ahmed-safia-k-m-d/bio-20433784">Dr. Safia Ahmed.</a></strong> "And for pediatric patients that's very important because all of their tissues are growing."</p>

"And by minimizing radiation dose and radiation dose side effects to these tissues as they are growing is key. It improves their (patients) quality of life," says Dr. Ahmed.</p>



<p>Evelyn underwent 24 treatments of proton beam therapy over six weeks. Her parents say through it all, she stayed tough and positive. </p>



<p>"I can't imagine going through this with anybody else but you," says Austin about his daughter. "You should be the poster child for going through cancer and cancer treatments. I'm so proud of you and love you so much," he adds.</p>

<p>Evelyn is now 7 years old and back home in Oregon with her family. She will still require some <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-5-advances-in-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>chemotherapy treatment</strong></a>. Doctors say her prognosis looks good. Evelyn will undergo regular monitoring to make sure the cancer does not come back.</p>



<p>These days Evelyn is back to enjoying the things she loves most, like riding ponies with her brother, Henry, and taking her dog, Duke, on walks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>"Evelyn, you are going to do big things"</strong></p><cite>Claire Owens, Evelyn's mom</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>What do tobacco, alcohol and obesity have in common? They can all increase your risk of developing cancer. Smoked tobacco is strongly linked to cancer in almost every part of the body.</p>



<p>"Smoked tobacco produces about 7,000 chemicals, and when you inhale those chemicals in your body, they cause alterations in cells. And it's those alterations in cells that can lead to cancer," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>He says smoking also weakens your immune system, making it harder to fight cancer cells. One of the best ways to lower your cancer risk is to not use any kind of tobacco.</p>



<p>"We always say it's never too late to stop smoking. And the risk for cancer after quitting cigarette smoking, for example, goes down. But it takes some time," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Consuming alcohol increases your risk of breast, head and neck, esophageal, and colorectal cancers.</p>



<p>"At every level of alcohol consumption, there is cancer risk, but heavier drinkers have higher cancer risk than lighter drinkers," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Finally, packing on extra pounds can increase your risk of cancer in several ways.</p>



<p>"Excess body weight increases estrogen and insulin, which can increase the rate of cellular division, which can increase the risk for cancer. But also, excess body weight is associated with inflammation, and inflammation is a known risk factor for the development of cancer," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Bariatric surgery has been shown to decrease risk of hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrial and prostate, as well as pancreatic and colorectal cancers. However, there are less drastic steps people can take.</p>



<p>"Small sustainable steps toward weight loss are the most effective when we think about diet and exercise. Those are the classic approaches, but also there are new medications on the market that can help people lose weight," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>

<p>Gynecologic cancers target the female reproductive system. This includes cancer of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovaries</a>, fallopian tubes, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uterus</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervix</a>, vulva and vagina. About 100,000 women are diagnosed yearly. However, outcomes are different for minority women.</p>



<p>"We do see, unfortunately, elevated mortality rates in Black and Hispanic women in gynecologic cancer," says Dr. Butler.</p>

<p>She says there are several socioeconomic factors that play a role in gynecologic cancer disparities. Obesity, diabetes and hypertension also contribute to cancer risks.</p>



<p>"I think that the healthcare disparities involve comorbidities of these patients, access for these patients, transportation," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>She says finding a healthcare professional you're comfortable with, getting vaccinated against HPV, and undergoing regular pelvic exams and/or Pap tests are crucial.</p>



<p>"This is tremendously important because catching and screening these abnormalities and cancers early improves long-term outcomes for women," explains Dr. Butler.</p>



<p><strong>Gynecologic cancer symptoms</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Vaginal bleeding.</li>



<li>Abnormal discharge.</li>



<li>Pelvic pain or pressure is common for ovarian and uterine cancers.</li>



<li>Itching, burning, pain, or tenderness of the vulva.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tammy LeDoux could never have imagined she had a tumor the size of a pineapple growing on her left ovary. Or that precancerous polyps were lurking in her stomach and colon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I never had any cramping. I never had any pain. I never felt anything hard or lumpy in my abdomen or down in my pelvic area. I never knew anything was there," says Tammy, an information technology analyst who lives in Wisconsin.</p>



<p>The surprising discoveries came after Tammy underwent genetic screening via the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, which revealed she has <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome.</a> The disorder is associated with an 80% risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a> and 50% risk of uterine and endometrial cancer.</p>



<p>"I honestly feel like knowing these genetic results has saved my life," Tammy says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tammy's experience mirrors that of many other patients who, prior to participating in the Center’s DNA sequencing research study, called Tapestry, were unaware of their disease risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, nearly 1.3 million Mayo Clinic patients like Tammy were invited to join Tapestry, which screened for three hereditary conditions: familial hypercholesterolemia (hereditary high cholesterol), hereditary breast and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a> (BRCA1 and BRCA2), and Lynch syndrome. Of those, roughly 100,000 chose to participate.</p>



<p>Based on existing literature, the study anticipated nearly 2% of participants would receive a positive result.</p>



<p>"What keeps me up at night is the fact that 1.2 million patients chose <em>not</em> to participate in the study, and this means around 20,000 of them likely have an undiagnosed hereditary risk or condition when considering the 2 percent rate of a positive result," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Konstantinos Lazaridis,</a> the Carlson and Nelson Endowed Executive Director for Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine.</p>



<p>"We need to do better job of educating people about the value of genetic screening for rare but preventable conditions," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Lazaridis says Mayo Clinic is advancing the idea of bringing genetic screening to routine patient care to help identify patients at high risk for cancer and other diseases, enabling earlier screening and mitigating the risk of cancer, the need to use expensive and limited therapies for advanced disease, and reducing premature deaths.</p>



<p>Beyond disease prevention, Mayo Clinic researchers are investigating volumes of Tapestry data to drive forward medical discoveries that enhance novel diagnostics and treatments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Launching the Mayo Clinic Early Onset and Hereditary GI Cancers Program</strong></h2>



<p>In tandem with these efforts, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/samadder-niloy-jewel-m-d/bio-20396993">Dr. Niloy Jewel Samadder</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wu-christina-s-m-b-b-ch-m-d/bio-20529971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Christina Wu,</a> physician scientists in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, launched a new program in February 2024 to address the significant rise of colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers in young people.</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic Early Onset and Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancers Program is dedicated to patients under the age of 55 who are diagnosed with colorectal, gastric, esophageal, liver, bile duct or pancreatic cancer.</p>



<p>This patient-centric program creates an integrated network of services involving gastroenterology, gynecology, oncology, colorectal surgery, infertility, pathology, genetics and adolescent and young adult specialists.</p>



<p>In 2022, Mayo Clinic's three campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota reported over 2,000 newly diagnosed cases of gastrointestinal cancers among people under the age of 55. The marked rise in young-onset colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers underscores a pressing health issue. The new program aims to provide accelerated access to top-tier care.</p>



<p>Dr. Samadder emphasizes that encircling patients with a multidisciplinary team of specialists will help provide the best possible outcomes.</p>



<p>"Our goal is to put the patient at the center of a collaborative framework of experts from diverse fields working seamlessly together," says Dr. Samadder, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and cancer geneticist.</p>



<p>"The program also incorporates translational discoveries such as immunology and cancer evolution, as well as a clinical trial menu, research initiatives and a multi-omics approach that connects to a patient's unique biological datasets,” Dr. Samadder says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tammy’s journey to the Tapestry study</strong></h2>



<p>Tammy’s initial motivation to participate in the Tapestry DNA research study was her curiosity about her ancestral heritage — another aspect of the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon receiving her genetic screening results, Tammy's team of genetic counselors and physicians moved quickly to educate her on Lynch Syndrome and help her schedule various screenings, including a colonoscopy, urine biopsy and ultrasound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These screenings uncovered 10 polyps in her colon and stomach, some with precancerous characteristics, and two concerning moles on her skin. Soon after, Tammy made the proactive decision to undergo a hysterectomy to reduce her cancer risk. It was during this procedure that surgeons discovered and removed the sizable benign tumor.</p>



<p>"I couldn’t believe it. I’m beyond grateful," Tammy says. "I've been through the ringer, but now I have peace of mind knowing I've reduced my risks for cancer, and I can go in every couple years to check for any new polyps."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is dedicated to shaping a future where cancers and other diseases can be prevented altogether, or identified at earlier stages, allowing for more precise treatment by a collaborative team of specialists.</p>

<p></p>



<p>More than 26,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with stomach cancer this year, and nearly 11,000 people will die of the disease, according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/stomach-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. Stomach cancer accounts for about 1.5% of all new cancers diagnosed in the U.S. each year.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stomach-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352438?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stomach cancer</a>, also known as gastric cancer, can affect any part of the stomach.&nbsp;In most of the world, stomach cancers form in the main part of the stomach. In the U.S., stomach cancer is more likely to affect the area where the esophagus meets the stomach. Where the cancer occurs in the stomach is one factor health care professionals consider when determining treatment options.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Trouble swallowing.</li>



<li>Belly pain.</li>



<li>Feeling bloated after eating.</li>



<li>Feeling full after eating small amounts of food.</li>



<li>Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry.</li>



<li>Heartburn.</li>



<li>Indigestion.</li>



<li>Nausea.</li>



<li>Vomiting.</li>



<li>Unintentional weight loss.</li>



<li>Fatigue.</li>



<li>Black stools.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>If you've been diagnosed with stomach cancer, your&nbsp;health care professional will consider the stage and location of your cancer, as well as your overall health and personal preferences, to determine your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stomach-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352443?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a>&nbsp;plan. </p>



<p>Treatment can include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Surgery.</strong><br>The goal of surgery for stomach cancer is to remove all of the cancer. For small stomach cancers, surgery might be the first treatment. Other treatments might be used first if the stomach cancer grows deeper into the stomach wall or spreads to the lymph nodes.</li>



<li><strong>Chemotherapy.</strong><br>Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy often is used before surgery to treat stage 2 and stage 3 stomach cancers. Systemic chemotherapy can shrink the cancer so that it's easier to remove. Systemic chemotherapy may be used after surgery if there's a risk that some cancer cells were left behind. If surgery isn't an option, systemic chemotherapy may be recommended instead. It can be used if the cancer is too advanced or if you're not healthy enough to have surgery. Chemotherapy also can help control cancer symptoms.</li>



<li><strong>Radiation therapy.</strong><br>Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy to kill cancer cells. The beams can come from X-rays, protons or other sources. Radiation sometimes is used before surgery to treat stage 2 and stage 3 stomach cancers. It can shrink the cancer so that it's easier to remove. Radiation therapy may be used after surgery if the cancer can't be removed completely. Radiation can help relieve stomach cancer symptoms if the cancer is advanced or surgery isn't possible.</li>



<li><strong>Targeted therapy.</strong><br>Targeted treatments use medicines that attack specific chemicals present within cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your cancer cells are tested to see if targeted therapy is likely to work for you. Targeted therapy typically is used for advanced stomach cancer. This may include stage 4 stomach cancer and cancer that comes back after treatment.</li>



<li><strong>Immunotherapy.</strong><br>Immunotherapy is a treatment with medicine that helps your body's immune system kill cancer cells. Your immune system fights off diseases by attacking germs and other cells that shouldn't be in your body. Cancer cells survive by hiding from the immune system. Immunotherapy helps the immune system cells find and kill the cancer cells. Immunotherapy sometimes is used to treat advanced cancer. This may include stage 4 stomach cancer or cancer that comes back after treatment.</li>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Bold-Rick-J._30304260_20231002-819x1024-1-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-381394" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Bold-Rick-J._30304260_20231002-819x1024-1-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Bold-Rick-J._30304260_20231002-819x1024-1-768x960.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Bold-Rick-J._30304260_20231002-819x1024-1.jpg 819w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></figure></div>


<p>The factors that create this gap include income, education and geographical location barriers. Discrimination based on ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability and lifestyle can also be a barrier. Some people are also more likely to be exposed to factors that increase cancer risk, such as environmental hazards, unhealthy diet and tobacco.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic joins the UICC in breaking down barriers that stand in the way of cancer care. In this Q&amp;A,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/richard-bold-m-d-named-site-director-mayo-clinic-comprehensive-cancer-center-in-arizona/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rick Bold, M.D.</a>, site deputy director for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;in Arizona, discusses Mayo Clinic's commitment to closing the cancer care gap:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does World Cancer Day mean to Mayo Clinic?</h2>



<p>It means understanding the gaps in our cancer care and our cancer outcomes. It means recognizing those gaps by intentionally trying to close and eliminate them. There are different ways to define the gap; it may be related to the incidence of cancer, it may be related to the outcomes of cancer, and it may be related to access to cancer care. Each of these is a different gap that affects how people cope with cancer, how people survive cancer, and how people are diagnosed with cancer. We should strive to close and eliminate each of these gaps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Mayo Clinic doing to help close the cancer care gap?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer</a> is not just one disease. For example, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> is different for each person. Understanding why breast cancer developed at an individualized level — personalized or precision medicine — helps us determine the proper treatment for that patient and leads to better outcomes. Maybe a woman's genes caused cancer to develop. Perhaps it's where she lived — her environmental history or what she ate. We're doing <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/search-results?studySiteStatusesGrouped=Open/Status%20Unknown&amp;pocId=CON-20167633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> reaching out to women across different communities, ethnic backgrounds and age groups to understand how <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-cancer-risk-assessment/about/pac-20393195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer risk</a> is determined. If every person is different, we need to understand that their cancer is different based on who they are. That's one effort that's helping to close the cancer care gap.</p>



<p>Another effort to close the gap is improving access to screening. Cancer screening is one of the most effective tools to reduce the burden of cancer in our communities. However, only some people have access to screening. Mayo Clinic is asking: How can we help everyone get access? How can we make screening easier? For example, can we detect&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colon cancer</a>&nbsp;with a blood test instead of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopy</a>? Can we detect it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/fecal-occult-blood-test/multimedia/fecal-occult-blood-test-kit/img-20007541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a stool sample</a>&nbsp;collected in a person's home without time away from work or family or disrupting intestinal function by drinking a solution to cleanse the colon for a colonoscopy? Mayo Clinic is researching cancer screening tools that can be made available to more people conveniently at a lower cost. These efforts can help us close the gap by detecting more cancers at their earliest stage, which is when cures happen.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is also using technology to close the gap. One example of this is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proton beam therapy</a>&nbsp;for radiation. Mayo Clinic has two proton therapy units, one in Scottsdale, Arizona, and one in Rochester, Minnesota. We've studied how to deliver proton beam therapy in a way that improves patient outcomes. Some people can't take the time to get radiation, which may last weeks or months. Using proton beam therapy, we can shorten treatment time, broadening access by making it more convenient for people to get treatment in a minimally disruptive way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Mayo Clinic doing to reach out to underserved and rural communities facing cancer care barriers?</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic is developing cancer screening techniques that can be implemented internationally while recognizing that even in the U.S., not everybody has a hospital or a cancer center nearby. Many people are geographically isolated from healthcare or may lack insurance that pays for screening. We're trying to identify methods that could detect a variety of cancers early in a patient-friendly fashion, no matter what environment a person is living in and no matter what resources they have.</p>



<p>All Mayo Clinic locations see themselves as serving the community around them. We are developing strategic partnerships and relationships to elevate access to care in those communities and share our clinical expertise. This moves our care beyond the walls of our hospitals and clinics. Moving cancer care into patients' homes is becoming a national concept. We're starting to delve into that model of care. This will expand our ability to serve a broader population, not just in our local communities but nationally or internationally.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Mayo Clinic's goal for the future of cancer care?</h2>



<p>The ideal goal would be to eliminate cancer or turn cancer into a disease nobody needs to worry about. That's a long-term goal, and maybe we will get there.</p>



<p>In the shorter term, the goal is to achieve equitable cancer care that provides the best outcomes in a way that doesn't significantly disrupt the lives of patients and their families while respecting their individuality and their role in decision-making. We want to put all those things together and then always keep working on improving outcomes.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is committed to eliminating care gaps so every patient, regardless of where they live or who they are, receives the same cancer care and experiences the same positive outcomes. Mayo Clinic is here to serve patients. That's our primary mission.</p>

<p>Early detection and the right treatment are among the best weapons to fight cancer.</p>



<p>However, today many people don't have equitable access to cancer care because of systemic barriers and health disparities.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is working to change that with strategic initiatives aimed at health equity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are health disparities?</h2>



<p><a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/health-equity-healthy-people-2030">The U.S.&nbsp;</a><a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/health-equity-healthy-people-2030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department</a><a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/health-equity-healthy-people-2030">&nbsp;of&nbsp;</a><a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/health-equity-healthy-people-2030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Health</a><a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/health-equity-healthy-people-2030">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</a><a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/health-equity-healthy-people-2030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human</a><a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/health-equity-healthy-people-2030">&nbsp;Services</a>&nbsp;defines health disparities as "a particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage."</p>



<p>According to the agency, health disparities also "adversely affect groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial or ethnic group, religion, socioeconomic status, gender, age, mental health, cognitive, sensory or physical disability, sexual orientation or gender identity, geographic location, or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion."</p>

<p>"Native American Indians, African American patients, Hispanic patients — there are differences that can impact health outcomes," says Dr. Bold. "We have a commitment to eliminate those differences across groups so that every patient, regardless where they live or who they are, have the same anticipated outcome from cancer."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"<strong>We are here to serve patients. That's our primary mission.<br>We are committed to the elimination of inequality in all aspects of cancer care</strong>."</p><cite>Rick Bold, M.D.<br>Mayo Clinic comprehensive cancer center</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving Mayo's care beyond its four walls</h2>



<p>Dr. Bold, who is also a surgical oncologist and a specialist in endocrine surgery, says many patients in need of cancer care find themselves geographically isolated.</p>



<p>"Even here in the United States, not everyone has a hospital or even a cancer center within 15 minutes or 30 minutes," says Dr. Bold.</p>



<p>"All of the Mayo hospitals see themselves serving the community around them and elevating access to care by developing partnerships and relationships that takes our outcomes and clinical expertise and pushes it out into the community. This moves our care beyond our four walls," adds Dr. Bold.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Increasing access to cancer screenings</h2>



<p>According to the<a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/">&nbsp;American Cancer&nbsp;</a><a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Society</a>&nbsp;January report, the risk of dying from cancer has steadily declined in the last 30 years.</p>



<p>However, the&nbsp;<a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>&nbsp;also indicated there has been a rise in diagnoses of six of the 10 most common cancers, including&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-why-black-women-should-consider-screening-for-breast-cancer-earlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/prostate-cancer-screening-and-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-understanding-endometrial-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endometrial</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-understanding-endometrial-cancer/">,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-advancing-pancreatic-cancer-treatment-with-total-robotic-whipple-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-is-kidney-cancer-treated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-melanoma-misconception-dark-skin-tones-at-risk-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melanoma</a>.</p>



<p>Early detection is critical in the fight against cancer by significantly improving the chances of successful treatment and long-term survival. Dr. Bold says research is underway to develop cancer screening tools that are more convenient and less costly for patients.</p>



<p>"<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-why-cancer-screenings-for-the-lgbtq-community-are-important/">Cancer&nbsp;</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-why-cancer-screenings-for-the-lgbtq-community-are-important/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screening</a>&nbsp;is probably one of the biggest things we have to reduce the burden of cancer in our communities, but not everyone has access to screening," explains Dr. Bold. "How can we make that better and easier for patients? This would really help us close the gap in our health disparities related to cancer detection in its earliest stage, which is where cures happen."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Personalized medicine</h2>



<p>Doctors at Mayo Clinic are also working on closing gaps in cancer care with&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-oxford-nanopore-announce-collaboration-to-advance-precision-medicine-for-cancer-and-genetic-disorders/">personalized or&nbsp;</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-oxford-nanopore-announce-collaboration-to-advance-precision-medicine-for-cancer-and-genetic-disorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">precision</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-oxford-nanopore-announce-collaboration-to-advance-precision-medicine-for-cancer-and-genetic-disorders/">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-oxford-nanopore-announce-collaboration-to-advance-precision-medicine-for-cancer-and-genetic-disorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medicine</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Bold says this approach can help better identify the right treatment for the right patient.</p>



<p>"Let's take breast cancer, for example. Each woman is very different. Understanding why the cancer developed at an individualized level is something that will help us determine better outcomes," says Dr. Bold. "Maybe it's a woman's genes. Maybe it's where she lived. Maybe her environmental history or what she ate."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/10/Patient-radiation-therapy-mask-showing-laser-lines-for-targeting-cancer-cells-in-the-brain_shutterstock_621261359.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Proton beam therapy targets and destroys cancer cells with highly advanced precision</strong></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Innovation transforming cancer care</h2>



<p>Dr. Bold says the intersection of innovative technology and health outcomes is helping eliminate barriers to cancer care.</p>



<p>"Radiation therapy, for example, can last for weeks, even months, which can pose a challenge for patients traveling from rural communities or far from home," says Dr. Bold.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, patients can receive&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-mayo-clinic-study-reveals-proton-beam-therapy-may-shorten-breast-cancer-treatment/">proton&nbsp;</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-mayo-clinic-study-reveals-proton-beam-therapy-may-shorten-breast-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beam&nbsp;</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-mayo-clinic-study-reveals-proton-beam-therapy-may-shorten-breast-cancer-treatment/">therapy</a>, a highly advanced cancer treatment that targets cancer cells painlessly and with more precision.</p>



<p>Proton therapy can be a game-changer for many patients because of the benefits it offers over traditional radiation therapy.</p>



<p>"Not everybody has the ability to move or separate themselves from their local environment, family and friends, and leave their home to receive cancer treatment," explains Dr. Bold.</p>



<p>"By using proton beam therapy, we can shorten their treatment time so we are broadening access and making it more convenient for patients to get treatments that are just as good, if not better, but in a way that's minimally disruptive for their lives," he adds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"<strong>The impact of cancer treatment on patients can be disruptive. Technology allows us to offer treatments that are faster, shorter, more efficient and better ultimately for society.</strong>"</p><cite>Rick Bold, M.D.<br>MAYO CLINIC COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The future of cancer care</h2>



<p>Eliminating disparities and barriers to cancer care is part of Mayo Clinic's overall commitment to improving health outcomes by advancing health equity, inclusion and diversity.</p>



<p>"Our goal and hope for the future is eliminating cancer, period, so that it's no longer a disease anybody has to think about. That is our long-term goal." says Dr. Bold.</p>



<p>"In the short term, we would like to achieve equitable cancer care that provides the best outcomes for every patient."</p>

<p>Early stage cervical cancer may produce no distinct symptoms, making these regular screenings lifesaving.<br><br>"It's really in later-stage cervical cancer where you can see things like abnormal vaginal bleeding and pain, in general or with intercourse," she says.</p>



<p>The biggest risk factor for developing cervical cancer —<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> HPV infection</a> — can be prevented with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/in-depth/hpv-vaccine/art-20047292?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vaccine</a>.</p>



<p>"There is a vaccine out there that can be given as early as 9 years old and up to 45 years old. It is very important to know it's not only for women, but actually also for men," says Dr. Cardenas-Trowers.</p>



<p>Access to healthcare and establishing trust is essential to help reduce the cervical cancer mortality rate for Black women, says Dr. Cardenas-Trowers. Her advice for all women is to establish care with a primary care clinician, undergo the recommended screening and get the HPV vaccine for yourself, if you're eligible, and for your children.</p>
