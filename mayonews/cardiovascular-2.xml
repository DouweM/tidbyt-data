<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My dad was diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis shortly after his 70<sup>th</sup> birthday. It's difficult to pronounce let alone understand. What is cardiac amyloidosis? Am I at risk if it is genetic?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyloidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amyloidosis</a> is a rare condition defined by the abnormal production of proteins that bind together to form amyloid proteins. These amyloids can gather in different organs throughout the body, including the heart, liver and kidneys. When amyloids form in the heart, the condition is referred to as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/multimedia/how-does-amyloid-affect-the-heart/vid-20207025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac amyloidosis</a>.</p>



<p>In cases of cardiac amyloidosis, the amyloids can lead to the thickening of the heart wall, disrupting heart function. This thickening makes it more challenging for the heart to fill with blood between beats. Cardiac amyloidosis also can affect the heart's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pacemaker/multimedia/the-conduction-system/img-20008516#:~:text=The%20heart's%20conduction%20system%20also,called%20the%20heart's%20natural%20pacemaker." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrical system</a>, causing an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668">irregular heart rhy</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668">hm</a>.</p>



<p>There are some genetic factors that increase the risk of developing heart disease in certain populations, including amyloidosis, which has a genetic component. We see this at a high prevalence in African American populations. There are specific genetic factors that place Black people at a greater risk for developing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, and there are specific heart disease types that have genetic factors linked to them. Cardiac amyloidosis is one of them and is one of the heart conditions that affect the heart-pumping function of the muscle.</p>



<p>Having a strong family history of traditional risk factors, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, significantly increases the risk of developing heart disease. If your family has had it before, you may be more likely to develop one of these heart disease risk factors. However, these are modifiable risk factors, which gives us hope that we can prevent heart disease in these patients.</p>



<p>The treatment for these conditions is many-sided. First is focusing on lifestyle change — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-blog/hlv-20049477?p=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eating healthier</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/basics/stress-relief/hlv-20049495?p=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minimizing stress</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-enough/faq-20057898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting enough sleep</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regular physical activity</a>. If you have some of these conditions such as diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure), you also may need to take medications to control them. It takes adequate follow-up with your healthcare team to ensure that it's under control.</p>



<p>At our <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiac-amyloidosis-clinic/overview/ovc-20508423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardiac Amyloidosis Clinic</a>, people with a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis receive treatment from a team of experts. If you have related symptoms such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/leg-swelling/basics/definition/sym-20050910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swelling</a> of the ankles and legs, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/definition/sym-20050890#:~:text=Shortness%20of%20breath%20%E2%80%94%20known%20medically,breath%20in%20a%20healthy%20person." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a>, irregular heart rhythm, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain</a> or an unexplained <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113">stroke</a>, it's important to talk with cardiologists who understand the condition.</p>



<p>Early diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is crucial for successful treatment in addition to identifying which kind of amyloid you have. Tests and procedures to determine this may include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-disease/art-20049357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/urinalysis/about/pac-20384907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urine</a> tests, an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/skin-biopsy/about/pac-20384634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biopsy</a> tissue sample or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mri/about/pac-20384768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI</a> of the heart.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic specialists treat more than 2,500 people with amyloidosis every year and work to improve treatment and reduce side effects for patients. They also have discovered new forms of amyloidosis. Talk with your healthcare team about treatment that might help. You or your family member might be eligible for <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/search-results?keyword=cardiac%20amyloidosis&amp;studySiteStatusesGrouped=Open/Status%20Unknown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trials</a> in cardiac amyloidosis. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/brewer-laprincess-c-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20415346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>LaPrincess Brewer, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Cardiovascular Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.</em></strong></p>

<p>“We have excellent treatments to reverse stroke symptoms, but these treatments are incredibly time-dependent,” says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/english-stephen-w-jr-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20491968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stephen English</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/neurology/home/orc-20117057?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurologist</a>.</p>

<p>The first <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350119?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> that we can potentially offer is a medication that helps to dissolve blood clots," says Dr. English. "The second stroke treatment is a treatment where we can intervene by placing a catheter, a small tube in your blood vessels, and navigate to that clot in your brain using an X-ray. Then, we can administer a device or use suction to help remove the blood clot."</p>

<p>Wetting a line and catching fish is just one of the many passions of young teen Braxton Wohlferd.</p>



<p>"Whatever they like to bite is what I like to throw," Braxton says. "I just like the aspect of being outdoors and just hanging out with people and having fun."</p>



<p>But earlier this year, this healthy, athletic high schooler from St. Charles, Minnesota, had his world turned upside down in a flash.</p>



<p>"He called frantically," says Melissa Wohlferd, Braxton's mother.</p>



<p>It was the morning after his 16<sup>th</sup> birthday. Braxton thought he had the stomach flu. He was vomiting. Suddenly, it got much worse.</p>



<p>"I was like, 'You need to get home. Something's not right,'" Braxton says.</p>



<p>His mom, Melissa, a registered nurse, arrived moments later. "And he was lying on the floor, and his hands and feet were mottling," she says.</p>



<p>"My hands were turning, like, blue, almost. And then we tried to come upstairs, and I collapsed on the third stair," Braxton says.</p>



<p>"He said, 'Mom, I just can't do it. I can't catch my breath. My chest hurts,'" Melissa says.</p>



<p>Braxton was rushed to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/emergency-medicine/sections/overview/ovc-20536584?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emergency Department</a> at Mayo Clinic. Not long after he arrived, he went into <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest</a>. Life-saving CPR was performed until Braxton was put on a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ecmo/about/pac-20484615?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life support machine</a>.</p>



<p>"I believe it was 22 minutes, full chest compressions. His heart never beat again," Melissa says.</p>



<p>But why?</p>



<p>"Completely healthy and then, within a blink of an eye, he's hooked up to every machine possible, keeping him alive," Melissa says.</p>



<p>Doctors at Mayo soon solved the mystery — a common childhood illness called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parvovirus-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20376085?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parvovirus B19</a>, also known as fifth disease.</p>



<p>"The majority of people who get parvovirus may not even know that they've had it," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ameduri-rebecca-k-m-d/bio-20519998?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Rebecca Ameduri</a>, medical director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center/pediatric-cardiology/overview?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pediatric Heart Failure and Heart Transplant Program</a> at Mayo Clinic. "Most people, when they get parvovirus, will just have kind of common cold effects and will not have severe side effects like Braxton did."</p>



<p>Braxton's body had an extremely rare reaction to the virus causing his own immune system to attack and break down his heart muscle. "They said it was more likely to get struck by lightning," Melissa says.</p>



<p>"Sometimes, in cases like Braxton, it's what we call fulminant <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352539?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myocarditis</a>, where it happens very rapidly, where those children can deteriorate in less than 24 hours," says Dr. Ameduri.</p>



<p>Braxton's only option was a heart transplant. "It was just so scary," Melissa says.</p>



<p>In less than a week, a miracle occurs. A donor heart arrives. "It was a perfect match for Braxton," Melissa says.</p>



<p>And a heart transplant performed by Mayo Clinic surgeons is a success. "It's kind of surreal to think that I'm still here," Braxton says.</p>



<p>"Without that organ donor, Braxton would not be here," Melissa says.</p>



<p>"Thank you doesn't even cover what I'd like to say. It's unbelievable. It's a selfless act that they give their organs away," Braxton says.</p>



<p>The virus also affected Braxton's legs, causing a condition known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350830?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compartment syndrome</a>, which required emergency surgery to remove some of his leg muscles.</p>



<p>"I feel great. Feel like I'm getting my strength back, and I'm gonna keep working at it and plan on keep getting stronger," Braxton says.</p>



<p>Braxton hopes to be back playing baseball next year and planning plenty of future fishing trips.</p>



<p>"I don't know how many other people would have went through this and survived," Braxton says. "They said I was very lucky, I'm a miracle. And I feel like I'm a miracle."</p>

<p>Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when a person stops and starts breathing while asleep. It happens because the throat muscles relax and block the airway.</p>



<p>"The tongue can fall backwards and can obstruct the airway, causing either snoring or obstruction," says Dr. Somers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/09/sleep-apnea-16x9-1.jpg" alt="Medical illustration of sleep apnea" class="wp-image-249304" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/09/sleep-apnea-16x9-1.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/09/sleep-apnea-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>When a person is breathing normally, their <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/hypoxemia/basics/definition/sym-20050930?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood oxygen saturation level</a> is usually between 95% and 100%. Dr. Somers says obstructive sleep apnea can drop that oxygen level down to as low as 70% or 60%. It can cause high blood pressure and strain your cardiovascular system, increasing the risk of heart problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"What we can do is give you an oxygen monitor to wear at home and look at the oxygen tracing. And if it looks problematic, then you can have a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/polysomnography/about/pac-20394877?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep study</a>," he says.</p>



<p>If you're diagnosed with sleep apnea, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352095?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> may include weight loss; a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP; a mouthpiece designed to keep the throat open; postural therapy to prevent you from sleeping on your back; or even surgery or implanting a device that stimulates the airway to be more open during sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:03) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/SCRIPT-MCM-Daytime-sleepiness-SCRIPT-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Needing to rest your body after a great workout or after a long day of work are examples of being tired — which is different than being sleepy.</p>



<p>"Being excessively sleepy during the daytime is, in a sense, falling asleep very quickly, having a very short period between the time you lay down or the time you sit down and actually falling asleep, and having no clear, obvious cause for being sleepy, or a cause related to a sleep disorder," says Dr. Somers.</p>



<p>While there are many causes, the bottom line is excessive daytime sleepiness means you’re not getting enough quality restorative sleep.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using an alarm clock?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/03/man-waking-up-from-sleep-and-turning-off-alarm-clock-16x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="man waking up from sleep and turning off alarm clock, excessive daytime sleepiness

<p>"When you need an alarm clock to wake you up, then by definition, you haven't had enough sleep," says Dr. Somers. "Because you could have slept more."</p>



<p>Not getting the sleep your body needs can pose health risks.</p>



<p>"There seems to be an association between being sleepy and having a higher risk of cardiovascular disease," says Dr. Somers. "We've found — independent of other things that we can identify that increased cardiovascular risk — that daytime sleepiness seems to be linked to a higher risk of heart disease, of sudden death, of cardiovascular death."</p>



<p>Read about Dr. Somer's <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/excessive-daytime-sleepiness-and-cardiovascular-mortality-in-us-adults-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-NSS">research</a> on excessive daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular mortality in adults across the U.S.</p>

<p><em>World Heart Day is September 29</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>JACKSONVILLE, Florida — Leg pain and leg cramps aren’t always an orthopedic issue: Both can be signs of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peripheral artery disease</a>, or PAD, a serious blood-flow issue with implications for the heart. In this expert alert, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/erben-young-m-m-d/bio-20446384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Young Erben, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/vascular-and-endovascular-surgery/overview/ovc-20458819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vascular surgeon</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/international" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Jacksonville, Florida, explains how the most common form, PAD that affects the legs and feet, is treated. Options include a surgical technique from the past that Mayo surgeons are reviving and refining to offer new hope to patients with advanced PAD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In peripheral artery disease, narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the affected limbs. They do not get enough blood flow to keep up with the demand. It is important to manage PAD as early as possible, Dr. Erben says. In the worst cases, PAD can progress to open sores that do not heal, causing tissue death and limb loss.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Dr.-Young-Erben_1655644_3919639_0016-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-394196" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Dr.-Young-Erben_1655644_3919639_0016-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Dr.-Young-Erben_1655644_3919639_0016.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Young Erben, M.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Globally, peripheral artery disease tends to be undertreated, even though doctors widely recognize it as a risk factor for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>. PAD has become more prevalent in recent years; at least 113 million people worldwide 40 or older have the disease, <a href="https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/library/global-burden-peripheral-artery-disease-and-its-risk-factors-1990-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2023 report shows</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lower extremity PAD, or PAD in the legs and feet, is a spectrum,” Dr. Erben says. “It ranges from people who have leg pain when walking to more advanced cases, where the blood flow to the leg is so impaired that patients are in pain when they’re resting or are developing wounds in their toes and feet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Common symptoms include leg pain or cramps while walking and small sores on the feet that do not heal, Dr. Erben says. Your first inclination might be to think of these as small things to ignore, but it is best to bring up these symptoms with your healthcare team, she advises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Especially if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or smoke cigarettes and you have these aches and pains, bring it up to your doctor because it may uncover something,” Dr. Erben says. “Those little details are how we catch most PAD.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Treatment depends on where someone is on the spectrum. Early on the spectrum, treatment typically includes:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Addressing risk factors for peripheral artery disease such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high cholesterol</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking/basics/quitsmoking-basics/hlv-20049487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Screening for additional blood-flow problems, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>, may be needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Developing a walking program — typically involving time on a treadmill — that the patient can pursue at home or with a physical therapist or trainer.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>“Walking develops new collateral blood vessels and increased blood flow to the legs,” Dr. Erben explains. “I have seen it with my patients over time: Over three to six months, if they’re very diligent about walking, the pain with walking will diminish, and people who are in the very early stages of PAD can almost go back to normal.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>People in the middle of the PAD spectrum will have more plaque buildup and blockages in blood vessels in their legs. Medication may be needed to increase blood flow. In some cases, a procedure may be needed, such as the minimally invasive insertion of balloons and/or stents to open arteries; surgery to remove blockages; or bypass surgery, in which a surgeon removes a vein from another area in the body and connects it above and below a blocked artery to improve blood flow, Dr. Erben says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blood thinners may be prescribed to help maintain the improved circulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the most advanced peripheral artery disease, people may have ulcers in their feet that become infected. The goal then becomes saving the affected limb: Surgeons may perform bypasses and, in some cases, an operation called deep vein arterialization (DVA), in which they connect an artery with a vein to try to provide additional blood flow to help wounds heal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This procedure was pioneered elsewhere in the 1970s. It lost popularity amid the development of less-invasive techniques such as balloons and stents that could be used earlier in PAD. Vascular surgeons at Mayo Clinic are now reviving and refining it, Dr. Erben says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is considered an innovation, but it is one of those that was an old technique, then somehow forgotten, and now it has been resurrected. We started doing this roughly three years ago for patients whose limbs are threatened in the last stage of PAD and we are having success.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In very advanced cases of peripheral artery disease, treatment may require amputation of the affected limb, such as toes or the leg below or above the knee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The worst-case scenarios with advanced PAD and the success often seen when the disease is recognized and managed early, are why it’s important to tell your doctor if you start experiencing recurring <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscle-cramp/symptoms-causes/syc-20350820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leg cramps</a>, also known as charley horses; leg pain that starts with exercise and ends with rest or that doesn’t go away; or a foot sore, even a small one, that lingers, Dr. Erben says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The mild symptoms are the ones that people tend to ignore,” Dr. Erben says. “Unfortunately, they often do not realize that they have a problem until it becomes a dire problem. The most important message that I can give to patients is that you may think it’s a little complaint, but please bring it up to your doctor. Because it may uncover something that you never thought of.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."

<p>"Colorectal cancers and breast cancers are on the rise in the Hispanic community. And one of those reasons may be from lack of preventive screening," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says culture, access to care and past experiences contribute. But early screening can prevent future serious health issues.</p>



<p>"Screening tests for diabetes&nbsp;(such as checking a simple blood sugar), for cardiovascular disease to prevent strokes&nbsp;(such as checking on cholesterol and blood pressure), colon cancer screening,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/when-to-start-regular-breast-cancer-screenings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer screening</a>&nbsp;for females, are all available tools," he says.</p>



<p>Talk with your doctor to determine the right preventive screenings and when to begin. For instance:&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Colon cancer screening for both men and women, usually at age 45, is an option, breast cancer screening for women in their 40s such as with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram,</a>" he says.</p>

<p>Dr. Bracamonte recommends having a list of questions for your doctor about what you can do to stay healthy.</p>



<p>"Have that list prepared about what I should get done to keep me healthy in the long term. What behaviors can I do in the long term to stay healthy? Because I think prevention is a key," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<p>Genetic technology has the potential to significantly improve human health by improving disease risk prediction and guiding prevention strategies. The development of a new genetic test called a polygenic risk score is a major advance. Still, it may widen health disparities because such scores may not work equally well for different populations. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kullo-iftikhar-j-m-d/bio-00084951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iftikhar Kullo, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic, believes that global collaboration is needed to refine polygenic risk scores so they perform equitably across people from diverse groups.</p>



<p>Dr. Kullo recently authored a perspective piece in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01843-2#:~:text=Such%20collaborations%20should%20be%20guided,assessment%2C%20global%20collaboration%20is%20critical." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Genetics</a>, where he made the case for efforts to bring genomics to low- and middle-income countries. His argument is that the information gleaned from testing could not only benefit local populations but also many other groups around the world, including in the U.S. Here, he elaborates on this.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You've noted that the disease burden worldwide is shifting from communicable diseases such as &nbsp;hepatitis and influenza to noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer. How can genetics address this shift?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> The shift from infectious disease to noncommunicable disease is part of the "epidemiologic transition." Famines and pandemics were once the leading cause of mortality, but fortunately, these were addressed by antibiotics, vaccinations and adequate food production. Now, we live longer and, as a result, are prone to developing other diseases like heart disease, diabetes or cancer. One of the ways that we can reduce the burden of these noncommunicable diseases is to employ better ways of predicting risk. For many of these conditions, we have existing tools for risk prediction, but they don't always perform as well as we would like them to.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You are referring to a new genetic test called a polygenic risk score. Could you explain what a polygenic risk score is, and how it works?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Genetically, humans are 99.9% similar. Our genome has three billion letters (A, G, T and C), and every 1,000 letters or so, there is a variation or difference between any two people. These differences, or variants, account for how we look or behave, how we might react to drugs, and our predisposition to different diseases. Polygenic risk scores add up information from multiple such genetic variants that affect our risk of developing certain diseases. Each variant is not very useful by itself, but if we combine the information from many — thousands or even millions of variants in some cases — we get useful and actionable information about disease risk.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the limitation of polygenic risk scores? How could they widen global health disparities?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Polygenic risk scores don't perform well across different genetic ancestry groups. Because the vast majority of genetic studies are done in people of European genetic ancestry, these scores don't work very well, for example, in people of African genetic ancestry. One way we can address that disparity is to increase diversity in our studies here in the U.S., but an even better approach may be to undertake a global effort, conducting this work in diverse regions across the globe. We know that using diverse sources of data will improve the performance of these scores for everybody.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You wrote that African datasets are still a high priority for genomic studies. Yet, they are the least represented — less than 2% of human genomes analyzed so far are of people with African genetic ancestry. How can studying African genomes help advance our understanding of the genomic basis of common diseases in all people?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Africa contains the greatest genetic diversity among the continents, accumulated over 300,000 years of human evolution. By studying people of African ancestry, we will learn so much more about human origins and genetics because we're all Africans, in a way — that's where Homo sapiens arose. That long evolutionary history means that African populations could yield more information about genetic variants associated with disease. And it's a chance to make up for this big disparity in the number of Africans in genomic studies thus far.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What steps do you believe are necessary to achieve equity in the availability of polygenic risk scores to improve global health?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> We certainly need to increase the representation of minorities in genomic studies. Mayo Clinic is part of a large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded consortium called <a href="https://emerge.study/mayo-clinic/">eMERGE</a> that is looking at polygenic risk scores for 10 common conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, breast cancer and prostate cancer. The consortium is committed to ensuring that at least half of the 25,000 participants across the country come from diverse groups.</p>



<p>It's important to learn about the spectrum of genetic variation in all of humanity, not just in one group. I believe that means going beyond our borders, helping other countries to set up infrastructure to generate their own genetic data and creating resources for data-sharing across the globe. It's not an easy task, but we have many elements in place, and I think it's doable.</p>

<p>When Roger Thomsen had his first episode several years ago, the 69-year-old retired repairman felt lightheaded. He checked his pulse. His heart rate was around 200 beats per minute. A typical pulse is 60 to 100.</p>



<p>"I told the wife, I said, 'I think we need to go to the doctor,'" Roger says.</p>



<p>Roger soon learned he has a heart condition called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ventricular-tachycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355138?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ventricular tachycardia</a>, also called V-tach or VT.</p>



<p>"Ventricular tachycardia is an abnormal rapid rhythm arising from the bottom chambers of the heart that can cause significant symptoms to patients," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/siontis-konstantinos-m-d/bio-20503925?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Konstantinos Siontis</a>, a Mayo Clinic electrophysiologist.</p>



<p>It can even be fatal. Essentially a short circuit caused by scar tissue on the heart, a common treatment for V-tach is a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ventricular-tachycardia-ablation/pyc-20385006?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">catheter ablation</a>. Doctors enter the heart through blood vessels using a catheter to create tiny scars with heat energy and block the irregular signals. Roger had several of these complex ablations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The symptoms came back. I was in the hospital a couple two, three times after that," Roger says.</p>



<p>So a couple of years ago, Roger enrolled in a clinical trial at Mayo Clinic. He would be one of the first of a handful of patients with V-tach to have a precise form of radiation typically used in cancer treatments, called proton beam therapy, used on the heart.</p>



<p>"Got nothing to lose. And the way it was, it wasn't working good," Roger says.</p>



<p>"Proton beam is a unique type of radiation that's actually a charged particle. It's able to deliver the energy of radiation at a specific depth or target in tissue without any exit dose beyond," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merrell-kenneth-w-m-d/bio-20434012">Dr. Kenneth Merrell</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist.</p>



<p>"With catheter ablation, there are certain areas within the heart that can be difficult to access," says Dr. Siontis.</p>



<p>And unlike a catheter ablation, proton beam therapy is completely noninvasive.</p>



<p>"The patient does not require anesthesia. They can walk into the treatment area and walk out the same day within about 30 minutes to an hour of completing the treatment," says Dr. Siontis.</p>



<p>It's nearly a year since Roger has had an abnormally rapid heart rhythm. </p>



<p>"It made it so it was working," Roger says. Which is the type of result the research team at Mayo says could bring new hope for some patients with V-tach.</p>



<p>"This was an encouraging first step," says Dr. Siontis. </p>



<p>While more study is needed, researchers are excited for the future. "Most likely, this will be another tool in the tool belt for us to use in patients," says Dr. Merrell.</p>



<p>The full results of the clinical trial using proton beam therapy to treat VT have yet to be published. The team at Mayo plans to present them later this year.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart failure during pregnancy is a dangerous and often under-detected condition because common symptoms – shortness of breath, extreme fatigue and trouble breathing while lying down – are easily mistaken for typical pregnancy discomforts. Late-breaking research presented at the <a href="https://esc365.escardio.org/ESC-Congress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Society of Cardiology Congress</a> on a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> study showed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital stethoscope helped doctors identify twice as many cases of heart failure compared to a control group that received usual obstetric care and screening. Full <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03243-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study findings are published in Nature Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>The trial was conducted in Nigeria, where more women experience pregnancy-related heart failure than anywhere in the world. The results also indicate that screening including the AI-enabled digital stethoscope were 12-times more likely than traditional screening to flag heart pump weakness when evaluated at an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/expert-answers/ejection-fraction/faq-20058286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ejection fraction</a> threshold lower than 45%, which is the cutoff indicating a specific type of heart failure called <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiomyopathy/what-is-cardiomyopathy-in-adults/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-ppcm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peripartum cardiomyopathy</a>.</p>



<p>"Recognizing this type of heart failure early is important to the mother's health and well-being," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20507418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demilade Adedinsewo, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and lead investigator of the study. "The symptoms of peripartum cardiomyopathy can get progressively worse as pregnancy advances, or more commonly following childbirth, and can endanger the mother's life if her heart becomes too weak. Medicines can help when the condition is identified but severe cases may require intensive care, a mechanical heart pump, or sometimes a heart transplant, if not controlled with medical therapy."</p>



<p>The randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial included nearly 1,200 participants who were screened for heart conditions through typical obstetric care or AI-enhanced solutions. Mayo Clinic researchers previously developed a foundational 12-lead AI-electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm to predict a weak heart pump, clinically known as low ejection fraction. A version of this algorithm was further enhanced by Eko Health for its point-of-care digital stethoscope which is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared to detect heart failure with low ejection fraction.</p>



<p>The researchers found that doctors using AI-based screening with the digital stethoscope and 12-lead ECG detected weak heart function with high accuracy. Within the study cohort, the digital stethoscope helped flag twice as many cases of low ejection fraction &lt;50% and doctors using it were 12-times more likely to identify an ejection fraction &lt;45% as compared to usual care.</p>



<p>The AI-supported tools were evaluated at three different levels of ejection fraction used in clinical diagnosis. Less than 45% is the cut point for diagnosing peripartum cardiomyopathy. Less than 40% indicates heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and has strong evidence in favor of specific medications to reduce symptoms and the risk of death. An ejection fraction of less than 35% signals severely low heart pump function that often requires more intense management, including advanced heart failure therapies and an implantable defibrillator if pump function does not recover. Patients in the intervention group each had an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a> at study entry to provide confirmation of the AI-predictions.</p>



<p>"This study provides evidence that we can better detect peripartum cardiomyopathy among women in Nigeria. However, there are more questions to be answered," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "Our next steps would be to evaluate usability and adoption of this tool by Nigerian healthcare providers (including doctors and nurses) and importantly, its impact on patient care.
