<p><em><strong>Editors Note: September is Sepsis Awareness Month</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My 86-year-old father was recently hospitalized with a severe infection. We were told he's at an increased risk for sepsis because of his age and medical history. What are the signs of sepsis to watch for now that he's returned home?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Nearly 270,000 people in the U.S. die annually because of sepsis — more than the number of people who die from prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS combined. Yet more than 40% of adults are unfamiliar with the danger of sepsis.</p>



<p>Sepsis occurs from an infection and can quickly become life-threatening. When your body has an infection, the natural response is for the immune system to fight the infection. If the body creates too much of a response to the infection, inflammation can develop, triggering sepsis.</p>



<p>Any type of infection that occurs anywhere in the body can lead to sepsis.</p>



<p>Infections that lead to sepsis most commonly occur in these parts of the body:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/listen-to-your-bladder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bladder</a> and urinary tract</li>



<li>Gallbladder and biliary tract, which includes organs and ducts that make and store bile</li>



<li>Lungs</li>



<li>Skin</li>



<li>Soft tissues like fat or muscles</li>
</ul>



<p>There is a myth that only people who have been hospitalized are at risk of developing sepsis. In fact, 87% of cases originate outside of the hospital setting. Another myth is that sepsis is rare and only affects people with preexisting conditions.</p>



<p>Anyone can develop sepsis, but those at higher risk are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Adults 65 or older</li>



<li>Children under 12 months</li>



<li>People with weakened immune systems</li>



<li>People with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, lung disease, cancer and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-nutrition-tips-for-chronic-kidney-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney disease</a></li>



<li>People who have had a recent hospitalization</li>



<li>People who previously have had sepsis</li>
</ul>



<p>Symptoms of early sepsis can appear similar to other conditions, and survival depends on pinpointing the source of infection. Blood and urine tests and imaging scans may help identify the type and location of infection.</p>



<p>People at risk of sepsis or who previously have had sepsis should be proactive in talking with their healthcare team about the possibility of sepsis when they are feeling ill.</p>



<p>The acronym TIME is a helpful tool for recognizing and remembering the signs and symptoms of sepsis:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>T: Temperature</strong> — higher or lower than usual</li>



<li><strong>I: Infection</strong> — signs and symptoms of an infection</li>



<li><strong>M: Mental decline</strong> — sleepy, difficult to rouse, confused</li>



<li><strong>E: Extremely ill</strong> — severe pain, discomfort, shortness of breath</li>
</ul>



<p>Suspected sepsis should be handled as an emergency by calling 911 and going to a hospital, like you would do with a suspected <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/what-should-i-do-if-i-might-be-having-a-heart-attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a> or stroke. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/patient-stories/sepsis-diagnosis-prompts-quick-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Urgent response</a> and rapid, aggressive treatment increase the rate of survival.</p>



<p>Treating sepsis as early as possible is crucial to prevent it from worsening. Determining where the infection is and eliminating it is vital to keeping sepsis from progressing to severe sepsis or septic shock. Even with treatment, sepsis can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock, causing organ damage.</p>



<p>Close monitoring and treatment for sepsis occur in the hospital setting, typically with a combination of antibiotics, intravenous fluids and other medications, including vasopressors, corticosteroids or pain relievers. Supportive therapy, such as oxygen, kidney dialysis or mechanical ventilation and surgery may be needed to drain or remove the infection.</p>



<p>Many people who recover from sepsis return to the same level of activity they had before their bout with sepsis. Some people, especially those with weakened immune systems or chronic illnesses, may experience long-term effects.</p>



<p>Talk with your primary care clinician to determine if you're at increased risk of developing sepsis.</p>



<p>Take these steps to reduce your risk:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prevent infections.</strong><br>If you have chronic conditions, follow your healthcare team's directions to manage the conditions. Get recommended vaccines.</li>



<li><strong>Practice good hygiene.</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ws-of-healthy-hands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wash your hands</a> regularly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Clean and cover cuts until they're entirely healed.</li>



<li><strong>Know the signs and symptoms.</strong><br>Temperature, infection, mental decline and an extremely ill feeling — TIME —  are reasons to suspect sepsis and get help fast.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Editors note:</strong> September is National Suicide Prevention Month</em></p>



<p>Suicide affects people from all walks of life, cultures and socioeconomic statuses. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide rates</a> increased by 36% from 2000 to 2022. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/8-common-myths-about-suicide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide</a> is the second leading cause of death for people 10 to 14 and 25 to 34.</p>



<p>However, suicide is preventable.</p>



<p>Most people want to live, but they feel stuck because of how dire their situation feels and can't see alternative solutions. For some people, their ability to reason and problem-solve positive solutions is affected, resulting in impulsive decision-making.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to help someone with suicidal thoughts</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Whether you are a friend, family member, co-worker, teacher or community member, two crucial things you can do to help are:</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Reach out to a person who may be struggling with suicidal thoughts.</strong><br>It's as easy as saying, "I care, I'm here and I want to listen."</li>



<li><strong>Become familiar with suicide risk factors, warning signs and what to do to help.</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>These two actions can make the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/suicide-isnt-about-dying-its-about-perceived-relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difference between life and death</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Identifying suicide risks</h2>



<p>Risk factors do not cause or predict suicide. However, identifying risks helps you be aware of the possibility that someone may consider suicide.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Common suicide risks include:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Being the victim of bullying</li>



<li>Feeling hopeless</li>



<li>Feeling a loss of purpose</li>



<li>Feeling trapped and that the only way out is death</li>



<li>Feeling worthless</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/brushing-off-the-social-rust" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Loneliness</a></li>



<li>Shame, guilt and despair</li>



<li>Stressful life events</li>



<li>Trauma or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/speak-out-about-abuse-or-assault" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abuse</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are suicide warning signs?</h2>



<p>Making certain comments or exhibiting certain behaviors can often indicate a strong likelihood that someone is considering suicide.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Watch for someone who is:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Acting agitated, anxious or reckless</li>



<li>Displaying extreme mood swings</li>



<li>Giving away valued personal belongings</li>



<li>Increasing drug or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/recognizing-and-addressing-a-loved-ones-alcohol-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alcohol use</a></li>



<li>Showing anger or rage, or expressing a desire to seek revenge</li>



<li>Sleeping too little or too much</li>



<li>Talking about being a burden to others</li>



<li>Talking about feeling hopeless or having no purpose</li>



<li>Talking about feeling trapped or being in unbearable pain</li>



<li>Talking about wanting to die or wanting to kill themselves</li>



<li>Withdrawing or isolating</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How you can help someone who is feeling suicidal</h2>



<p>Becoming more aware of suicidal risk factors and warning signs is the first step. The second step is <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/suicide-crisis-develop-safety-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">knowing what to do when someone is potentially suicidal</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here are four interventions to keep in mind if you're in a situation to help someone who is feeling suicidal:</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ask.</strong><br>Directly ask if the person is considering suicide or wants to die. Avoid asking why. Instead, request that the person help you understand his or her thought process and current struggles. Thank the person for being honest and trusting you.</li>



<li><strong>Be willing to listen.</strong><br>Get involved and suspend judgment during your conversation. Be authentic, empathetic and sincere.</li>



<li><strong>Reduce risks.</strong><br>Remove or secure all guns, ammunition, and prescription and over-the-counter medications from the person's possession. Even acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be dangerous in this situation.</li>



<li><strong>Seek help for urgent needs.</strong><br>If someone verbalizes suicidal thoughts, has a plan, or tells you they will kill themselves, call 911 immediately or take the person to the nearest emergency department.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know about available resources</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Note these crisis phone numbers:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline</strong><br>Call 988 or chat at <a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">988lifeline.org</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Crisis text line</strong><br>Text "HOME" to 741-741.</li>
</ul>



<p>Everyone plays a role in suicide prevention. Stay aware of risks and warning signs, and do not hesitate to offer help when needed.</p>

<p><em><strong>Editors note:</strong> September is National Suicide Prevention Month</em></p>



<p>In 2021, suicide was the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S., claiming the lives of more than 48,000 people — nearly double the number of homicides. People of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds choose to end their own lives. That means that people of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds may be affected by suicide.</p>



<p>When learning that a loved one, friend, neighbor, work colleague or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/do-children-grieve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">child</a> has lost someone to suicide, you want to support them. Your first thought might be, "What do I say?"</p>



<p>Supporting someone <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/offering-support-to-the-grieving" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grieving</a> a suicide loss can be uncomfortable and even a bit scary. The support you provide is crucial to helping them navigate this tragedy, and it's essential to their mental health. Be aware that those who have lost someone to suicide are at a higher risk of dying from suicide, as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to start the conversation about suicide</h2>



<p>People who have lost a loved one to suicide may consider themselves a survivor. They may be experiencing a complex range of feelings from grief to anger, shame and fear. Being present and showing you care — without judgment — plays a vital role in supporting them.</p>



<p>When talking with the survivor, show you still remember their loved one. Use the person's name, share memories and maybe even photos of time spent together. Talking openly about the person can help remove the stigma of their death. Sometimes, all you need to do is listen.</p>



<p>The survivor may ask unanswerable questions, such as, "I don’t understand how this happened," or "How could they do this to me?" Validate those thoughts and acknowledge that neither of you has the answers. Provide support with statements such as, "This is very hard for you, and I'm sorry that I don't have any answers."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Maintaining connection after loss</h2>



<p>Often, a survivor hears most from their circles of family and friends shortly after the death, but then the connections taper off. The survivor's emotions and feelings haven't tapered off. That's why keeping in touch is so important.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/grief-and-loss-throughout-the-holiday-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holidays</a>, anniversaries, birthdays and other milestone events can be particularly difficult for survivors because they conjure up intense memories and emotions about their loved ones. Check in with survivors around these times. A "thinking of you" card, email or text may be all they need to know you're there for them. They may also ask for space, and that's OK too.</p>



<p>Also, remember to include the survivor in activities. If you've frequently met for coffee, extend the invitation again. If they enjoy the theater, ask if they'd like to go to a show with you. If the answer is "no," accept it and don't push, but don't give up on them. The time will come when they say, "Yes."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Be aware of suicide warning signs</h2>



<p>Because survivors are at greater risk of dying from suicide, pay attention to them. Listen to what they're saying and what they're not saying.&nbsp; And although it's uncomfortable for you — without judging them or minimizing their feelings — gently ask if they're having thoughts of suicide themselves.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are some questions to consider:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do you feel you have no hope for the future?</li>



<li>Do you feel you'd be better off dead?</li>



<li>Do you feel your loved ones would be better off without you?</li>



<li>Do you think you might try to hurt yourself today?</li>



<li>Have you had thoughts of suicide?</li>



<li>Have you been thinking of killing yourself?</li>



<li>Have you thought of ways you might hurt yourself?</li>



<li>What would you do to end your life?</li>
</ul>



<p>Setting aside your discomfort to ask a few questions can help the survivor feel supported and less alone, isolated and hopeless.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">If you're concerned for the survivor, here are some warning signs to watch for:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Acting anxious, agitated or behaving recklessly</li>



<li>Experiencing extreme mood swings</li>



<li>Increasing use of alcohol or drugs</li>



<li>Looking for a way to kill themselves like searching online or buying a gun</li>



<li>Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge</li>



<li>Sleeping too little or too much</li>



<li>Talking about being a burden to others</li>



<li>Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live</li>



<li>Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain</li>



<li>Talking about wanting to die or to kill themselves</li>



<li>Withdrawing or isolating themselves</li>
</ul>



<p>If you see these signs and are with the survivor, call 988, the national suicide and crisis line, a local crisis center or take them to the nearest emergency department.</p>



<p>Everyone plays a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/awareness-and-intervention-help-with-suicide-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">role in suicide prevention</a>. Stay connected with a survivor, listen to them, be aware of risks and warning signs, and don't hesitate to offer help when needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Resources</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Note these crisis phone resources:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline</strong><br>Call or text 988 or chat at <a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">988lifeline.org</a>.</li>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a> and was just diagnosed as having <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic kidney disease</a>. I am disheartened by this news, but I also am determined to do more to improve my health. I know I may not be able to reverse my condition, but I am hoping to avoid <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hemodialysis/about/pac-20384824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialysis</a> or a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777#:~:text=As%20a%20three%2Dsite%20institution,transplant%20before%20dialysis%20is%20needed." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> for as long as possible.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Your determination will help you manage your chronic kidney disease by following recommended treatments and making lifestyle changes.</p>



<p>As you know, kidneys remove waste and fluids from the body through urination. With chronic kidney disease, kidney function is gradually lost. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/end-stage-renal-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354532#:~:text=End%2Dstage%20renal%20disease%2C%20also,to%20meet%20your%20body's%20needs." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">End-stage renal failure</a> is when dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to stay alive.</p>



<p>Similar to how high blood pressure is called a silent killer, many people don't know they have chronic kidney disease until it is discovered during a lab test for another reason. Because kidney disease usually doesn't cause symptoms in earlier stages, it often is not discovered until later in the course of the disease process. In fact, one in nine people may not know they have chronic kidney disease, but it affects about 14% of the population. That's more than 30 million people in the U.S.</p>



<p>Your healthcare professional will discuss what's best to help slow progression of kidney disease in your situation, but some recommendations typically include:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Follow a kidney diet</strong></h2>



<p>One key dietary adjustment to prevent the development or progression of chronic kidney disease is <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-can-extra-salt-hurt-your-kidneys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sodium restriction</a>. Some people cook with a lot of salt and often add more salt at the table. Many processed foods also have added salt.</p>



<p>Reduce sodium intake by limiting convenience foods, salty snacks and processed meats and cheeses. Overall, try to eat fresher foods rather than foods that come out of a can or a bag. You can still <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/recipes/kidney-renal-diet-recipes/rcs-20522796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enjoy many foods</a>.</p>



<p>Increase fluid intake as well. Lack of fluid can lead to disease progression and affect how well medications work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Address underlying conditions</strong></h2>



<p>Treatments for chronic kidney disease usually involve tackling the underlying issue. One of the most common causes of chronic kidney disease is high blood pressure, also known as hypertension.</p>



<p>High blood pressure relates to the pressure inside of blood vessels when the heart is pumping and when it relaxes. That pressure can increase as we age. A number of medical problems are associated with increases in blood pressure over time, which can lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a> and chronic kidney disease. Controlling those disease processes is extremely important.</p>



<p>High blood pressure responds to our lifestyle choices, including getting regular exercise, avoiding processed foods, reducing sodium intake and eating more fruits and vegetables. All of these things reduce high blood pressure without medications.</p>



<p>Sometimes those lifestyle changes aren't enough. These are the patients who need medications to help with blood pressure control. The patient with chronic kidney disease typically has a goal blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg.</p>



<p>Some risk factors for kidney disease we can't control, such as our age and race. Being Black, Native American or Asian American, for example, increases the risk of kidney disease. But some risk factors can be controlled.

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:10) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/06/MCM-Pregnancy-and-listeria-SCRIPT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Planning a picnic is no walk in the park for those who are pregnant. That's because many foods associated with summertime carry an increased risk of listeria.</p>



<p>"Listeria is a type of bacteria that is usually transmitted through food and food products. It is especially a concern if you're pregnant, if you're elderly or if you have a weakened immune system for some reason," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>



<p>Listeria is a concern for pregnant people because of the risk of transmitting the infection on to the unborn baby.</p>



<p>"It can have really severe outcomes for babies, including risks of stillbirth or death," she says.</p>



<p>Deli meats, hot dogs and soft serve ice cream are foods typically associated with listeria. However, even foods that might be considered healthy for expecting mothers can carry a listeria risk.</p>



<p>"I looked back at the last few years of listeria outbreaks, and some of the more recent ones were related to bagged salads or packaged salads," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>



<p>With such a wide variety of different foods that can become contaminated with listeria, how can you keep yourself and your baby safe?</p>



<p>When it comes to deli meats and hot dogs, make sure they are cooked to 165 degrees F. Fruits and vegetables should be washed well. And keep an eye out for reported outbreaks linked to certain foods.</p>



<p>The symptoms of listeria can be things like fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain. It can cause a flu-like illness in pregnant women, so aches and pains, joint aches and pains, and fatigue, as well.</p>



<p>If you suspect that you could have a foodborne illness, contact your healthcare professional right away.</p>

<p>As a summer surge of COVID-19 outbreaks is underway, new vaccines for the virus have been released.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-and-authorizes-updated-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-better-protect-against-currently">Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a>&nbsp;approved new COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024-2025 season for people ages 6 months and older. These updated vaccines are designed to better protect against recently circulating variants, helping to prevent serious illness and hospitalization.</p>



<p>"It appears that this virus is going to continue to change as immunity in the population wanes, either after vaccination or prior infection. New strains of this virus will cause outbreaks at different times of the year," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/binnicker-matthew-j-ph-d/bio-20513862?_ga=2.224776410.1916523742.1658847814-1971724449.1645459629?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Matthew Binnicker,</a>&nbsp;director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview/specialty-groups/clinical-microbiology?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Virology Laboratory</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New COVID-19 variants can evade immunity from earlier vaccination or prior infection, meaning vaccinated or previously infected people may still catch the virus. However, their immunity helps protect them from severe illness.  </p>



<p>"The recent vaccines have been designed against a variant that we saw early in 2024. The immune response that's generated by these new vaccines is much more specific to the strains that are currently in circulation," says Dr. Binnicker.&nbsp;"Studies have shown that the immune response is much more pronounced and specific against these variants and helps keep some from getting COVID-19 and, most importantly, keep them from developing severe disease."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who should get the updated COVID-19 vaccines?</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s-t0627-vaccine-recommendations.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>&nbsp;recommends that everyone 6 months and older get the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine for better protection this fall and winter. Whether you’ve previously had a COVID-19 vaccine or not, it’s important to stay protected, says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>It's recommended that everyone should get the updated COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is available. Those who recently had an infection should wait three months, or those who had a dose of the older COVID-19 vaccine should wait two months. It is especially important for those who are at higher risk of severe infection.</p>



<p>"Those who are immune compromised, those who are over the age of 65, those with certain preexisting health conditions and those who are pregnant fall into a higher risk category should get the updated COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible," explains Dr. Binnicker. </p>



<p>Vaccine protection can wane over time, so staying updated with your COVID-19 vaccination is key to preventing severe illness, hospitalization and possibly death.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My friend was just diagnosed with Graves' disease, but I don’t know much about it. I want to be supportive and educate myself. What is Graves' disease, and how does it affect the body? How is it treated?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Graves' disease</a> is a condition of the immune system that leads to an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperthyroidism/symptoms-causes/syc-20373659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overactive thyroid</a>. It is caused by antibodies attacking the thyroid by mistake. The thyroid and the hormones it produces are the gas pedal for the body. When someone produces too much thyroid hormones, the body goes into overdrive. Your pulse increases, you overheat, you lose sleep — these symptoms make people feel so unwell that they seek medical attention. This is what leads to additional testing and the diagnosis of Graves' disease.</p>



<p>In overdrive, muscle strength is lost, and the heart beats faster, adding extra wear and tear. Much like a car running at a high RPM (revolutions per minute) for an extensive period of time, that's not good for the engine. The goal is to treat this overactive phase when treating Graves' disease.</p>



<p>The main complication of Graves' disease is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/thyroid-eye-disease-clinic-the-mayo-clinic-model/mac-20431277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid eye disease</a>. Inflammation and bulging of the eyes occur in a third of people diagnosed with Graves' disease. Managing thyroid eye disease requires an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/endocrinology/sections/overview/ovc-20392506#:~:text=Mayo%20Clinic's%20top%2Dranked%20team,of%20endocrine%20disorders%20and%20dysfunctions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endocrinologist</a> to address the thyroid and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ophthalmology/home/orc-20519115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ophthalmologists</a> who deal with eye changes. Ear, nose and throat (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20424084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ENT</a>) specialists are occasionally involved in surgeries related to the eye disease as well.</p>



<p>All these specialists operate together in a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/thyroid-eye-disease-clinic/overview/ovc-20503926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thyroid Eye Disease Clinic</a> at Mayo Clinic. The morning is dedicated to the patient moving between the different specialties and performing a set of specific tests. At noon, the specialists meet to discuss patient impressions, review the test results and create a care plan. The patient is seen again in the early afternoon, and the care plan is discussed. This includes suggestions on medication or surgery and clinical trials suited for that patient, dwelling in detail on the route the patient is interested in and contrasting it with the other choices. The benefit of this system is that a patient can get all this analysis done in one day, resulting in increased patient satisfaction. Also, the number of clinical trials is increasing, with more available choices forecasted for patients in the near future.</p>



<p>Research and innovation surrounding Graves' disease is another area of focus for the future. The ability to create molecules that hit a specific target has increased tremendously over the last few years. This is particularly effective when we know the mechanism of a disease and what the target should be. With thyroid eye disease, the main complication of Graves' disease, we know the receptor we aim to block. There have been a number of clinical trials&nbsp;that&nbsp;we are a part of that aim to block that receptor,&nbsp;improve the eye disease and,&nbsp;for some of these drugs, also treat the Graves' disease&nbsp;at the same time.</p>



<p>Targeting some of these areas has resulted in noticeable improvement in eye disease in the past several years. Furthermore, we are seeing that there are molecules in development that, in the next few years, will likely show ability to prevent the eye disease or reverse some of these changes that have already occurred. They'll do this by lowering, if not eliminating, the antibodies that are causing the problem in the first place. I am quite optimistic looking at some of the early results of our trials that there will be major benefits for patients in the coming years. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/stan-marius-n-m-d/bio-20055065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Marius Stan, M.D</strong></a><strong><em>., Endocrinology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I've just started going through menopause. The hot flashes and night sweats are so uncomfortable and keep me up at night. I've heard about hormone therapy — could that be an option for me? Are there any risks?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Navigating <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a> and its symptoms can be exhausting. To give you more information about hormone therapy, we must start with menopause. Menopause marks the end of your menstrual cycle and is diagnosed after 12 months without a menstrual period. The average age at which menopause begins in the U.S. is 51, but it can begin in your 40s. In the months or years leading up to menopause, women may experience:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hot-flashes/symptoms-causes/syc-20352790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hot flashes</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/night-sweats/basics/definition/sym-20050768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Night sweats</a></li>



<li>Trouble sleeping</li>



<li>Chills</li>



<li>Irritability or mood changes</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/menopause-weight-gain/art-20046058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weight gain</a></li>



<li>Irregular periods</li>



<li><a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/women-health/androgenic-alopecia-hair-loss-isnt-only-for-men/#:~:text=Known%20as%20androgenic%20alopecia%2C%20the,thinner%2C%20shorter%20and%20less%20dense." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hair thinning</a></li>



<li>Dry skin</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hormone therapy</a> can help manage a lot of these symptoms. Hormone therapy is medication containing hormones that your body stops producing during menopause. Hormone therapy is a safe option for the average healthy woman. Keep in mind, though, it is not for everybody.</p>



<p>There are many different options available for treatment. In general, transdermal therapies (therapies applied directly to the skin) are considered among the safest ways to administer hormone therapy. For example, there are patches that can be worn on the lower abdomen or buttock, gels can be applied to the inner thigh and sprays which go on the forearm. There are also oral routes you can take. Because of all the options we have nowadays, we usually are able to find an option that meets the average woman's specific needs.</p>



<p>After starting hormone therapy, many women experience complete or near complete resolution of hot flashes. If not, we aim to reduce them significantly enough to improve quality of life and help women regain a sense of normalcy. Hormone therapy may help many of the other symptoms women experience related to menopause such as mood changes, trouble sleeping, brain fog, skin changes and hair loss, to name a few. While these are common symptoms associated with menopause, we do not want to miss any more serious or underlying issues. So, it is best to talk to your doctor and ensure that any other potential contributing factors or underlying medical conditions are addressed. Hormone therapy has also been proven to prevent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone loss</a> and reduce fractures in women post-menopause.</p>



<p>If hormone therapy is not the right fit for you, there are several non-hormonal therapies that can be considered. Cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnosis have also been shown to ease menopausal symptoms.</p>



<p>It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle while undergoing hormone therapy. This includes staying <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/womens-wellness-fitness-tips-for-menopause/">physically active</a>, not smoking, managing stress, eating a nutritious diet and maintaining a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-combating-weight-gain-during-menopause/">healthy weight</a>. It is also important to keep up with all routine health screenings like mammograms, colonoscopies, bone density studies and routine physicals.</p>



<p>There are a lot of questions about the safety of hormone therapy — "Does it cause <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>? Will it increase my risk for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013">dementia</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>?" For the average healthy woman who is close to the menopause transition and younger than the age of 60, hormone therapy is typically a very safe option. Many of the risks associated with hormone therapy can be lessened by starting hormone therapy at the right time (within 10 years of menopause and before age 60), using transdermal therapy and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Talk to your healthcare team or a women’s health specialist i<em>f you are considering hormone therapy and aren’t sure if it’s right for you. — </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/smith-taryn-l-m-d/bio-20503248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Taryn Smith, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Women's Health, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>
