<p>Treating <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> may include personalized therapies or surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"There are only two surgical options: lumpectomy and mastectomy. But there are 100 reasons why women choose one thing or another," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mclaughlin-sarah-a-m-d/bio-20055048?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sarah McLaughlin</a>, a Mayo Clinic breast surgical oncologist. "Some of that can be cancer-based, some of it can be family history and genetic, some of it can be personal peace of mind."</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumpectomy/about/pac-20394650?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lumpectomy</a> removes the cancerous tissue and the surrounding margin of normal breast tissue.

Dr. McLaughlin explains that decades of research have shown similar long-term survival rates for both options.</p>

<p>"If you don't need a mastectomy, you don't do better or live longer because you do a more radical operation," says Dr. McLaughlin.</p>



<p>Surgical innovations are improving care and quality of life. Some patients no longer need lymph nodes under the armpit removed, and new techniques remove less skin while preserving the nipple and areola complex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"That means placing the incisions remote from the actual site of cancer and then rearranging the breast tissue within what remains," says Dr. McLaughlin.</p>



<p>It's important to work with your healthcare team to determine what treatments are best for you. Considerations may include the stage of cancer, your personal preferences and overall health.</p>

<p>"Melanin is the protein component of the skin that gives our skin color," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>Darker skin tones have more melanin. The pigment protects against sun damage and lowers the risk of skin cancer. Some people with dark complexions think melanin shields them from getting cancer. But Dr. Davis says that's a myth.</p>



<p>"All patients, including patients who are skin of color, have a risk of melanoma. Children can also have melanoma," explains Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melanoma</a> develops in people of color, it's often diagnosed at a later stage and is more aggressive. But that could be because skin cancer in people with darker skin may appear in unexposed areas.</p>



<p>"Under your armpits, in your genital area, under your nails, fingernails and toenails, and on the palms and soles," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>Dr. Davis says people of color, including children, should wear sunscreen and perform regular skin self-exams.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to reduce the risk of melanoma</h3>



<p>The longer you're exposed to the sun, the greater the risk for developing skin cancer. &nbsp;Dr. Davis says there are several things people can do to <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-importance-of-skin-">protect</a> their skin:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wear sunscreen of at least 30 SPF.</li>



<li>Perform regular skin self-exams.</li>



<li>See a healthcare professional for abnormal growths or warts.</li>



<li>Wear protective clothing.</li>

<p>When you think about <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato/services-and-treatments/bariatric-surgery/about-obesity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>, you may not connect it to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/topics/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>. However, researchers long have suspected a link between certain cancers and weight. Among those are endometrial, ovarian, colon, liver, pancreatic and postmenopausal breast cancers, which together contribute to 15 to 20% of all cancer deaths in the U.S.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cancer risk increases with obesity</h2>



<p>More than one-third of adults in the U.S. are considered obese with a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-bmi-is-not-the-only-indicator-of-your-overall-health/" target="_blank">body mass index (BMI)</a>&nbsp;of 30 or higher. BMI is the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/in-depth/bmi-calculator/itt-20084938" target="_blank">measure of body fat of body fat based on weight and height</a>. The number of people with severe obesity, which is a BMI of 40 or higher, has increased significantly. According to one study in the New England Journal of Medicine, if a person's BMI goes up by even five points, their cancer risk increases by 10%.</p>



<p>Those who are obese are two times more likely to develop cancer than those of optimal weight. For example, the risk for endometrial cancer increases sevenfold with a BMI of more than 40.</p>



<p>The greater risk of cancer appears to be due to excess body weight in the form of fat. Obesity causes fat cells in the body to increase. As the number of these fat cells goes up, the body's release of hormones changes. These changes tend to increase pro-inflammatory hormones and estrogen. This chronic inflammatory state can lead to damage in cells and the DNA in them, increasing the risk of certain types of cancers.</p>



<p>Researchers are studying the role body fat plays in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/want-to-ease-chronic-inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic inflammation</a>. In addition, hormones like estrogen and insulin resistance can lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/endocrinology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic metabolic diseases</a>, including diabetes. By 2050, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/diabetes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control</a> estimates that 1 in 3 adults will have diabetes along with its associated health complications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bariatric surgery and reduction of cancer risk link</h2>



<p>Researchers believe a decrease in inflammatory fat cells could reduce cancer risks, but more research is needed. And it's still unknown to what extent cancer risk is reversed with nonsurgical, also called intentional, weight loss.</p>



<p>But for anyone who has lost weight with lifestyle changes, the challenge is keeping it off. The body has many complex neurohormonal systems in place to avoid starvation, making it difficult to maintain weight loss.</p>



<p>At this time, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric or metabolic surgery</a> is the most effective treatment for obesity available, even when compared with medications and intensive lifestyle therapy. After surgery, people typically lose 50 to 70% of their excess weight or 25 to 35% of their total body weight, which often is sustained for many years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Continuing research</h2>



<p>Several large studies have been conducted to explore the link between weight loss through bariatric surgery and the reduction of cancer risk.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/fulltext/2019/01000/bariatric_surgery_and_the_risk_of_cancer_in_a.21.aspx" target="_blank">2019 article in the Annals of Surgery</a>, more than 22,000 people who had bariatric surgery were compared with 66,000 who didn't. The study participants were matched by sex, age, study site, BMI and other factors. Statistical models were used to look at the incidence of cancer up to 10 years after bariatric surgery compared to nonsurgical participants.</p>



<p>Those who had undergone bariatric surgery had a 33% lower risk of developing any type of cancer during the follow-up period compared to those who didn't have bariatric surgery. The results were even stronger when the outcome was restricted to obesity-associated cancers.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2793220" target="_blank">2022 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association</a>&nbsp;followed 30,000 people, all with a BMI greater than 35. The participants were divided into two groups and matched by factors including age and sex. One group of about 5,000 patients had undergone bariatric surgery; the other group of just over 25,000 patients didn't have surgery. The median follow-up period was about six years.</p>



<p>The follow-up showed that bariatric surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of obesity-related and other cancers. It also showed that patients who had undergone bariatric surgery had a decrease in cancer-related deaths compared with those who didn't have the surgery.</p>



<p>Researchers continue to delve into why and how bariatric surgery is reducing the risk of cancer and diabetes, and more studies are needed to confirm these results. However, there is promise for patients struggling with obesity that bariatric surgery can decrease metabolic diseases like diabetes and possibly the risk of cancer.</p>



<p>If you're considering bariatric surgery, this new evidence about its effectiveness and benefits may help you decide. It's another topic to discuss with your primary care provider or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/bariatric-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery team</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Editor's note:</strong> May 8 is World Ovarian Cancer Day.</p>



<p>Three cancers — ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer — are commonly called ovarian cancer. They arise from the same kind of tissue and are treated similarly.</p>



<p>"The ovaries and fallopian tubes are so anatomically close to each other that we sometimes can't tell if the cancer is coming from the ovary or the fallopian tube," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/weroha-john-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S. John Weroha, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic oncologist and chair of Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center's Gynecologic Cancer Disease Group. "When we diagnose patients with primary peritoneal cancer, I explain that under the microscope, and in the pattern of spread through the body, it looks like ovarian cancer even though the ovaries are not involved."</p>



<p>Primary peritoneal cancer forms in the peritoneum, the tissue that lines the abdominal cavity and the organs within it. Fallopian tube cancer forms in the tissue lining the inside of the tubes that eggs travel through to move from the ovaries to the uterus.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/ovarian-cancer/about/what-is-ovarian-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">About 85% to 90%</a>&nbsp;of ovarian cancers are ovarian epithelial cancers, also known as epithelial ovarian carcinomas, which form in the tissue lining the outside of the ovaries.</p>



<p>Dr. Weroha says new treatments are helping more people survive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>&nbsp;of all types, and researchers are studying new treatments and screening methods in clinical trials. If you've been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, he wants you to know there is hope. Here's why:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New targeted therapies are improving survival.</h2>



<p>Surgery and chemotherapy are no longer the only options for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer treatment</a>. Targeted therapies use drugs to target and attack cancer cells. These include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/monoclonal-antibody/art-20047808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monoclonal antibodies</a>&nbsp;and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, inhibitors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Monoclonal antibodies</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/monoclonal-antibody/art-20047808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monoclonal antibodies</a>&nbsp;are molecules engineered in the laboratory to find and attach to specific proteins associated with cancer cells.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/bevacizumab-intravenous-route/description/drg-20068373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bevacizumab</a>&nbsp;is a monoclonal antibody used with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;to treat ovarian cancer recurrence by preventing the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.</p>



<p>Researchers are combining bevacizumab with new drugs to improve outcomes. One example is a monoclonal antibody recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/elahere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mirvetuximab soravtansine</a>&nbsp;for people with ovarian cancer recurrence. This drug is used when a person's cancer was previously treated with at least one systemic therapy to target a protein called folate receptor alpha.</p>



<p>"Ovarian cancers have many folate receptors. Most normal cells don't," says Dr. Weroha. "This drug is an antibody that has chemotherapy stuck onto it. Think of it as a guided missile traveling the body and sticking to cells with folate receptors. In patients whose ovarian cancer has recurred and whose tumors have many folate receptors, mirvetuximab soravtansine can shrink tumors far better than any other therapy. The response rate is about double what you see with any other treatment."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">PARP inhibitors</h3>



<p>PARP inhibitors are drugs that block DNA repair, which may cause cancer cells to die. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/olaparib-oral-route/description/drg-20127672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olaparib</a> is an example of a PARP inhibitor used to prevent recurrence in people with ovarian cancer whose tumors have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36082969/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a> has shown that olaparib can significantly improve survival without recurrence in people with this diagnosis. "This is a front-line treatment, which means this is part of the first treatment regimen patients receive when they are newly diagnosed," says Dr. Weroha.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A vaccine may one day be used to fight ovarian cancer.</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/knutson-keith-l-ph-d/bio-00026672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keith Knutson, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic researcher, are&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/19/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-ovarian-cancer/">developing a vaccine</a>&nbsp;to prevent ovarian cancer tumors from returning in people with advanced ovarian cancer whose tumors have recurred after surgery and chemotherapy.</p>



<p>White blood cells are extracted from a blood draw and manufactured to become dendritic cells — immune cells that boost immune responses. These cells are returned to the patient in vaccine form to trigger the immune system to recognize and fight the cancer.</p>



<p>The vaccine will be given in combination with an immunotherapy drug called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/pembrolizumab-intravenous-route/description/drg-20122552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pembrolizumab</a>&nbsp;to identify and kill any tumors that don't respond to the dendritic cells.</p>



<p>"Pembrolizumab is in a category of drugs called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune checkpoint inhibitors</a>," says Dr. Weroha. "This drug is designed to release the brakes on the immune system to allow it to do what it naturally wants: kill things it doesn't like. The hope is that the vaccine combined with the immunotherapy drug will kill a lot of ovarian cancer. It's exciting research."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A screening test may be on the horizon.</h2>



<p>There is no screening test for ovarian cancer, but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bakkum-gamez-jamie-n-m-d/bio-20055230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Bakkum-Gamez, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gynecologic oncologist, is hoping to change that. She and her research team discovered that&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/02/07/a-step-toward-detecting-endometrial-cancer-earlier/">methylated DNA markers</a>&nbsp;could be used to identify&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endometrial cancer</a>&nbsp;through vaginal fluid collected with a tampon. Eventually, this same science could extend to ovarian cancer.</p>



<p>Methylation is a mechanism cells use to control gene expression — the process by which a gene is switched on in a cell to make RNA and proteins. When a certain area of a gene's DNA is methylated, the gene is turned off or silenced, indicating that a gene is a tumor suppressor. The silencing of tumor suppressor genes is often an early step in cancer development and can suggest cancer.</p>



<p>Dr. Bakkum-Gamez and her colleagues developed a panel of methylated DNA markers that could distinguish between endometrial cancer and noncancerous tissue in vaginal fluid. Based on this research, she hopes to develop an affordable tampon-based home screening test for endometrial, ovarian and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical</a>&nbsp;cancers, as well as high-risk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV</a>.</p>



<p>"This is exciting because this type of screening test can be used by people living in rural areas,” says Dr. Weroha. “If it's successful, it could help healthcare professionals identify ovarian and other gynecologic cancers sooner, when they're more treatable, in people living in all the communities we serve.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A gynecologic oncologist and clinical trials can help you get the best possible treatment.</h2>



<p>If you've been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, Dr. Weroha recommends making an appointment with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gynecologic-oncology/overview/ovc-20424080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gynecologic oncologist</a>. "A gynecologic oncologist will be up to date on the current treatment recommendations and the management of side effects. That's important," he says. "Once the plan is set, however, any medical oncologist could implement it.”</p>



<p>Dr. Weroha also recommends newly diagnosed patients ask their care teams if they are candidates for PARP inhibitors, mirvetuximab or clinical trials. "PARP inhibitors and mirvetuximab are newer treatments that could influence the outcome of your overall treatment. Always ask about clinical trials because when ovarian cancer recurs, there is no treatment so good that we can stop looking for something better," he says. "There is a very realistic hope that if your cancer were to come back, we would have something better that we don't have today."</p>

"We know that 250,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer every year, and 40,000 women die from&nbsp;breast cancer each year. Our goal is to detect cancer early and improve the prognosis, so we reduce deaths from breast cancer."</p>



<p>She adds, “It is important to talk with your&nbsp;doctor about what age and frequency of mammogram screening is right for you. You may need additional imaging in conjunction with mammograms, based on your breast cancer risk."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has long recommended breast cancer screening begin at age 40.</p>



<p>Early detection and regular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>&nbsp;screenings are key to reducing death from breast cancer.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mammograms</a>&nbsp;remain the best tool available and have been shown to reduce deaths from breast cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Breast cancer screening options</h2>



<p>Traditional mammograms produce 2D images of the breast, while newer 3D mammograms, also called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/3d-mammogram/about/pac-20438708?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast tomosynthesis</a>, create 3D images. Many medical facilities now offer both for breast cancer screening.</p>



<p>3D mammograms help detect breast cancer and investigate issues like masses and pain.

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My mom had a pap smear recently, and the results came back as abnormal. After further testing, we were shocked when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She didn't have any symptoms. Now, her healthcare team is discussing surgery and medications. What should I know about her illness? As her daughter, should I be worried about myself? Most importantly, how I can support her during treatment?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> I commend you for finding ways to support your mom through her <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical cancer</a> diagnosis. Gathering reliable information about her illness and treatment is a great start.</p>



<p>Part of the reproductive system, the cervix connects the vagina to the uterus, also known as the womb. By collecting cervical cells (called the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap smear</a> after the scientist who pioneered the screening test in the mid-1900s), cancer can be detected even at an early stage.</p>



<p>While cervical cancer may cause symptoms of bleeding or pain, it often does not cause any symptoms, especially in early stages. That's why Pap smears typically are recommended every three years for women ages 21 to 65. For women who are 30 and up, Pap smears may be recommended every five years, combined with testing for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV infection</a>. Pelvic examination with assessment of the cervix and other gynecologic structures, such as the vagina, vulva, urethra, anus, uterus and ovaries, can be easily performed in years when a Pap smear is not due.</p>



<p>HPV is the most common cause of cervical cancer. It is a frequent viral infection transmitted sexually through skin-to-skin contact. To help protect from cancer in the future, an <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-protecting-kids-from-cancer-with-hpv-vaccine/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">HPV vaccine</a> is available for males and females starting at ages 9 to 11. The vaccine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for people ages 9 to 45.</p>



<p>Treatment for cervical cancer will depend on many factors. For early-stage cervical cancer, a surgery called a total <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/abdominal-hysterectomy/about/pac-20384559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hysterectomy</a> to remove the cervix and uterus may be considered. A hysterectomy may be performed through a cut in the lower part of the belly. Or a hysterectomy can be done through a cut in the vagina. Minimally invasive procedures, such as with robotic-assisted or laparoscopic surgery using long, thin surgical instruments passed through small cuts in the belly also are options.</p>



<p>However, removing the uterus means pregnancy no longer is possible. Some surgical procedures, such as a trachelectomy (cervix removal), can preserve the uterus and fertility options.</p>



<p>For cervical cancer that has advanced but has not spread to other parts of the body, chemotherapy and radiation — delivered internally, externally or both — are typically recommended.</p>



<p>Medications are available for advanced cervical cancer that is continuing, keeps coming back or has spread. Targeted therapy called bevacizumab&nbsp;often is used in combination with other medicines. For patients who test positive for PD-L1 — a type of protein that stops the immune system from attacking cancer — an immunotherapy called pembrolizumab also may be used.</p>



<p>So-called "second-line treatments," such as tisotumab vedotin-tftv, given after earlier treatments have been unsuccessful, also are available and showing improved overall response rate.</p>



<p>While all treatments have benefits and risks, these treatments hold promise for enhanced long-term outcomes for patients with advanced and recurrent cervical cancer.</p>



<p>No matter what treatment plan your mom pursues with her care team, you can help in a variety of ways, such as doing household chores like cooking or cleaning. Your mom may appreciate you going to her medical appointments to ask questions, take notes or be another person to process all the information.</p>



<p>Don't forget prevention measures to reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ask your healthcare team about an appropriate Pap test routine for you depending on your age and individual factors.</li>



<li>Consider the HPV vaccine. The HPV vaccine is approved by the FDA to age 45. Are you up to date on your vaccines?</li>



<li>If you are sexually active, practice safe sex by using condoms and limiting sexual partners.</li>



<li>If you smoke, work hard to <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-strategies-to-quit-smoking/">quit</a>. Your healthcare team can point you to a variety of resources to stop tobacco use. Research shows women who smoke are twice as likely to get cervical cancer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC</strong>: I have been diagnosed with a brain tumor and advised to have radiation therapy. I'm very nervous about this and the risks for me, my family and, potentially, another cancer diagnosis. Can you explain why radiation therapy could be right for me?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER</strong>: Radiation therapy has been used to treat cancer since the beginning of the 20th century. This type of treatment continues to be one of the most effective treatments for cancerous (malignant) and noncancerous (benign) brain tumors. How it is delivered — and the technology used — has continued to evolve and improve.</p>



<p>Most patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain tumors</a> receive one of two types of radiation: <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/radiation-therapy/external-beam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">external beam radiation</a>, in which the tumor is treated over the course of several weeks, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stereotactic-radiosurgery/about/pac-20384526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiosurgery</a>, in which patients receive a high dose of radiation in one to five treatments to destroy the tumor.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stereotactic-radiosurgery/about/pac-20384526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stereotactic radiosurgery</a> uses 3D imaging to target high doses of radiation to the tumor with minimal impact on surrounding healthy tissue. It is used in small cancerous and noncancerous tumors and can be delivered in a few ways:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brain-stereotactic-radiosurgery/about/pac-20384679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamma Knife</a>: A Gamma Knife is not a knife at all but rather many tiny beams of radiation focused on a tumor with extreme accuracy.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linear accelerator</a>: A linear accelerator aims high-energy beams to a precise point on the body.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491#:~:text=Proton%20therapy%20is%20beneficial%20in,spine%2C%20and%20many%20pediatric%20cancers." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proton beam</a>: Using positively charged particles in atoms, proton therapy is focused on the tumor; virtually none of the radiation exits beyond the tumor.</li>
</ul>



<p>Radiosurgery targets each tumor individually and helps to spare normal tissue from being treated with radiation.</p>



<p>When I speak to patients, I often highlight several advantages of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation therapy</a>:</p>



<p><strong>Radiation treatment plans are tailored to each patient.<br></strong>Radiation therapy is not one-size-fits-all. The volume, dose, type and duration of radiation are tailored to fit each person and their specific tumor. A treatment plan is designed that considers the size, location and type of your brain tumor. Radiation therapy can be used to treat brain tumors by itself or after surgery, to ensure that leftover cancer cells are destroyed.</p>



<p><strong>Better precision.</strong><br>Radiation therapy must be accurately delivered to successfully destroy the tumor and prevent the tumor from coming back. Improvements made over the years — including improved imaging to better target the tumor and align the patient during radiation treatment — allow us to minimize damage to surrounding tissues and organs. Today, the accuracy with which we can deliver the treatment is within millimeters, thus limiting excess exposure of healthy tissues to radiation.</p>



<p>Better precision has allowed for a newer approach in radiation therapy, known as <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/search/results?swKeyword=hypofractionated+radiation+therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypofractionated stereotactic</a> radiotherapy, which delivers high doses of radiation over two to five days to destroy the tumor.</p>



<p>For instance, larger brain tumors have been difficult to treat with radiosurgery as the risk of treatment increases with the size of the tumor. However, research has shown that if we spread that dose over two to five days instead of one day, the tolerance is better, and we can often achieve a more effective dose for larger tumors.</p>



<p>Though side effects from brain radiation vary, fatigue and hair loss are the most reported. However, most patients find they can continue their regular activities throughout treatment.</p>



<p><strong>Improved safety.<br></strong>A common misconception when patients hear the word radiation is that radiation will cause cancer. While that is possible, the risk of developing a second cancer from radiation is extremely low. Modern radiation therapy techniques have improved effectiveness and safety, and radiation oncologists continue to discover ways to limit exposure and reduce the risk of secondary cancers from radiation.</p>



<p>It is important to note that if a secondary cancer were to occur from radiation therapy, it would not likely develop until many years after radiation exposure. Also, the risk of developing secondary cancer decreases with time, according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/survivorship/long-term-health-concerns/second-cancers-in-adults/treatment-risks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>.</p>



<p>Another misconception is that radiation therapy can pose a risk to people around you. External beam radiation passes right through the body like an X-ray. Patients do not leave their treatments radioactive. You will not expose anyone to radiation by receiving this type of treatment.</p>



<p>Radiation therapy continues to evolve through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/radiation-oncology/sections/research/rsc-20188600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> conducted by Mayo Clinic and others. In addition to advances in machinery, imaging has improved to help guide more accurate radiation treatment for patients.— <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/peterson-jennifer-l-m-d/bio-20055474" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Jennifer Peterson, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

Food also can be a distraction. If you're worried about an upcoming event or stewing over a conflict, for instance, you may focus on eating comfort food instead of dealing with the painful situation. </p>



<p>Emotional eating often leads to eating too much, especially overeating foods that are sweet, fatty and high in calories. And this can sabotage your weight-loss efforts. </p>



<p>When negative emotions threaten to trigger emotional eating, try these nine tips to stay on track:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Keep a food diary.<br></strong>Write down what you eat, how much you eat, when you eat, how you're feeling when you eat and how hungry you are.

<p><em><strong>Editor's note:&nbsp;</strong>April is Esophageal Cancer Awareness Month.</em></p>



<p>Esophageal cancer accounts for only about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/esophagus-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1% of new cancer cases</a>&nbsp;in the U.S., far lower than rates in other parts of the world. However, survival rates are low because it is often found at a later stage when symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, worsening heartburn, coughing and hoarseness have begun.</p>



<p>Having precancerous changes in the cells of the esophagus, a condition called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/barretts-esophagus/symptoms-causes/syc-20352841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barrett's esophagus</a>&nbsp;is a risk factor for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esophageal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esophageal cancer</a>. Barrett's esophagus is caused by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a>&nbsp;(GERD), which occurs when stomach acid repeatedly flows back into the esophagus, irritating the lining of the esophagus.</p>



<p>Risk factors for&nbsp;Barrett's esophagus include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Having a family history of Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer.</li>



<li>Being male.</li>



<li>Being white.</li>



<li>Being older than 50.</li>



<li>Having chronic heartburn and acid reflux.</li>



<li>Being a smoker or former smoker.</li>



<li>Being overweight.</li>

<p></p>



<p>Esophageal cancer specialists recommend screening for Barrett's esophagus in people who have multiple risk factors. Screening involves a procedure called an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopy/about/pac-20395197?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endoscopy</a>. During an endoscopy, a healthcare professional passes a lighted tube with a camera at the end (endoscope) down your throat to check for signs of changing esophagus tissue.</p>



<p>Despite these recommendations, screening rates for Barrett's esophagus are low.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/iyer-prasad-g-m-d-m-s/bio-20054859?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prasad Iyer, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and researcher, is working to change that.</p>



<p>"We now have access to new, minimally invasive tools for Barrett's esophagus screening," he says. "However, there is a critical need to develop more accurate Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer risk assessment tools that can be easily used with electronic health record data."</p>



<p>Such tools would help healthcare professionals identify people most likely to benefit from screening.</p>



<p>To address this need, Dr. Iyer and a team of researchers developed and tested a tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the risk of&nbsp;Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer&nbsp;based on data from a large database of de-identified electronic health records. The results of their study were published in&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/ctg/fulltext/2023/10000/development_of_electronic_health_record_based.6.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology</a>&nbsp;in 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the study was conducted</h2>



<p>Dr. Iyer and his research team used an AI model developed based on de-identified&nbsp;electronic health records of 6 million Mayo Clinic patients to create a risk prediction tool that can determine&nbsp;Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer&nbsp;risk at least a year before diagnosis.</p>



<p>The risk prediction tool can be integrated with an electronic health record and, when appropriate, prompt a healthcare professional to consider screening a patient for Barrett's esophagus.</p>



<p>Based on clinical, endoscopy, laboratory and pathology notes in the electronic health records, the researchers identified 8,476 people with&nbsp;Barrett's esophagus, 1,539 people with&nbsp;esophageal cancer and 252,276 people in the control group. They then used these groups to develop predictive models for the risk prediction tool.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The study results</h2>



<p>The results of the study demonstrated that the tool's predictive models had a high level of accuracy:</p>



<ul>
<li>The tool predicted Barrett's esophagus with 76% sensitivity (proportion of samples correctly identified as negative), 76% specificity (proportion of samples correctly identified as positive), and an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUROC) of 0.84. AUROC is a metric used to measure the quality of predictions produced by an AI model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest quality.</li>



<li>The tool predicted esophageal cancer with 84% sensitivity, 70% specificity and an AUROC of 0.84.</li>



<li>The tool also identified known risk factors for Barrett's esophagus and esophageal cancer, as well as new risk factors to consider, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/triglycerides/art-20048186https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triglyceride</a>&nbsp;levels and electrolyte levels.</li>

<p></p>



<p>"This tool could be integrated into the&nbsp;electronic health record&nbsp;and combined with a minimally invasive (nonendoscopic) screening tool and used by healthcare professionals in primary care," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Iyer notes that more research is needed to clarify when healthcare professionals should recommend screening, as well as to clarify other details. "Testing this risk prediction tool in patients and assessing the tool's performance are important next steps," he says.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma is a type of cancer affecting glial cells, which connect nerve cells and support brain function.</p>



<p>"It tends to be a tumor that also tends to grow and invade the brain," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/quinones-hinojosa-alfredo-m-d/bio-20238939?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa</a>, a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic. "Sometimes it can be slow and steady, but it tends to grow very fast."</p>



<p>Despite significant advances in surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation technology, the prognosis of glioblastoma remains poor.</p>



<p>“The median survival of patients with the best therapies tends to be between 12 and 14 months,” says Dr. Quinones-Hinojosa.</p>



<p>There is no known cure for glioblastoma, but treatments may help slow the progression or help stabilize the quality of life. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/brain-tumor-stem-cell-research/overview?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a> is making strides, giving patients more options and hope.</p>



<p>“Research is crucial to find hope and healing on every corner of our operating room, in every corner of our laboratory, and to connect those two, ultimately, through our patients," says Dr. Quinones-Hinojosa.</p>
