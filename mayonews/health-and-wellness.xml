<p>During Thanksgiving, food often takes center stage at gatherings of friends and family. The focus is on turkey, pie and all the sides. But it also can challenge healthy eating habits.</p>



<p>Andrea Delgado, a Mayo Clinic dietitian, says that by paying attention to how much you eat and how often, you can make <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20047702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy food</a> choices during the holidays.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/nR-biL5MVSw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: The Mayo Clinic Minute</a></strong></p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:01) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/SCRIPT-MCM-Making-Healthy-Holiday-Food-Choices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Sit down. Enjoy your holiday meal, says Delgado.</p>



<p>"There's never an all-or-nothing approach in nutrition, you can still enjoy everything in moderation," she says.</p>



<p>Delgado says overindulging during the holidays can be a tipping point for some.</p>



<p>"Maybe now we have a new diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high cholesterol</a> or a new diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prediabetes</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> because, even though we only did it for a short period of time, it was enough that we were close enough to be diagnosed with these new conditions," she says.</p>



<p>One strategy includes weighing your options and making choices.</p>



<p>"Let's say I have a green bean casserole, which is filled with cream of mushroom and a lot of other ingredients, versus just a side of green beans. Your better option would be the green beans," she says.</p>

<p>But what about that pumpkin pie?</p>



<p>"We can still have a small wedge, but maybe we don't add the whipped topping or the additional toppings that we might add typically. It's not really cutting out entire foods. It's more how can we reduce the portion or what we add to those foods," says Delgado.</p>

<p>"Our goal is to transform the transplant practice for future patients. To do that, we are using technology and team science to look at ways to optimize donated organs, liberate patients from anti-rejection medications and enable donated organs to last longer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burcin Taner, M.D.</a>, director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Florida.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is celebrating the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of its first organ transplant, which was a kidney transplant from a living donor on Nov. 25, 1963. Today, Mayo Clinic is the largest integrated transplant center in the U.S. Mayo Clinic's transplant centers in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota combined have performed over 31,000 organ transplants.</p>

<p>"From the very beginning, organ transplantation has been exciting because it can allow a patient who has end-stage organ failure and who is extremely ill and suffering to get back to a normal life. We need to achieve that for more patients," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heimbach-julie-k-m-d/bio-20054676?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Heimbach, M.D.,</a> director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Minnesota.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality sound bites with Dr. Taner and Dr. Heimbach are available in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Name supers/CG: Burcin Taner, M.D./Transplantation Surgery/Mayo Clinic</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Julie Heimbach, M.D./Transplantation Surgery/Mayo Clinic</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p>Here are four promising ways transplant is changing:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Enabling more donated organs to be safely used.</strong></h2>



<p>New technology is helping ensure that more donated organs can get to the people who desperately need them. One of the biggest advances has been organ-perfusion systems. These mechanical devices enable donated organs such as lungs, hearts, kidneys and livers to remain viable outside the body for a longer period of time so that they can be used. It also allows surgeons to restore organs that would otherwise not be safe for transplantation. "Organ perfusion technology has helped us expand the donor pool and deliver lifesaving transplants to more and more patients, all while maintaining some of the best outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bashar Aqel, M.D., </a>&nbsp;director of Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Helping transplants last longer.</strong></h2>



<p>The average kidney transplant in the U.S. lasts 10 to 20 years, meaning transplant recipients are often faced with needing a second transplant. But what if those donated organs could last longer? Researchers are looking at ways to keep patients healthier so that these donated organs thrive longer. For example, one of the most common causes of kidney failure is diabetes, which is related to obesity. One innovative approach is to perform bariatric surgery ahead of the kidney transplant to reduce the chance of post-transplant diabetes. Efforts are also underway to improve how organs are matched with patients with the goal of minimizing the need for immunosuppression medication, which can have negative side effects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Identifying organ failure earlier.</strong></h2>



<p>The quicker someone is identified as being at risk for organ failure, the sooner they can begin to receive treatment in hopes of delaying â€” and potentially preventing â€” the need for a transplant. Researchers are exploring ways to identify subtle warning signs that this is happening earlier via artificial intelligence and biomarkers in the blood.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Bioengineering new organs.</strong></h2>



<p>It may sound like science fiction, but experts hope that one day there will be a way to engineer new organs using <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative medicine</a>. That would eliminate the uncertainty of organ donation and long waiting lists. Those efforts are still in the early stages.</p>



<p>While all of these potential advances offer hope, choosing to be an organ donor is a step people can take today to help save more lives. More than 103,000 people are on the waiting list in the U.S. for a transplant, according to the <a href="https://unos.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing</a>. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/living-donor-transplantation/overview/ovc-20545462?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Living donation</a> allows people to donate a kidney or part of their liver to someone in need. People also can <a href="https://donatelife.net/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">register</a> to become a deceased donor.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I'm pregnant with my first child, and I've heard a lot about pelvic floor changes during pregnancy and childbirth. I'm a bit worried and curious about what to expect. Can you explain these changes and offer advice on preparing for a healthy pelvic floor after pregnancy?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Pregnancy and childbirth are transformative experiences for a woman's body, affecting it in many ways. One of the areas that may be affected is the pelvic floor, which is the diaphragm of the pelvis. These muscles support the&nbsp;uterus, bladder, large intestine and rectum.</p>



<p>Often, these muscles are affected by pregnancy and childbirth, altering some of their vital functions. These can include fecal and urinary continence mechanisms and support of the vaginal walls and uterus. Less support can lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/pelvic-organ-prolapse-whats-going-on-down-there" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prolapse</a>, when organs shift within the pelvis. Trauma to the pelvic floor muscles and nerves also may result in pelvic pain symptoms occurring with or without sexual intercourse.</p>



<p>Here are some of the factors that can affect your pelvic floor during pregnancy and childbirth and how they can lead to pelvic floor disorders in the future:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Physical changes. </strong>About 50% of pregnant women experience symptoms of pelvic floor disorders even before childbirth. During pregnancy, women tend to gain weight â€” not just the baby's weight but also weight from the placenta, increased blood volume and an enlarged uterus. The extra weight increases strain on the pelvic floor muscles, resulting in an increased risk of urinary incontinence. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/constipation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354253?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Constipation</a><span style="font-size: revert;color: initial;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif"> is common during pregnancy, especially in the </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy/art-20046767?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third trimester</a><span style="font-size: revert;color: initial;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif">. The weight of the growing uterus and hormone changes can affect digestion, leading to infrequent or difficult passing of stools. Any related straining and stress can weaken pelvic floor muscles and nerves further.</span></li>



<li><strong>Hormonal changes. </strong>The body also undergoes significant hormonal changes during pregnancy that affect pelvic floor health. The placenta secretes the hormone relaxin to increase the flexibility of ligaments in the pelvis and soften the cervix. These changes are good because they prepare the body for birth. However, this can loosen the connection between the pelvis bones and lead to increased flexibility and instability.</li>



<li><strong>Medical and occupational history. </strong>Some women are more susceptible to pelvic floor disorders, and this risk increases with pregnancy. Women with a history of chronic constipation, connective tissue disorders or smoking are at increased risk. Women who are obese or have a history of repeated heavy lifting, either at work or through weight training exercises, also can be at increased risk.</li>
</ul>



<p>Labor and delivery are considered risk factors for pelvic floor disorders. Vaginal delivery, in particular, is regarded as the most significant risk factor. During childbirth, the pelvic floor muscles undergo tremendous stress, especially during the second stage of labor, when patients are actively pushing. This risk is increased with operative deliveries using vacuum or forceps.</p>



<p>Labor before a cesarean section delivery also increases a womanâ€™s risk for pelvic floor disorders.</p>



<p>Some women's pelvic floors are more resilient and able to recover quickly, while others may be more prone to lasting issues. Studies show that the more vaginal deliveries a woman has, the more likely she is to experience pelvic floor dysfunction.</p>



<p>It's important to remember that pelvic floor disorders are not a forgone conclusion during pregnancy. Just as pregnant women take prenatal vitamins and avoid alcohol to lower the risks of some congenital conditions, they can take steps to reduce the risk of pelvic floor disorders.</p>



<p>Regular exercise and eating a healthy diet are good for your baby and good for your pelvic floor as well. I also recommend that you consider attending <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/classes-and-events" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">birthing classes</a> before childbirth. Often, these include stretching and breathing exercises to help coordinate the diaphragm and pelvic floor muscles during delivery. Pregnancy yoga and perineal massage can help prepare your pelvic floor by improving the flexibility and stretchability of tissues to limit your risk of perineal injuries at delivery.</p>



<p>When done correctly, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/kegel-exercises/art-20045283?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kegel exercises</a> strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. About 40% of people don't perform a Kegel correctly the first time. A physical therapist can help you identify the correct muscles if you are uncertain or have questions.</p>



<p>Finally, talk with your OB-GYN and healthcare team about your concerns. They can recommend stretches and classes to prepare your pelvic floor for childbirth. <em>â€” </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/tarek-khalife-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Dr. Tarek Khalife</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato/services-and-treatments/obstetrics-and-gynecology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Mankato</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/new-prague/services-and-treatments/obstetrics-and-gynecology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>New Prague</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I'm reaching out because I'm in a tough spot. A close friend rode out Hurricane Ian in Florida last year and it seems to me that he's struggling now. He's angry and jumpy, while being numb to what's happening around him. He told me that he's not sleeping well, especially when another hurricane is in the news. Is it possible that he has PTSD from the hurricane? I'm not sure how to offer support without making him feel uncomfortable.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967">Post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, also called PTSD, doesn't just happen to characters on the screen. It's a normal, natural response to trauma and happens when the nervous system, which is designed to protect you from danger, gets stuck in the fight-or-flight response.</p>



<p>People may develop PTSD when they experience, see or learn about a shocking experience or event involving harm, threatened death or serious injury. Natural disasters, like experiencing the power and devastation of Hurricane Ian, can trigger PTSD.</p>



<p>In addition to natural disasters, other common events that cause PTSD symptoms include accidents, being threatened with a weapon, combat exposure, abuse or receiving a life-threatening medical diagnosis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PTSD symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Some people experience distressing symptoms for a short period after a traumatic event but get better with time and self-care. For others, the symptoms worsen over time and begin to interfere with daily activities and relationships.</p>



<p>Overall, PTSD symptoms usually are grouped into four categories:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Intrusive thoughts</strong><br>Recurrent and unwanted memories of the traumatic event can cause significant emotional distress or physical reactions. The person may experience nightmares or flashbacks, which is reliving the traumatic event again.</li>



<li><strong>Avoidance</strong><br>People with PTSD may avoid talking about the event or steer clear of places, activities or people that remind them of the event.</li>



<li><strong>Mood and thought disturbances<br></strong>This category of PTSD symptoms can mirror <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007">depression</a>, with people experiencing hopelessness, negative thoughts about themselves or others, detachment from loved ones, lack of interest in activities, emotional numbness and relationship difficulties.</li>



<li><strong>Reactivity</strong><br>These symptoms may include being easily startled, always on guard for danger and overwhelming feelings of guilt or shame. The person may be irritable or have angry outbursts. They could have trouble sleeping or concentrating and engage in self-destructive behaviors such as drinking too much or taking illicit drugs.</li>
</ul>



<p>It's important to note that some people may have a few PTSD symptoms but not enough for an official diagnosis of the condition. In these cases, treatment still can be helpful and can guide people toward self-care strategies and coping mechanisms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PTSD treatment</strong></h2>



<p>The good news for you and your friend is that PTSD is treatable, and many people manage it well or recover from their symptoms. Some protective factors are especially helpful during recovery, including having positive social support from friends like you.</p>



<p>PTSD treatment involves addressing both the physical and mental aspects of the condition. Treatment plans developed by a healthcare professional are tailored to meet the needs of each person.</p>



<p>Certain treatments calm the nervous system and help people regain control over their physical responses to triggers. These tactics help the person have an automatic physical response to tell their body that a perceived threat isn't accurate. Examples include grounding techniques, breath awareness and body-focused interventions. For example, short and shallow breaths can be signs of the nervous system reacting to a trigger. Through treatment, people can identify this reaction and learn to take slow breaths, which can calm the physical reactions.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Cognitive processing therapy</a> can help your friend identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs related to the hurricane. Other treatments, such as exposure therapy and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355973?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">eye movement desensitization and reprocessing</a> can help as well. Finally, medications may be helpful when used in combination with other treatment options.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Positive support</strong></h2>



<p>I encourage you to discuss your concerns with your friend. Focus on your observations of his behaviors before and after the hurricane. Listen without judgment and don't minimize his feelings. Suggest that he seek professional help to undergo a thorough exam and have his symptoms evaluated.</p>



<p>Finally, I recommend that you learn more about PTSD to get a grasp of what he is going through and why he may react the way he does. Remember that each person's reaction to a traumatic event is valid, and his trauma shouldn't be compared to another's as "better" or "worse."</p>



<p>PTSD isn't a sign of weakness. It's a normal response to traumatic events, like a hurricane in your community. With a combination of interventions and professional help, your friend can learn to manage his symptoms and regain control. <em>â€” <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jackie-richter-lpc"><strong>Jackie Richter</strong></a></em><strong><em>, Psychiatry &amp; Psychology, Mayo Clinic Health System,&nbsp;</em></strong><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse"><strong>La Crosse, Wisconsin</strong></a></em></p>

<p>"Look at the portion size. I think that is the most important," Dr. Al-Araji says. "In general, try to avoid processed food and rich, fatty food, and incorporate <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/beans-and-legumes/sls-20076082#:~:text=Beans%2C%20peas%20and%20lentils%20are,has%20more%20fat%20and%20cholesterol.?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulses</a>, greens, vegetables and fruit."</p>

<p>World Pneumonia DayÂ will be observed Sunday, Nov. 12. This is a day designated to raise awareness about pneumonia, promote interventions to prevent and treat pneumonia, and generate action to combat pneumonia.</p>



<p>Pneumonia causes more than 1 million hospitalizations and 50,000 deaths per year in the U.S., according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pneumonia/five-facts-you-should-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Lung Association</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pneumonia</a>&nbsp;is an infection that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/multimedia/pneumonia-and-your-lungs/img-20008863?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflames the air sacs</a>&nbsp;in one or both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/multimedia/chest-x-ray-showing-pneumonia/img-20005827?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lungs</a>. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.</p>



<p>Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people over 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems. For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, your age and your overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chest pain when you breathe or cough.</li>



<li>Confusion or changes in mental awareness in adults 65 and older.</li>



<li>Cough, which may produce phlegm.</li>



<li>Fatigue.</li>



<li>Fever, sweating and shaking chills.</li>



<li>Lower than normal body temperature in adults older than 65 and people with weak immune systems.</li>



<li>Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.</li>



<li>Shortness of breath.</li>
</ul>



<p>Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354210?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seek medical attention</a> if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus.</p>



<p>It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a healthcare professional:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adults older than 65.</li>



<li>Children younger than 2 with signs and symptoms.</li>



<li>People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system.</li>



<li>People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>



<p>To help prevent pneumonia:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Get vaccinated.</strong><br>Vaccines are available to prevent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/vaccines/art-20046750?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some types of pneumonia and the flu</a>. Talk with your healthcare team about getting these shots. The vaccination guidelines have changed over time so make sure to review your vaccination status with your healthcare professional even if you recall previously receiving a pneumonia vaccine.</li>



<li><strong>Make sure children get vaccinated.</strong><br>Healthcare professionals recommend a different pneumonia vaccine for children younger than 2 and for children 2 to 5 years old who are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease. Children who attend a group child care center also should get the vaccine. Healthcare professionals also recommend flu shots for children older than 6 months.</li>



<li><strong>Practice good hygiene.</strong><br>To protect yourself against respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your hands regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>



<li><strong>Don't smoke.</strong><br>Smoking damages your lungs' natural defenses against respiratory infections.</li>



<li><strong>Keep your immune system strong.</strong><br>Get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.</li>

<p>She says understanding potential triggers for atopic dermatitis is a start.</p>

<p>Triggers for atopic dermatitis or eczema can be internal and external. </p>



<p>"Any sort of stressor to the mind, to the nerves, to the skin or to the immune system can cause a flare of eczema," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>It could be daily stress, a food allergy or the jewelry you are wearing.</p>



<p>"Some people with eczema are sensitive to nickel, they may be sensitive to a preservative and a medication that they're using," she says.</p>

<p>Learning how to decrease your sensitivity or stress can help.</p>



<p>Dr. Davis encourages patients to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Practice mind-body exercises.</li>



<li>Get plenty of rest.</li>



<li>Stay hydrated.</li>



<li>Avoid smoking.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Practice a sensitive skincare routine.</li>
</ul>



<p>This includes daily baths or showers with mild soaps, and frequent moisturizing with a fragrance-free, dye-free and chemical-free lotion.</p>



<p>"They may need may need prescription medicines. Those can be available topically by a cream or an ointment or systemically by a pill or a shot. And then we may choose to do advanced therapy beyond that, such as patch testing," Dr. Davis says.</p>

<p>Uterine fibroids are the leading cause of women undergoing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3874080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hysterectomies</a>, leaving them unable to bear children.</p>



<p>Fibroids often are diagnosed in women between 20 and 40. They can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pain and infertility.</p>

<p>Fibroids are muscular tumors that grow in the walls of the uterus. In most cases, they're benign.</p>



<p>"Even small fibroids, depending on their locations, can cause menstrual irregularities or heavy menstrual periods," says Dr. Louie.</p>

<p>She says a newer, minimally invasive treatment called radiofrequency ablation effectively removes fibroids.</p>



<p>"This technology is really good for fibroids within the wall of the uterus because those traditionally would have required us to make an incision in the uterine tissue in order to remove and treat the fibroid," says Dr. Louie.</p>



<p>Doctors insert a needlelike device into the fibroid, sending radiofrequency heat waves to target fibroids.</p>



<p>"Using energy to break down the fibroid tissue, and that causes the fibroids to shrink and become less productive of symptoms," explains Dr. Louie.</p>



<p>Best of all, there's little to no downtime after the procedure.</p>



<p>"This is the fastest recovery time I think we can offer for treating fibroid-related symptoms," says Dr. Louie.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Uterine fibroid symptoms</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Pain during sex.</li>



<li>Pelvic pain or pressure.</li>



<li>Heavy or prolonged menstrual periods.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leapfrog Group's Hospital Safety Score</a> is updated and published twice a year. The score is based on 15 measures of publicly available hospital safety data, combined with 12 self-reported survey answers to produce a single safety score. A panel of patient safety experts developed the measures for the score.</p>



<p>The Leapfrog Group's survey assesses the status of many hospital practice areas, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Electronic medication ordering.</li>



<li>Staffing of ICUs by critical care medical professionals.</li>



<li>Structures and systems to provide a culture that supports safety.</li>



<li>Practices to monitor and maintain safe nursing workforce levels.</li>



<li>Monitoring proper hand hygiene techniques of staff who interact with patients.</li>



<li>Monitoring the use of barcode scanning of patients and medications when administering medications in the hospital.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Leapfrog Group is one of many groups that recognize Mayo Clinic as a top choice for patients. Mayo Clinic is the only healthcare organization that consistently ranks among the top providers nationwide regardless of the quality measure used.</p>

<p>Every day, people take more than 23,000 breaths that fill their lungs with 2,000 gallons of air. It's an automatic and essential function that most people don't think about â€” until that breathing becomes difficult.</p>



<p>Marie Hammes knows this feeling well. The 70-year-old West Salem, Wisconsin, resident was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COPD</a>, in 1996. This chronic inflammatory lung disease causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. She handled her condition without extra oxygen until 2008, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pneumonia</a>&nbsp;made breathing harder.</p>



<p>For the next 10 years, Marie used a stationary oxygen concentrator overnight at home and portable oxygen tanks when away from home. In 2018, a health insurance plan change led her to seek a new oxygen supplier. That's when she met Jaclyn Dunnum, a respiratory therapist and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/home-medical-equipment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Store</a>&nbsp;assistant manager in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/home-medical-equipment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Crosse</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting patient needs</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic Store is a convenient supplier of durable medical equipment for patients recovering at home from an illness or accident or managing a chronic health condition like COPD.</p>



<p>Jaclyn explains that getting necessary medical equipment can feel overwhelming and complicated. Usually, the need is triggered by a medical condition that can feel scary and affect daily activities.</p>



<p>"Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, 'I am going to go get oxygen' or 'I want a bed and a walker,'" she says. "It is our job to make life easier by providing patients some normalcy in needing medical equipment."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Store staff accomplish this by educating patients and their families about their options and helping them select the least intrusive, but most beneficial, equipment for daily living needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Helping Marie breathe easier</h2>



<p>After discussing the options with Jaclyn, Marie decided to continue using a stationary concentrator at night and switched to a portable oxygen concentrator for times away from home. She was happy with how the portable concentrator made it easier to navigate when away from home.</p>



<p>"A portable oxygen concentrator is a small device that she can carry in a shoulder bag or backpack that pulls atmospheric air into the unit and creates medical-grade oxygen," says Jaclyn. "This allows Marie to be safe outside her home and keep her blood oxygen levels at the appropriate level."</p>



<p>Marie primarily uses supplemental oxygen while venturing outside and each night during sleep.</p>



<p>"I would never be able to walk through an entire store without the portable. It has made my ability to move where I want to much easier," she says. "It keeps my brain working well too. The portable is so much nicer to take places because I used to run into everything with the tanks."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">No unimportant questions</h2>



<p>The support Marie feels extends beyond the equipment she has received. Over the years, she has learned that she can depend on Jaclyn to answer her questions quickly and compassionately, whether they are big or small.</p>



<p>"I never feel like I ask a stupid question. She takes it in and answers it â€” no problem."</p>



<p>That's an important part of the job says Jaclyn.</p>



<p>"Durable medical equipment can be hard to navigate if you don't know the questions to ask or who to ask. I would not be doing my job as a healthcare worker if I did not make sure she was safe and getting what she needed to be safe in her home."</p>



<p>Marie is grateful for this personalized attention.</p>



<p>"They have been wonderful with me. Ask any question, and they are more than willing to try to answer it. It truly helps to know that I have them to rely on if or when needed."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Celebrating every milestone</h2>



<p>There's little slowing down for Marie. Recently, she marked her 70th&nbsp;birthday with her typical month-long celebration.</p>



<p>"I think every year is a milestone and worth a party," she laughs. "Age doesn't bother me, and having my oxygen helps me to celebrate."</p>



<p>Her attitude inspires Jaclyn and the Mayo Clinic Store staff.</p>



<p>"Marie is so fun to work with. She's a busy lady, and I'm glad the equipment keeps her that way," says Jaclyn. "She advocates for herself, and our team will always support whatever she needs."</p>
