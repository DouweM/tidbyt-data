<p>Mayo Clinic researchers used a new approach to chemotherapy to more than double the typical survival rate for patients with stomach cancer and peritoneal metastasis, which is cancer that has spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity, according to a study published in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1245/s10434-023-14379-2?sharing_token=izzkP9mkEzSjWxeG7Xa9dFR9MmLxJfDmU1c3CqwK5f3wLUJQhSLmLagY2QEynd9jmkArmVywnDHLt0EcA8r2PM76wCtckV8vTgboUgXYD6HGWsZqNVRJ5kCkxmtcHBsF3rDL2hyp5moyFyBa8G0_AfEIc_Zkj6srGmyuHe95P4g=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annals of Surgical Oncology.</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stomach-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stomach cancer</a>, which is also called gastric cancer, is caused by an uncontrolled growth of cells that starts in the stomach. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease has spread beyond the stomach and a cure is less likely.</p>



<p>"We're seeing an increase in stomach cancer in younger people, and it tends to be more advanced," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grotz-travis-e-m-d/bio-20342285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Grotz, M.D.</a>, surgical oncologist. “Unfortunately, when stomach cancer spreads to the peritoneum, systemic therapy is the primary treatment, resulting in only one year to live on average. Our research team was determined to improve outcomes for these patients so they can have more time with their family and friends."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Grotz_Travis_E._14925036_202207141044.jpg" alt="Image of Travis Grotz, M.D." class="wp-image-385206" style="width:200px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Grotz_Travis_E._14925036_202207141044.jpg 640w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Grotz_Travis_E._14925036_202207141044-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Travis Grotz, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the study, the patients received cytoreductive surgery to remove all visible cancer tumors in the stomach and abdominal cavity, followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). During HIPEC, the abdominal cavity is bathed with hot chemotherapy drugs, in this case cisplatin and paclitaxel, for 90 minutes to kill any remaining microscopic cancer cells. Heating the chemotherapy drugs and administering them directly into the abdominal cavity allows for both a higher dosage and greater penetration of the chemotherapy, resulting in more cancer cells being destroyed than conventional treatment, say the researchers.</p>



<p>"The median survival for most stage 4 gastric cancer patients is around 13 months," says Dr. Grotz, who is lead author of the study. "By using this new combination of chemotherapy drugs during hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, more than half (55%) of our patients are still alive three years after surgery."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/HIPEC-illustration16x9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385327" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/HIPEC-illustration16x9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/HIPEC-illustration16x9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>The patients studied were ages 46-62 with stage 4 gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis. They received an average of seven cycles of chemotherapy prior to undergoing cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. After the procedure, the patients stayed in the hospital for around six days, with most patients having no complications. Of the patients who had complications, most were lower grade and didn't prolong their hospital stay.</p>



<p>Researchers followed the patients clinically with imaging and tumor markers every three to four months for the first two years and every six months thereafter. The one, two and three-year overall survival rates were 96%, 78% and 55%, respectively.</p>



<p>The research team is looking to improve those outcomes even further by performing similar procedures robotically to require smaller abdominal incisions. The goal is to decrease the length of hospital stays and complication rates and quicken recovery so patients can get back to enjoying their lives. Eventually, Dr. Grotz hopes to do the procedure even sooner after diagnosis to prevent the spread of stomach cancer to the peritoneum.</p>



<p>"People with gastric cancer are usually told they have no hope and no options. When I was a medical student, I was motivated to wholly understand the cancer, how to treat it to really make a meaningful impact and cure some of these patients or prolong their survival or help alleviate their symptoms," says Dr. Grotz. "Although we still have a long way to go, we've made some big strides and will continue to make progress to provide hope and healing for our patients."</p>

<p>Most kidney cancer is discovered at an early stage when the cancer is small and confined to the kidney.</p>



<p>"Many patients are diagnosed coincidentally by imaging of the abdomen with a small renal mass, and they have a lot of options," says Dr. Potretzke.</p>



<p>The surgical approach to kidney cancer has shifted over the years to preserving as much of the healthy kidney as possible. Mayo Clinic has adopted some of the most advanced techniques, such as use of robotics.</p>

<p>"There is a focus, when it's safe and feasible, to removing just the tumor and leaving as much of the normal kidney behind as possible. Doing so is associated with increased long-term kidney function," says Dr. Potretzke.</p>



<p>Another option is to perform an ablation.</p>



<p>"They (radiologists) can stick a series of needles into the tumor and freeze it, or microwave it to death, and destroy the tumor while maintaining the normal, healthy kidney. And there is a fair bit of evidence that, in the correct patient, each one of those strategies can be really successful," says Dr. Potretzke.</p>



<p>Because many kidney tumors found early are relatively low risk, a third option is to keep a close eye on it, which is called active surveillance.</p>



<p>"Not everyone is a suitable candidate, but for patients with smaller renal masses, the risks of treatment may actually outweigh the potential benefits," adds Dr. Potretzke.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new multicenter, international study suggests that people who have early-stage <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/03/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer-and-its-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triple-negative breast cancer</a> (TNBC) and high levels of immune cells within their tumors may have a lower risk of recurrence and better survival rates even when not treated with chemotherapy. The <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816923">study</a> was published today in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA).</p>



<p>TNBC is a breast cancer subtype that does not respond to drugs that target the estrogen receptor or the HER2 protein. It grows rapidly, is more likely to spread beyond the breast before diagnosis and is more likely to recur than other breast cancers. TNBC represents about 15% of all breast cancers and is more common in younger people and in women of African American, Hispanic and Indian descent. Immune cells, also known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, are naturally existing immune system cells that can move from the bloodstream into a&nbsp;tumor and&nbsp;can recognize and destroy cancer cells.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Slide2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-384966" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Slide2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Slide2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Slide2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Slide2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>This is a tumor from a patient where the immune cells, also known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TILs, (blue arrow) are attacking the cancer (yellow arrow). The study shows that patients with these findings had a good outcome, even when chemotherapy was not administered</strong>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"This is an important finding because it highlights that the abundance of TILs in breast tissue is a prognostic biomarker in people with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, even when chemotherapy is not administered," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20463845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> and first author of the study. "The study's findings may inspire future clinical trials to explore whether patients with a favorable prognosis (high TILs) can avoid intensive chemotherapy regimens."</p>



<p>"This meta-analysis confirms robustly the prognostic value of TILs that we have previously reported in TNBC patients treated with chemotherapy and expands it to patients treated without chemotherapy," says Sarah Flora Jonas, Ph.D., a statistician at <a href="https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en/oncostat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gustave Roussy</a> and co-first author of the study. "Future studies may allow the use of this biomarker along with standard clinicopathological factors to inform treatment decisions in TNBC patients."</p>



<p>"Of interest, the first report suggesting that an increased number of immune cells being associated with better prognosis in breast cancer patients was described by doctors at Mayo Clinic more than 100 years ago," says Roberto Salgado, M.D., co-chair of the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group; co-lead of the study; and pathologist from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia, and ZAS Hospitals, Antwerp, Belgium. "It took a global effort and a century later to reexamine this biomarker and bring it closer to application in patient care."</p>

<p>"TILs are not currently measured or reported in the routine examination of tissue samples of breast cancer," says co-senior author, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-00027285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>, a medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Erivan K. Haub Family Professor of Cancer Research Honoring Richard F. Emslander, M.D. "While prior studies have focused on measuring TILs in people treated with chemotherapy, this is the largest study to comprehensively demonstrate that the presence of TILs influences the natural behavior of breast cancer in people who have surgery and/or radiation with no additional medical treatment."</p>



<p>For this study, Mayo Clinic and Gustave Roussy researchers, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.tilsinbreastcancer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group</a>, led 11 additional groups to collect data on 1,966 participants with early-stage TNBC who only underwent surgery with or without radiation therapy but did not receive chemotherapy. The participants had been followed for a median of 18 years. The results showed that higher levels of TILs in breast cancer tissue were associated with lower recurrence rates among participants with early-stage TNBC.</p>



<p>"Five years after surgery, 95% of participants with small tumors, stage 1 TNBC, and whose tumors had high TILs were alive, compared to 82% of patients whose tumors had low TILs. Importantly, the breast cancer recurrence rate was significantly lower among patients whose tumors had high TILs," says co-senior author, <a href="https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en/oncostat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stefan Michiels, Ph.D.</a>, head of Oncostat team, Gustave Roussy, Inserm U1018, University Paris-Saclay. "With nearly 2,000 participants involved in the study, we have now assembled the largest international cohort across three continents of people with TNBC in which the primary treatment was surgery without chemotherapy."</p>



<p>"The results of this study could lead to a recommendation to include TILs in the pathology reports of early-stage TNBC worldwide, as it has the potential to inform clinicians and patients when they discuss treatment options," says Dr. Salgado.</p>



<p>Furthermore, this biomarker would only require a visual evaluation by a pathologist looking through a microscope, meaning there are no additional costs associated with identifying the presence of immune cells. This could be particularly beneficial to regions with limited resources, adds Dr. Leon-Ferre.</p>



<p>Most people with early-stage TNBC undergo chemotherapy either before or after surgery, including people with stage 1 breast cancer. Most people receive multiple chemotherapy drugs in combination, which can cause significant side effects. Currently, the main factors taken into consideration to determine the course of chemotherapy treatment for each person are the tumor size and the presence of lymph node metastases. However, the authors identified that the number of TILs further influences the risk of future recurrence.</p>



<p>The researchers plan to evaluate TILs as biomarkers in prospective clinical trials evaluating chemotherapy selection based on TIL levels. Ongoing efforts to conduct additional research with other potential biomarkers are underway.</p>

<p>Sylvester Pinckney is someone who knows a lot about teamwork. He was a star football player in high school and college; he and his wife, Sabrina, have raised a family together; and for more than 20 years, he has worked to promote the well-being of children throughout his community.</p>



<p>When Sylvester was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352638">follicular lymphoma</a> in 2016, he knew he would have a team supporting him.</p>



<p>"When you have the opportunity to continue to live and fight for your family and your children, you have got to do it," Sylvester says.</p>



<p>He went to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, just a few miles from his home. Sylvester's care team treated the lymphoma with an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/autologous-stem-cell-transplant/pyc-20384859">autologous stem cell transplant</a>, and his cancer went into remission for nearly seven years.</p>



<p>But in 2023, he began to feel fatigued and pain, which prompted him to visit his community physician. Tests determined that his lymphoma had recurred.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g3YKh8xZro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: CAR-T cell therapy helps man continue community advocacy</a></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="fluidEmbed"><iframe loading="lazy" id="videoid4g3YKh8xZro"  title="CAR-T cell therapy helps man continue community advocacy" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4g3YKh8xZro?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>"When Mr. Pinckney was evaluated, we worked very closely with his community oncologist in Jacksonville," <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kharfan-dabaja-mohamed-a-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20425931">Dr. Mohamed Kharfan-Dabaja</a> says. "He was found to be a good candidate for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy</a> (CAR-T cell therapy), and we all agreed that this was the best course of action."</p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy collects a patient's T cells, which normally help fight off infections, and genetically engineers them to identify and target cancer cells. Those cells are then infused back into the body.</p>



<p>"Cancer is a huge word," Sabrina says. "Thirty or 40 years ago, that was a death sentence word. But look where we've come from just (seven) years ago. CAR-T cell therapy was in its prototype stages, but who knew we'd walk this walk again and the prototype would address the very cancer that my husband has? That's a blessing within itself."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-384615" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Sylvester Pinckney prepares for an imaging test.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As he prepared for his infusion, Sylvester was comforted knowing his experience could help others understand and have confidence in the treatment.</p>



<p>"You're the person going through it, but you have others who can benefit from it," Sylvester says. "Through your journey, be able to have a voice and tell them it will be fine; trust the process and the science. And when you're a patient going through something like that, it is very important to have that family environment and family feel."</p>



<p>In the days, weeks and months after CAR-T cell therapy, Sylvester was monitored closely. He began to feel his strength and energy return. At 100 days posttreatment, his care team delivered the news: his cancer was in remission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I believe in the bells that ring here every day," Sabrina says. "I believe in the doctors just walking the halls every day. The nurses down to the beautification staff, everyone I've ever come in contact with here, it is more than a job — it's a passion."</p>



<p>Sylvester shares that sentiment. His passion to positively affect the community and ensure the well-being of young people continues. Sylvester adds that the collaboration among healthcare professionals at Mayo Clinic and the Jacksonville community gives him hope for the future and gratitude for the present.</p>



<p>"Having a treatment that can change lives in your hometown is powerful," Sylvester says. "For me to be able to go home and come back is a blessing. I thank God that CAR-T was an option for me. I'm very grateful, and we have a family that has been blessed."</p>

<p>"What's important about that is they are different biology and they're much more treatable, meaning they respond better to treatments, and they tend to have a higher cure rate. We're sort of treating those differently than how we treat some of the non-HPV cancers," says Dr. Price.</p>



<p>Surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20558359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a>&nbsp;options, but Dr. Price says it is better to reduce the risks of infection.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ways to help prevent head and neck cancer</strong></h2>



<p>"The big three: no smoking tobacco use, minimizing alcohol and then HPV vaccination," she explains.<br><br>"We know that smoking and alcohol are big risk factors for head and neck cancer if you do both. This increases your risk even more," says Dr. Price.</p>



<p>And she encourages eating a healthy diet.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hasadsri-linda-m-d-ph-d/bio-20514421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linda Hasadsri, M.D., Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;(they/them/she/her), began a Mayo Clinic fellowship in Clinical Molecular Genetics immediately after completing their training in Clinical Biochemical Genetics, they never imagined the genetic tests they were helping develop would be the very same tests that guided their life’s journey. But just after starting that fellowship, Dr. Hasadsri’s personal and professional worlds collided, giving them a dual role as both patient and physician.</p>



<p>Now the director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview/specialty-groups/laboratory-genetics/molecular-genetics-laboratory">Molecular Technologies Laboratory</a> in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology and proud mom to two sons, Dr. Hasadsri’s experiences provide a unique perspective on the quality of Mayo Clinic Laboratories testing, the importance of timing, and the implications of test results for the future.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“WHEN I SAY A GENETIC TEST IS THE BEST TEST OUT THERE YOU COULD GET FROM THE BEST PEOPLE, I KNOW IT FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE — I’M NOT JUST HYPING IT UP BASED ON SOME PERFORMANCE METRICS,” DR. HASADSRI SAYS. “I ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND COULD TELL YOU ALL THE THINGS A TEST DOES WELL AND WHAT INFORMATION IT CAN YIELD FOR YOU.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Back in 2012, Dr. Hasadsri was working through an intense laboratory fellowship. Newly married and pregnant, their life took an unexpected turn when they miscarried the pregnancy. The devastating event triggered a sequence of medical discoveries that saved Dr. Hasadsri’s life and placed them on a genetic testing track that enabled the family of their dreams.</p>



<p>“If that pregnancy and pregnancy loss had not happened, I would not have gotten my cancer diagnosis, I would not have been stage 3 — I would’ve been stage 4. Literally, that baby that never was saved my life.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Up close and personal with genetic testing</strong></h2>



<p>Despite their young age and having no known family history of cancer, Dr. Hasadsri was found to have stage 3 colorectal cancer.&nbsp; A sample of the tumor tissue underwent somatic testing (current&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/overview/616489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo ID: MCCRC</a>). Much to Dr. Hasadsri’s surprise, the results came back suggestive of Lynch syndrome, a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome, and a blood sample was submitted for follow-up hereditary testing (current&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/Overview/614572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo ID: LYNCP</a>). Advanced sequencing to detect gene variants related to Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of colon, endometrial, uterine, and other cancers, yielded no pathogenic variants.</p>



<p>The negative test result was the first of many Dr. Hasadsri has received in the past decade. Each result informing their choices and providing reassurance that nothing has been missed. Moreover, the ability to experience each existing and newly implemented oncology test in the lab has provided unique insight into what answers mean to patients.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“IT WAS AN UNREAL EXPERIENCE TO BE TRAINED ON THE TESTS THAT I MYSELF WAS EXPERIENCING — IT REALLY LEVELS UP YOUR LEARNING,” DR. HASADSRI SAYS. “WITH EACH NEW TEST OR TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS LAUNCHED, I WOULD HAVE IT BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO SEE WHETHER I HAVE A MOLECULAR EXPLANATION FOR THIS CANCER, EITHER HEREDITARY OR ACQUIRED, BECAUSE EITHER WAY I WOULD HAVE AN ANSWER THAT COULD HELP ME PREPARE OR PLAN MY LIFE ACCORDINGLY.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Navigating health challenges</strong></h2>



<p>For Dr. Hasadsri, the miscarriage marked the beginning of an ongoing testing journey. Just after the loss, blood testing revealed a hemoglobin level of five grams per deciliter (g/dL) of blood. The average hemoglobin in adult females is 12–15 g/dL.</p>



<p>“(My primary care physicians) were like, ‘This is not conducive to a successful pregnancy, and we need to get to the bottom of this,’” explains Dr. Hasadsri.</p>



<p>Due to a known family history of alpha-thalassemia, Dr. Hasadsri was sent to hematology to determine whether an underlying anemia was at play. While suspected hematologic culprits were being discussed, the hematology-oncology fellow performing the physical exam found an abdominal mass.</p>



<p>“The whole time I was feeling exhausted from what turned out to be anemia and having some abdominal pain after eating meals, I'd never even thought to examine myself,” Dr. Hasadsri says. “And then once I actually felt that area of my abdomen, I could definitely palpate it as well. I could push around it and feel my lymph nodes were enlarged too. And so that got me worried.<em>”</em></p>



<p>Although cancer was within the differential diagnosis, it was not something Dr. Hasadsri easily accepted. “I’m like, ‘maybe I just have really bad inflammatory bowel disease and my colon is just really angry and hardened from that.’”</p>



<p>CT imaging revealed the mass had penetrated two sections of the colon, causing internal bleeding and a low hemoglobin level. Neighboring lymph nodes were also enlarged. During a follow-up colonoscopy, part of the mass was removed and biopsied. Somatic tumor testing revealed features of Lynch syndrome, an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, but germline testing did not identify any causative genetic variants.</p>



<p>Female colon cancer patients who test positive for Lynch syndrome are at an increased risk of developing uterine, endometrial, endothelial, and gastric cancers, among others.</p>



<p>“If an individual with Lynch syndrome is diagnosed with colon cancer and has a uterus in place, we typically remove the uterus (hysterectomy), fallopian tubes, and ovaries at the time of colon cancer surgery, unless the individual has not completed childbearing,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wick-myra-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20054521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Myra Wick, M.D. Ph.D.</a>, Dr. Hasadsri’s OB/GYN and medical geneticist. “This reduces cancer risk and the need for additional surgeries in the future.”</p>



<p>The pending nature of Dr. Hasadsri ’s molecular test result at the time they were scheduled to undergo a hemicolectomy, combined with their knowledge that Lynch syndrome diagnosis can only be cemented through molecular genetic testing, empowered them to push back against the recommended surgical approach.</p>



<p>“I remember during the consent process before going into surgery, they were saying, ‘You have Lynch syndrome — we should remove your uterus and ovaries too,’’’ Dr. Hasadsri says. “And I was like ‘WAIT! I still want those, I’m not done with those yet.’”</p>



<p>So the uterus and ovaries stayed. But 75% of Dr. Hasadsri’s colon and more than 30 lymph nodes were removed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Defying the odds to build a family</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="226" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Right_After_Surgery-300x226.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385024" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Right_After_Surgery-300x226.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Right_After_Surgery.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Hasadsri rests in bed just after surgery to remove colon cancer.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>After the surgery, Dr. Hasadsri and their spouse, Vincent Pureza, M.D., Ph.D., faced another decision. Because the chemotherapy needed to target any lingering cancer cells would push Dr. Hasadsri into premature menopause and limit their ability to bear genetic offspring, did they want to undergo&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;fertilization and preserve embryos so they could one day try for the family they still hoped for?</p>



<p>In the end, the answer was yes. Thanks to a grant from the Livestrong Foundation, the couple successfully created and froze five embryos.</p>



<p>Immediately after the egg retrieval, Dr. Hasadsri began chemotherapy. Over the course of six months — all while still training as a Mayo Clinic fellow — they received 12 rounds of treatment.</p>



<p>“I was told that after chemo, you should probably wait at least a year before trying to get pregnant, because all of those harmful chemicals are still in your body. We don't know what effect they're going to have on the eggs, on a potential embryo, or pregnancy,” Dr. Hasadsri says. “And chemo definitely put me in menopause. But just to be safe I also went on birth control afterwards too, because I was like, I’m not going to take any chances.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Last_Round_of_Chemotherapy-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385025" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Last_Round_of_Chemotherapy-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Last_Round_of_Chemotherapy.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Hasadsri celebrates their final round of chemotherapy at Mayo Clinic.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But just one month after chemotherapy ended, the unimaginable happened: Dr. Hasadsri conceived naturally.</p>



<p>“My OB/GYN, who is also a medical geneticist, was happy but also a little freaked out. It was too soon,” Dr. Hasadsri says.</p>



<p>“It is always concerning when women become pregnant in the midst of cancer treatment,” Dr. Wick says. “We're not always sure if there will be implications for the pregnancy,” Dr. Wick says. “We don’t know if some of the treatment the patient is on currently or previously might affect fetal growth or be associated with congenital problems. So, Dr. Hasadsri’s pregnancy soon after chemotherapy placed them into a high-risk pregnancy category, where we monitor things more carefully, including the baby's growth.”</p>



<p>The pregnancy, however, was successful, and so was the delivery.</p>



<p>“And that's how my 7-year-old came into being,” Dr. Hasadsri says.</p>



<p>Three years later, after using the frozen embryos and enduring three pregnancy losses, Dr. Hasadsri had accepted their fate.</p>



<p>“It was like, OK, I guess one child’s enough, I’m perfectly happy to have this one miracle baby that I didn’t even think I would have,” they say. “But then I got naturally pregnant with my second at age 40. I feel very lucky.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Proactively managing diagnosis</strong></h2>



<p>Throughout their medical journey, Dr. Hasadsri has followed the screening and testing recommendations for individuals with Lynch syndrome, despite lacking a genetic diagnosis.</p>



<p>“Even though I still carry a Lynch syndrome diagnosis in my chart, it’s because they would rather err on the conservative side and make sure I am managed appropriately, which I am totally on board with,” Dr. Hasadsri says. “I’d rather be screened more often than less since, even if I were eventually found not to have Lynch, I still worry about my risk of a cancer recurrence.”</p>



<p>That translates into annual colonoscopies. Before having their second son, Dr. Hasadsri also received annual endometrial biopsies. Not long after the baby was born, Dr. Hasadsri underwent a hysterectomy and oophorectomy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“I’M GETTING TO NOT JUST WITNESS THE PROGRESS BEING MADE IN GENETIC TESTING OF TUMORS AND FOR HEREDITARY CANCER PREDISPOSITION SYNDROMES BUT GETTING TO PERSONALLY EXPERIENCE IT AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH IS INCREDIBLE,” DR. HASADSRI SAYS. “BY HAVING TESTING DONE, I GOT TO ACTUALLY SEE HOW IT PERFORMED AND WHEN THOSE TESTS BECAME CLINICALLY LIVE AND AVAILABLE TO ALL PATIENTS, I KNEW FROM TRULY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW FANTASTIC THOSE TESTS WERE.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the sensitivity and specificity of genetic sequencing have increased and genetic targets become more defined, it is possible that a genetic association with Lynch syndrome will eventually be discovered for Dr. Hasadsri. But to date, each new test has yielded negative results.</p>



<p>“I am definitely an example of how sometimes a negative result is just as powerful and just as relieving as a positive one,” Dr. Hasadsri says. “Or that it inches you a bit more toward closure. It's still very, very gratifying and satisfying because you're like, ‘OK, that's just one more piece of evidence that it's probably not something that I inherited or that my kids could inherit from me.’”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Translating experience into action</strong></h2>



<p>While Dr. Hasadsri’s interest in genetic testing evolved long before their personal journey intersected with hereditary cancer testing, the experience has fueled their passion.</p>



<p>“Just recently we had an example of a potentially difficult diagnosis with a pregnant patient, it was a condition that is tested for in our laboratory, and Dr. Hasadsri really went the extra mile to test additional family members and send tests kits out,” Dr. Wick says. “I think that is just part of their personality and how they function, and illustrated meeting the needs of the patients and going all out to make sure that happens.”</p>



<p>Having felt the many emotions that correspond with cancer testing, Dr. Hasadsri understands deeply what is at stake for patients seeking answers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“EVERY PATIENT DOES HAVE A LAB TEST AT SOME POINT, AND SO I THINK THAT LABORATORY MEDICINE AND PATHOLOGY IS ESPECIALLY RELATABLE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE FIELD,” DR. HASADSRI SAYS. “BUT IN MY CASE, I FEEL LIKE IT WAS EXTRA REAL BECAUSE I WAS THAT PATIENT GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS ANXIOUSLY WAITING. IF IT’S AT THE END OF THE DAY AND YOU’VE GOT AN EXTRA CASE, FOR INSTANCE, YOU WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO GET THE CASE OUT, EVEN THOUGH IT’S STILL WITHIN TURNAROUND TIME AND COULD WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY, YOU DON’T BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE THAT PATIENT. BECAUSE YOU WERE THAT PATIENT.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"The entire spirit of doing the colonoscopy prep is to make sure that there is nothing in the colon," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<p>That's so your medical team can detect and remove&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-you-need-to-know-about-polyps-in-your-colon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polyps</a>&nbsp;or lesions.</p>



<p>"We frequently hear that the colon preparation can be a challenge," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to start bowel prep</h2>



<p>Review your prep guidelines one to two weeks before your procedure for any special instructions. You may be encouraged to make small changes in your diet starting a week before the procedure.</p>



<p>Often, the day before the colonoscopy is when you'll start the bowel prep solution. Dr. Ebner says this is where people may struggle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for taking bowel prep solution</h2>



<p>"There's a couple of tricks. Often, cooling the solution and drinking it through a straw can be helpful.&nbsp;Others like to have a small lime or lemon wedge that they just bite into after doing some of the solution," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<p>Chewing gum between sips of the solution also may help. And he says taking the solution is often spread out over two days, and that can help too.</p>

<p>"Half of the volume is done the day before the procedure, the other half is done the day of the procedure. That helps make it a lot more tolerable.&nbsp;And, in fact, we get a better cleanout by doing that splitting," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Ebner says some adnominal cramping, bloating, discomfort or nausea during the bowel preparation is normal. "For those that do have nausea, slowing down how fast you're consuming the fluid can oftentimes be really helpful," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carole Reisinger’s body was telling a story that nobody would ever want to hear.  </p>



<p>"It started last February when I was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney cancer</a>. Thanks to the medical staff at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>, five days later, I had a 9-by-5-centimeter tumor removed," says Carole Reisinger.</p>



<p>But it was during that surgery, the second story was about to be told.</p>



<p>"In the process of that surgery, the surgeons noticed my colon was inflamed and had a thickening of the wall.&nbsp; After speaking with the physicians a few days later, they proposed that I should get a colonoscopy done," the Warrens, Wisconsin, native adds.</p>



<p>After recovering, she took her physician's words to heart, and did the colonoscopy. It's something she says she should have done sooner.</p>



<p>"I had been having some signs of something wrong. My stomach had been crampy, and I did have blood in my stool at times," explains Reisinger.</p>



<p>In April, she was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884">rectal cancer</a>. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Morris-Andrew-D._30069560_202109131025-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-384770" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Morris-Andrew-D._30069560_202109131025-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Morris-Andrew-D._30069560_202109131025.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Andrew Morris, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Rectal cancer is a subset of colon cancer that is located at the final segment of your colon. Symptoms of bleeding and irregular bowel habits are common. Colon cancer begins when healthy cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. These changes unfortunately can also be hereditary," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/andrew-morris-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Morris, M.D</a>., <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/colon-and-rectal-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal and rectal surgeon</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse</a>. "Cancer inside the rectum (rectal cancer) and cancer inside the colon (colon cancer) are often referred to together as colorectal cancer."</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a> is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and the fourth-leading cause in women. The lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women.</p>



<p>The 64-year-old had to battle her second cancer in a matter of months. For the next six months, Reisinger would go through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> and then radiation treatments at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/oncology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse</a>. In January of 2024, Dr. Morris and his surgical team removed the cancer, including most of the rectum.</p>



<p>"Advances in surgery have allowed colon and rectal cancers to be removed in a minimally invasive (small incision) fashion, often using the da Vinci robotic surgical system. Mrs. Reisinger was able to have the cancer completely removed, including the lymph nodes, and her colon reattached. Her recovery was generally quick due to the minimal pain related to the small incisions," Dr. Morris says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/rectal-bleeding/basics/causes/sym-20050740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Signs and symptoms</a> of rectal cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li>A change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation or more-frequent bowel movements.</li>



<li>Dark maroon or bright red blood in stool.</li>



<li>Narrow stool.</li>



<li>A feeling that your bowel doesn't empty completely.</li>



<li>Abdominal pain.</li>



<li>Unexplained weight loss.</li>



<li>Weakness or fatigue.</li>
</ul>



<p>In some families, gene mutations are passed from parents to children increasing the risk of colorectal cancer. One in 3 people who develop colorectal cancer have other family members who have had it. Reisinger wasn't one of them.</p>



<p>"I know of no family history of colon cancer," she says. "After I was diagnosed, we did genetic testing, and that also came up with nothing. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones."</p>



<p>Besides family history, there are other factors that can lead to colon cancer:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Older age.</strong>&nbsp;Colorectal cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but most people with this type of cancer are older than 50. The rates of colorectal cancer in people younger than 50 have been increasing, but doctors aren't sure why.</li>



<li><strong>African American descent.</strong>&nbsp;People of African ancestry born in the U.S. have a greater risk of colorectal cancer than do people of European ancestry.</li>



<li><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease.</strong>&nbsp;Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon and rectum, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, increase your risk of colorectal cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Eating a diet low in vegetables.</strong>&nbsp;Colorectal cancer may be associated with a diet low in vegetables and high in red meat, particularly when the meat is charred or well-done.</li>



<li><strong>Too little exercise.</strong>&nbsp;If you're inactive, you're more likely to develop colorectal cancer. Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Diabetes.</strong>&nbsp;People with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Obesity.</strong>&nbsp;Obese people have an increased risk of colorectal cancer when compared with people considered at a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Smoking.</strong>&nbsp;People who smoke may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Drinking alcohol.</strong>&nbsp;Regularly drinking more than three alcoholic beverages a week may increase your risk of colorectal cancer.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/colorectal-cancer/statistics#:~:text=For%20rectal%20cancer%2C%20the%20overall,relative%20survival%20rate%20is%2074%25." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recent research</a> shows the overall five-year relative survival rate for people diagnosed with rectal cancer is 68%. If the cancer is diagnosed at a localized stage, the survival rate is 90%. If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues, organs and/or the regional lymph nodes, the five-year relative survival rate is 74%.</p>



<p>"The advances in chemotherapy, immunotherapy and surgical techniques are improving these survival rates in both rectal and colon cancer. Thankfully, the multiteam approach that is provided at Mayo with these cancers makes sure all treatment options and even study protocols are being used. Early detection is key though, as it gives the best chances for a cure," states Dr. Morris.</p>



<p>Reisinger's outlook is good. She can't thank the surgeons, physicians and medical staff at both Mayo Clinic in Rochester and Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse enough for helping her through both medical situations.</p>



<p>She does point out that all women (and men) should take responsibility and control of their own healthcare now and not wait until it's too late.</p>



<p>"My advice is to not put off a colonoscopy," says Reisinger. "Start at the age of 45 and begin paying attention to your body. Pay attention to your own bowel movements. They are a tattletale to your health."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While kidney cancer is rare in children, Wilms tumor is the most common type found in kids, with between&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/wilms-tumor/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500 and 600 children</a>&nbsp;diagnosed annually in the U.S. The disease most often affects kids ages 3 to 4.</p>



<p>Thanks to advances in treatments over the past several decades, survival rates from this rare cancer have improved significantly. Developing a treatment plan customized for each child with Wilms tumor has also helped to improve the prognosis for children with this disease. "Every Wilms tumor is different — in size, location, complexity, and whether it has spread to other organs," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/polites-stephanie-f-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20506073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephanie Polites, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric surgeon. "Having a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals who can develop an individualized care plan for each child is key."</p>



<p>Here's what families should know about treatment for this rare childhood cancer:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A team approach is best</strong></h2>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, treatment for Wilms tumor is planned by a team of healthcare professionals from multiple specialties. "From the moment a child is diagnosed with a kidney tumor, our team meets to discuss the plan of attack," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/granberg-candace-f-m-d/bio-20055572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Candace Granberg, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric urologist.</p>



<p>Dr. Granberg is part of the pediatric solid tumor team at Mayo Clinic, which includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pediatric oncologists: Doctors who specialize in treating children and young adults who have cancer.</li>



<li>Radiation oncologists: Doctors who specialize in treating cancer with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation therapy</a>, a type of cancer treatment that uses beams of intense energy — X-rays or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protons</a>&nbsp;— to kill cancer cells.</li>



<li>Pediatric radiologists: Doctors who specialize in using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/radiology/sections/overview/ovc-20469630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imaging technology</a>&nbsp;to diagnose and treat children with various conditions.</li>



<li>Pediatric surgeons: Doctors who specialize in performing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20475393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surgery</a>&nbsp;in children.</li>



<li>Pediatric&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/urology/sections/overview/ovc-20336015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urologists</a>: Doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating problems involving the male and female urinary tract and the male reproductive organs in children.</li>
</ul>



<p>This team meets to review the needs of each child with Wilms tumor and determines the first step for treatment. "We coordinate care to streamline appointments and procedures to minimize the frequency of trips families must take," says Dr. Granberg.</p>



<p>Before starting treatment, your child's care team will determine if cancer treatment could affect the child's future fertility. If so, they offer the family options for&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/02/15/planning-for-tomorrow-fertility-preservation-and-childhood-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fertility preservation</a>. These options will depend on a child's age, puberty stage, diagnosis and proposed treatment plan. At Mayo Clinic, procedures to preserve fertility are integrated with other treatment procedures or imaging scans whenever possible to minimize a child's exposure to anesthesia.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Surgeons need expertise in complex procedures</strong></h2>



<p>Treatment for Wilms tumor may begin with surgery to remove all or part of a kidney. At Mayo Clinic, pediatric radiologists construct life-size,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/anatomic-modeling-laboratories/overview/ovc-20473121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anatomic 3D models</a>&nbsp;of the Wilms tumor and surrounding structures to help with surgical planning. This approach is useful in challenging circumstances, such as removing only the part of the kidney containing the tumor (partial nephrectomy) or removing multiple tumors from one kidney.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/06/a-medical-illustration-of-a-child-with-a-Wilms-tumor-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of a child with a Wilms' tumor" class="wp-image-165822" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/06/a-medical-illustration-of-a-child-with-a-Wilms-tumor-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/06/a-medical-illustration-of-a-child-with-a-Wilms-tumor-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>Treatment often involves the surgical removal of the entire kidney and nearby lymph nodes through an incision in the abdomen. Given the substantial size of many Wilms tumors and their proximity to vital structures and organs, your child's pediatric surgical team needs to specialize in complex abdominal operations for children to ensure the best outcomes.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a tumor will extend into major blood vessels, and the approach requires the assistance of vascular surgeons who specialize in treating circulatory system diseases. "We are blessed at Mayo Clinic to have these specialists right down the hall from our pediatric operating rooms. They bring their entire team to our room and either reconstruct the major vessels or place grafts if needed," says Dr. Granberg. "These are procedures they do all the time, so having them there for these rare cases in kids is necessary for a successful surgery."</p>



<p>Chemotherapy can be used before surgery to shrink tumors and make them easier to remove. After surgery, it can kill cancer cells left in the body. Chemotherapy may also be an option for children whose cancers are too far along to be removed completely with surgery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New technology and research continue to improve treatment.</h2>



<p>Radiation therapy may also be used to treat Wilms tumor. Radiation therapy most often uses X-rays to beam intense energy to kill cancer cells.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proton beam therapy</a>, another important advancement in caring for children with Wilms tumor and other childhood cancers, may also be used. This highly targeted precision beam therapy destroys cancer while sparing healthy tissue. It's an important component of the treatment plan for children, as it prevents damage to developing organs and reduces long-term complications, side effects and secondary malignancies.</p>



<p>Research on Wilms tumor is ongoing, and Mayo Clinic researchers are studying new ways to treat this rare cancer. "Though a cure is possible in the majority of cases, we need to do better — we want to cure everyone," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/gargollo-patricio-c-m-d/bio-20211382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patricio Gargollo, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric urologist.</p>



<p>Dr. Gargollo and his colleagues recommend seeking a children's cancer center with experience treating Wilms tumors. With the right care team, children with Wilms tumor can have excellent outcomes.</p>

<p>Sally Blackwell&nbsp;was pregnant with her second child when she began noticing symptoms she initially brushed off as nothing.</p>



<p>She was experiencing constipation. She wasn't gaining weight during the pregnancy. She figured the lack of weight gain had to be because she wasn't doing the daily Chick-fil-A runs she did during her first pregnancy.</p>



<p>It wasn't until after her daughter was born in May 2021 that the symptoms became so severe they were impossible to ignore any longer.</p>



<p>She had a distended abdomen, "pencil-thin stools," and was in so much pain she found it difficult to sit.</p>



<p>She felt an abnormal growth and was told it was probably hemorrhoids by one physician. She saw another physician when the pain became unbearable and was told the same thing.</p>



<p>By this time, Blackwell says she was unable to eat much and her energy levels were dipping, and that wasn't a good thing with an infant at home. She began to feel desperate and scheduled an appointment with a local colorectal surgeon.</p>



<p>That's when she learned what she wasn't prepared to hear. She had a 5-centimeter mass that was later confirmed to be stage 3&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rectal cancer</a>.</p>



<p>She was 33.</p>



<p>"As soon as I learned about the tumor, I knew I wanted to be treated at Mayo Clinic," Blackwell says.</p>



<p>Her experience receiving cancer care at Mayo Clinic in Florida was so positive she decided she wanted to be a part of the organization.</p>



<p>Now a Mayo Clinic social worker, Blackwell shares more about her healthcare journey with&nbsp;<a href="https://intheloop.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the Loop</a>&nbsp;and what inspired her to join the Mayo team:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When did you come to Mayo Clinic for care?</h2>



<p>At the time, I was working at another area hospital. I had a friend,&nbsp;Samantha Inabinett, who I used to work with and knew I could confide in, who happened to work at Mayo Clinic in the GI Oncology clinic. I remember reaching out to her via text, and she immediately said, "I am here for you for whatever you need."</p>



<p>In a serendipitous turn of events, I had also been in a support group online of moms with children. Through that group, I made friends with another mom, Natasha, who also happened to be in the GI Oncology department at Mayo Clinic at that time. I reached out to her as well, and she also immediately flooded me with the support and knowledge I needed. They helped me navigate the Mayo system to get appointments set up.</p>

<p>On Nov. 15, 2021, I met&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jones-jeremy-c-m-d/bio-20469882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jeremy Jones</a>&nbsp;in Oncology. Quickly, MRIs, CTs and bloodwork were taken to confirm my diagnosis.&nbsp;On Nov. 18, 2021, I had my first chemotherapy treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My treatment plan started with a few months of chemotherapy, followed by radiation and then a life-changing surgery including an abdominoperineal resection&nbsp;(removal of the anus, rectum and distant colon), permanent colostomy and hysterectomy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What do you remember most about your experience at Mayo Clinic?</h2>



<p>I remember the kindness of all the staff — from the people who greeted me when I checked in, the medical assistants who took my labs and roomed me, the housekeeping staff and all the providers. Everyone took a general interest in my health and well-being.</p>



<p>I remember feeling so impressed with how efficiently appointments were scheduled so that my treatments could stay on track. When your life is in the hands of someone else, it is such a reassuring feeling to know that appointments are being scheduled quickly.</p>



<p>I can remember coming to my appointments with questions written on paper, and nobody I met ever batted an eye. I never felt like an inconvenience.</p>



<p>I remember meeting with the wound care nurse, Melanie, in the Colorectal Surgery Department before having my colostomy surgery. I had a full page of the most random questions, and she indulged me in answering every single one of them.</p>



<p>For me, having a colostomy was going to be life-changing, and I wanted to feel prepared. I would no longer be able to pick up my children, and I wanted to make sure I embraced every moment of life I possibly could. She showed me examples of all the supplies I would be using and how to use them. She even sent me home with an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/ostomy/art-20045825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ostomy</a>&nbsp;bag to try out before my life-changing surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What would you like other patients who are going through a similar experience to know?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, I want all patients and staff to know the warning signs of <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/category/cancer-type/colorectal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a>. The more we spread awareness of the signs, the more likelihood there is to save lives.</p>



<p>Colorectal cancer diagnoses are on the rise, especially in <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/03/19/youre-at-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-know-the-symptoms-get-screened/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">young people under 50</a>.</p>



<p>If you have symptoms, tell your doctor and don't be scared of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopy</a>. The prep is no fun — I will admit that — but it is necessary for treatment, and issues can be resolved before it progresses to cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am actively involved in many of the online&nbsp;<a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/group/colorectal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer support groups</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/group/ostomy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ostomy support groups</a>. I want other patients to know that you are not alone. It is sometimes an isolating diagnosis to have colorectal cancer because it's taboo to talk about bowel habits.</p>



<p>Find your support network whenever you feel comfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What inspired you to look for work at Mayo Clinic?</h2>



<p>I owe my whole life to Mayo Clinic. My ability to tuck my kids in bed at night, go on dates with my husband, and take long walks dreaming and planning for the future, and my ability to celebrate holidays, birthdays and milestones with my family is all because Mayo Clinic saved my life.</p>

<p>I had my life-changing surgery in April 2022 with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merchea-amit-m-d/bio-20055739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Amit Merchea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dinh-tri-a-m-d/bio-20055484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Tri Dinh</a>.</p>



<p>After I recovered from surgery and some time had passed when I was cancer-free, I had the urge to see if there were any clinical social work positions available at Mayo Clinic. To my surprise, there were. I interviewed and was offered a position.</p>



<p>I started in November 2022 as a social worker in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liver Transplant</a>&nbsp;department. One of my favorite parts of my role is the opportunity to work with cancer patients on their journey to remission. I also meet other people with ostomies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What has been your experience working at Mayo?</h2>



<p>I have absolutely loved working at Mayo Clinic, and my personal experience has positively influenced how I relate to my patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I recently joined the Disability Mayo Employee Resource Group and hope to connect further with other disabled co-workers working in healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does your experience as a patient influence the way you work?</h2>



<p>As I approach the two-year cancer-free mark, it reminds me that it has been a while since I lost sleep wondering if I would be able to watch my children grow up.</p>



<p>It also has been a while since I had to juggle chemotherapy and radiation schedules with my work and life schedule. It has been a while since I had to hold my breath when opening my Mayo app to see my lab results. It has been a while since I counted the tiles in a treatment room. It has been a while since I got sick from treatment, had to wear gloves due to cold sensitivity from chemotherapy, or slept the whole day away.</p>



<p>It has been a while since cancer consumed every thought and conversation I had. It has been a while since I obsessed over recurrence rate statistics and searched the internet for other stories like mine.</p>



<p>Even though it has been some time, those experiences are part of who I am, and I remember them when I meet with patients at Mayo Clinic. It reminds me that while Mayo Clinic is a medical setting, a lot of life happens inside these walls and in our communities.</p>



<p>It is important to take care of the whole person — emotionally, spiritually, etc. — and that is why social workers are so important in the medical setting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How has the experience influenced your future career path?</h2>



<p>I no longer watch life happen from the sidelines. I no longer track time based on the next holiday or birthday, wondering if it will be my last. Although time continues to move forward on my cancer journey, if I close my eyes, it really does feel like yesterday.</p>



<p>My experience has solidified that I am committed to working at Mayo Clinic until the day I retire. Even then, hopefully, I can come back as a volunteer.</p>



<p>People often read about a mission for an organization and don't think about it too much. For me, "inspiring hope" is part of who I am now because Mayo Clinic inspired hope in me, and I just want to be able to do the same for others.</p>
