<p>The most common form of primary <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver cancer</a> — cancer that starts in the liver — is called hepatocellular carcinoma. This type of cancer often develops in people with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis.</p>



<p>"It’s due to a chronic inflammation that leads to liver damage, cirrhosis and eventually to cancer," says Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of liver cancer" class="wp-image-174281" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<p>Most people don't have symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. But when symptoms do appear, they may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Yellowing of the eyes and skin.</li>



<li>Unexpected weight loss.</li>



<li>Upper abdominal pain.</li>



<li>White, chalky stools.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Liver cancer treatments</h3>



<p>Several promising treatments to manage the disease include targeted therapy and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>"Immunotherapy is kind of a novel type of cancer treatment that is designed to boost your immune system to attack the cancer," explains Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>



<p>Eating a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables, limiting alcohol consumption, and getting vaccinated against hepatitis B can reduce your risk of liver cancer.</p>



<p>"The hope is that we can trigger a tumor specific immune response for every patient,” says Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2020, Gary McCracken noticed a swollen lymph node near the upper left side of his neck. He initially didn't think much of it. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"I grew a beard for deer season and forgot all about it," he says with a chuckle.</p>



<p>After Thanksgiving, when Gary shaved his beard, the gland was still swollen. "There's a video of me playing guitar at church, and it looks like I swallowed a baseball," he says.</p>



<p>That's when the Hayward, Wisconsin, resident decided to get checked out.</p>



<p>"I went into the local clinic. The doctor who examined me said it was probably nothing, but I should have a biopsy to be sure," Gary says.</p>



<p>He was sent for a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/needle-biopsy/about/pac-20394749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">needle biopsy</a>. When that biopsy uncovered suspicious cells, Gary was referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist in Duluth for further investigation.</p>



<p>"The ENT said, 'You know, you don't need that gland, so let's just take it out,'" Gary says.</p>



<p>Gary agreed. On Feb. 17, 2021, he had the lymph node removed. Two days later, he received a call that made it clear he was not out of the woods and ultimately would need more specialized care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sharing the news, keeping his faith</strong></h2>



<p>"The doctor said, 'I didn't think I was going to say this, but you have cancer somewhere in your body, and the cells have gotten into your lymph system and shown up in this gland,'" Gary recalls of the day he received the follow-up call.</p>



<p>Despite the heart-wrenching news, Gary put on a brave face for his wife of 42 years and his five children.</p>



<p>"I tried to downplay my diagnosis to my family and say it's not that big of a deal, but we're a close family, and we walked through it together," he says. "I'm also a person of faith, so that carried me through."</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

</blockquote>



<p>Encouraged by his family and his faith, Gary continued to stay positive while he underwent more testing to try to identify the source of the cancer.</p>



<p>His local care team was unable to locate the cancer with imaging. So they sent him to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a> for further examination.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Experiencing the Mayo Clinic magic</strong></h2>



<p>Gary remembers the moment he arrived at Mayo Clinic. Navigating the vast campus seemed daunting initially, but he quickly learned what makes Mayo Clinic magical:&nbsp;<em>the people.</em></p>



<p>"The people there are so helpful. It's just so astounding how accommodating they are to go out of their way to help visitors navigate and feel at ease," Gary says. "It makes for such a positive and wonderful experience from the minute you walk in."</p>



<p>But Gary's gratitude for Mayo Clinic extends far beyond the warm welcome he received when he got to campus. Specialists worked together to uncover the source of Gary's cancer and treat it.</p>



<p>Gary was seen by the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (ENT) Oropharynx Multidisciplinary Clinic team, including specialists in medical oncology, radiation oncology, dentistry and speech therapy, within one day of arriving at Mayo Clinic. Then he went to the operating room where <a href="https://quarterly.mayo.edu/directory/person/person.htm?per_id=11437456&amp;search_criteria_display=%27Moore%27+%27Eric%27+">Eric Moore, M.D.</a>, chair of Otorhinolaryngology, and supervisor-physician assistant Eliot Martin, performed exploratory robotic surgery.</p>



<p>"They explained that they would take a scope down my throat and start collecting pieces of tissue to send to Pathology while I was still under," Gary says. "And they would do this until they found the cancer."</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It was the best possible outcome. We had a touching, tearful moment there. I was lying in the hospital bed, both specialists were there — it was really wonderful. </p>
<cite>Gary McCracken</cite></blockquote>



<p>It didn't take long for them to find the source. Located in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/head-and-neck-cancer-center/home/orc-20457069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tonsil tissue</a> at the back of Gary's tongue was a cancerous, pea-sized tumor.</p>



<p>"It was so small that it didn't show up on any of the scans I had before coming to Mayo Clinic," Gary says. "Once they found it, they cut me from ear to Adam's apple and took out the remaining 39 lymph nodes on the left side of my neck."</p>



<p>When Gary came out of anesthesia, his team told him the news: They not only successfully found and removed the cancerous tumor, but he also would not need chemotherapy or radiation.</p>



<p>"It was the best possible outcome. We had a touching, tearful moment there. I was lying in the hospital bed, both specialists were there — it was really wonderful," Gary says.</p>



<p>"My wife and I are just so thrilled with the compassion and care of everyone involved, from the doctors to the nurses who would come in at night," he says. "Such a big part is to keep a positive outlook to fight whatever you're going through, and they just helped so much with that."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Recovering and looking forward to his future</strong></h2>



<p>Gary says life has been "surprisingly effortless" since recovering from surgery. He was home within a few days of the procedure and had complete function after a few weeks.</p>



<p>"I was eating fairly quickly and had very little pain," Gary says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that he's fully recovered, he plans to make the most of every day he has left. To him, that means traveling around the country with his wife to visit his children, who are relieved their dad is cancer-free.</p>



<p>"When I called and told them I was free and clear, there was this wonderful euphoria," Gary says. "My daughter said, 'This could have been the worst year of our lives, and it ended up being a pretty good summer.'"</p>



<p>Gary agrees.</p>



<p>The cherry on top of a good summer? A three-day backpacking trip to Goat Rocks Wilderness in the Cascade Mountain range of Western Washington with Thomas, his second-born son.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Gary-McCracken_3-16x9-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378722" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Gary-McCracken_3-16x9-1.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Gary-McCracken_3-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Gary-McCracken_3-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>"We did some camping when our kids were younger, and when Thomas moved to Portland, he got into backpacking," Gary says. "I started traveling out there yearly to go with him, but we had to skip a few times because of the pandemic."</p>



<p>With cancer behind him, Gary has a deeper appreciation for these adventures and the everyday moments in his life.</p>



<p>"It really is true what people say after they experience something like this — the sun shines brighter; the birds sing louder," Gary says. "Everything feels so good and rich and valuable."</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccinations.htm?web=1&amp;wdLOR=cE705E227-C66B-474D-A7D5-DF74FE61A43B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&nbsp;and Mayo Clinic recommend a yearly flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older, with rare exceptions.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/in-depth/flu-shots/art-20048000?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vaccination</a> is your best defense against flu.

But sometimes the flu and its complications can be deadly. People at higher risk of developing flu complications include young children, pregnant women and those two weeks postpartum, people over 65, people with weakened immune systems and some chronic illnesses, and people who are obese.</p>



<p>Having&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>, being treated for cancer or being a cancer survivor increase your risk for flu complications. For people at high risk, flu complications can include pneumonia, heart problems and acute respiratory distress syndrome. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pneumonia</a> is one of the most serious complications as it can be deadly for older adults and people with a chronic illness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>What is the flu?</strong></h2>



<p>What many people call the flu is actually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/viral-gastroenteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378847?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viral gastroenteritis</a>, or stomach flu, which is characterized by diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramps and pain.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Influenza</a>&nbsp;is the true flu. It's a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system, including your nose, throat and lungs.</p>



<p>At first, flu may seem like a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common cold</a>, with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. But while colds usually develop slowly, flu tends to come on suddenly. And although a cold can be a bother, you usually feel much worse with flu.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>How to keep yourself healthy</strong></h2>



<p>Unlike the common cold and stomach flu, there is a vaccine for flu. While it's not 100% effective, getting vaccinated for flu can reduce your risk of becoming infected with flu, and lessen its severity and lower your risk of hospitalization if you are infected.</p>



<p>In addition to vaccination, it's also important to take several measures to reduce the spread of infection, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wash your hands.</strong><br>Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is an effective way to prevent many common infections. Or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers if soap and water aren't available.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid touching your face.</strong><br>Specifically, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to prevent spreading viruses.</li>



<li><strong>Cover your coughs and sneezes.</strong><br>Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands.</li>



<li><strong>Clean surfaces.</strong><br>Regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid crowds.</strong><br>The flu spreads easily wherever people gather — in child care centers, schools, office buildings, auditoriums and public transportation. By avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you reduce your chances of infection.</li>

<p>When David Elder’s back started to hurt in the fall of 2022, he thought his recurrent spasms had returned. But when medication didn’t help like before, his doctor sent him to the ER – and soon after, he was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>, a treatable but incurable form of cancer that had caused several painful breaks in his spine.</p>



<p>“It just hit us out of nowhere,” he says of the diagnosis. “It was shocking.”</p>



<p>Five months earlier, in May, his routine bloodwork had come back normal, says Marcia, his wife of 38 years.</p>



<p>By October, David was fighting for his life.</p>



<p>Twenty years earlier, he had <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donated a kidney</a> to his cousin, and now cancer was attacking the remaining kidney, rendering him vulnerable.</p>



<p>David spent nine days at Baptist Hospital South in Jacksonville, Fla., where they rescued his kidney, but this triumph marked the beginning of his journey rather than the end.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>‘Mayo is right here’</strong></h2>



<p>The Elders live in St. Augustine, a northeast Florida community where David has been a worship pastor at Anastasia Baptist Church for 18 years. St. Augustine is about a half hour's drive from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida.</a></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Transplant-Innovation-Graphic-FINAL-1x1-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-377560" style="object-fit:cover;width:339px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Transplant-Innovation-Graphic-FINAL-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Transplant-Innovation-Graphic-FINAL-1x1-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Transplant-Innovation-Graphic-FINAL-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Transplant-Innovation-Graphic-FINAL-1x1-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Transplant-Innovation-Graphic-FINAL-1x1-1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Transplant-Innovation-Graphic-FINAL-1x1-1-2048x2048.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>


<p>“It took a little bit of a mind adjustment to realize, OK, this is cancer, and it's a serious type of cancer. But, you know, Mayo is right here, and people move from other states to be here,” David says. “It was a no-brainer to just come here and get the process started.”</p>



<p>The months to come would include more doctor visits, and in February David received a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant using his own bone marrow</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>Following surgery, he was told that he was a good candidate for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hospital-at-home/sections/overview/ovc-20551797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s Advanced Care at Home program</a>, which would allow him to heal at home, with Marcia by his side and a clinician just a video call away, day or night.</p>



<p>The Elders jumped at the chance.</p>



<p>Studies have shown that 90 percent of patients who receive care through Advanced Care at Home rate their satisfaction with the program as five out of five. In addition, compared to those who received hospital care, home healthcare patients had a 50 percent decrease in readmissions.</p>



<p>“The only time I left him was during the transplant when they wouldn’t let me in the room,” says Marcia, who provided David’s round-the-clock care at home. “What a blessing it was to be in our house.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No place like home</strong></h2>



<p>With Advanced Care at Home, an initiative of <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform</a>, patients like David can receive high-acuity care at home, thanks to modern technology and a home-services care team that visits in person at least twice daily and is available 24/7.</p>



<p>Advanced Care at Home teams collaborate to provide at-home care to patients in Jacksonville, Fla., Phoenix, Ariz., and northwest Wisconsin.</p>



<p>A patient’s physician decides if they could benefit from the program with the aid of two artificial intelligence-based algorithms that provide a “fit score” derived from historical home hospital admissions data.</p>



<p>Just a few hours after David’s transplant, he and Marcia learned that he was a candidate for the program. By 6:30 p.m. that same evening, they were back home. And ten minutes after they got there, the medical transport team arrived with all the supplies they needed.</p>



<p>David had been in the hospital for fewer than three days.</p>



<p>At home David could have familiar foods and drinks, watch his favorite channels, and read his own magazines and books. With more furniture at home than in the hospital, he could find a position that didn’t hurt his back as much during his waking hours. And at night, he got more and better-quality sleep without the constant beeping and frequent interruptions common in hospitals.</p>



<p>“It's not infrequent that patients tell me that they didn’t get a good night of sleep in the hospital, or that it’s triggered their stress and anxiety, or it’s made their pain worse, or that the bed was uncomfortable,” says Patricia Chipi, M.D., a hospital medicine physician at Mayo Clinic in Florida who works with Advanced Care at Home.</p>



<p>“With Advanced Care at Home, those concerns are much less. In fact, patients are typically saying, ‘I slept great last night, and I'm starting to feel so much better,’” Dr. Chipi says.</p>



<p>Being near loved ones, too, provides a healing balm for patients at home.</p>



<p>David and Marcia’s two sons and their families are based in Florida and were able to visit during his recovery. When they came over, David would position his chair with a clear line of sight to the toy corner, where their five grandkids would gather to play.</p>



<p>For Marcia, playing an active role in her husband’s daily care was a challenge that provided comfort, too.</p>



<p>“It’s so much better. … At home, there is something I can do, versus at the hospital, where I just have to sit and watch other people do,” she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Something old, something new</strong></h2>



<p>In the Mayo Clinic tradition, home healthcare harks back to the household visits that the Mayo brothers provided to patients in the past.</p>



<p>“It's a different way of getting better. It reflects on what we did 100 years ago, when people would heal at home,” says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/maniaci-michael-j-m-d/bio-20054934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Maniaci, M.D.</a>, chief clinical officer of Advanced Care at Home at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>While it is not a new concept, home-based care is gaining momentum today because innovative technologies are available to help clinicians provide safe, high-quality, hospital-level treatment for complex and acute cases outside the hospital.</p>



<p>“The secret sauce of Advanced Care at Home is the capability to take care of the sickest patients and provide safety and quality while not replicating the hospital experience,” Dr. Maniaci says. “There is something magical about being at home.”</p>



<p>Under the direction of Mayo Clinic physicians, Advanced Care at Home provides comprehensive services, including infusions, skilled nursing, medications, laboratory and imaging services, behavioral health, and rehabilitation services from a network of paramedics, nurses, and other support team members who ensure that the needs of the patient come first.</p>



<p>Advanced Care at Home also gives clinicians a unique view into patients’ lives, which provides valuable information for their care.</p>



<p>“When <a>you're</a> in their home, they feel much more comfortable. You get to see the dynamic between family members, which is helpful,” says physician assistant Jessica Denton, who was part of David’s care team. “I think you get a more honest patient this way.”</p>



<p>Since its launch in 2021, the program has provided care to over 700 Mayo Clinic patients as part of a strategic relationship with Medically Home, a Boston-based technology company that has helped provide care to more than 26,000 people across the U.S.</p>



<p>As the program’s patient numbers continue to grow, word is getting out — and patients are starting to ask whether healing at home is for them.</p>



<p>“Patients are really excited about it. Especially those that have been in and out of the hospital. Now that we've had the program in place for a few years, patients are asking about it more often. They're aware of the program, and they want to be a part of it. … I think that's a great thing for the patient,” says Dr. Chippi.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>



<p>Positive outcomes such as these point to a bright future for home-based healing.</p>



<p>“Virtual care and hybrid care are a large part of the future of medicine,” says Dr. Maniaci.</p>



<p>David Elder takes a positive view of the future, too. He will officially retire in December, and he and Marcia are currently enjoying spending time with their sixth grandchild, born in September.</p>



<p>His advice for anyone who receives a diagnosis like his?</p>



<p>“I would ask them to think about the life that is still yet to come. There could be years and years of it,” he says. “Do not be so taken by the cancer that it takes the life out of you before it takes the life from you.”</p>

<p>When Joanina Gicobi began her Ph.D. degree five years ago at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>, she was interested in thinking creatively about ways to improve <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer treatment</a>. In particular, she was curious about the body's natural ability to fight tumors: Could that process be improved? In the laboratory of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dong-haidong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Haidong Dong, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, she joined efforts to learn more about the T cells that are part of an inherent cancer-killing immune response.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Dr._Joanina_Gicobi-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378091" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Dr._Joanina_Gicobi-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Dr._Joanina_Gicobi.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joanina Gicobi, Ph.D.,</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"From the beginning, she was asking impressive questions about an issue that's been a great challenge," says Dr. Dong, whose lab focuses on cancer immunology and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>The inquisitive approach to problem-solving paid off. Dr. Gicobi, who recently completed her Ph.D. thesis, Dr. Dong and a team of Mayo Clinic researchers have provided a new understanding of the body’s cancer-fighting T cells, known as CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells. In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi2414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science Advances</a>, the research team describes a previously unknown type of CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells that can withstand the toxicity of treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The cells, which they call resilient T cells, remain functional, suggesting there may be additional opportunity after chemotherapy and radiotherapy to target the cancer via the immune system. What's more, the team identified a potential strategy to bolster the cancer-killing capabilities of these hardy cells.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scrutinizing cells that survive</strong></h2>



<p>One detail that has baffled researchers about CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells is their persistence, particularly in patients who seem to have run out of treatment options.</p>



<p>Some people with advanced cancer undergo what’s known as "salvage therapy" to ease late-stage symptoms. Salvage therapy may include chemotherapy and radiotherapy to shrink tumors that are not responding to immunotherapy or are too large to remove surgically, though the treatments are typically not expected to be a cure. However, researchers had noticed that even after several rounds of therapies that kill off immune cells along with the cancer, some patients sometimes still had cancer-killing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells circulating in their blood. And those cells, however beaten down, seemed capable of rallying an immune response.</p>

<p>"But we didn't know the nature of these particular CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells, how to identify them or what might make them unique," Dr. Dong says, adding that the lab hit numerous dead ends as they tried to characterize the cells. "It was not a straightforward route as we searched for answers."</p>



<p>The team monitored a cohort of patients who underwent salvage radiotherapy and then examined those patients' T cells. People who responded better to radiotherapy had T cells that used cellular energy most efficiently and could still kill cancer cells. Somehow the cells were less "exhausted" than other T cells. However, the phenotype didn't fully distinguish what was special about the cells.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Following the data</strong></h2>



<p>In her research, Dr. Gicobi set out to look for molecular markers particular to the T cells that rebound after cancer treatment. Using RNA sequencing, which can provide a map of all potential gene expression in a cell, she came across interesting findings that pointed back to certain genes. Dr. Gicobi noted several genes that were slightly different from those in typical CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells. Among them, she found a gene related to the cells' metabolic pathway, the process by which the cells produce and burn energy. This aligned with the earlier finding, and Dr. Gicobi felt encouraged to delve into the metabolism of the cells as a key differentiator.</p>



<p>"Dr. Dong has told me through my training, 'Always follow the data,'" Dr. Gicobi says.</p>

<p>As the team members looked further, they found the cells had heightened expression of the enzyme called malic enzyme 1, or ME1. "That was really interesting to us because ME1 is known to deal with molecules called reactive oxygen species, a metabolic byproduct that is important for the functions of immune cells but toxic when in excess. So we were looking at an enzyme that helps reduce the negative effects of metabolic pathways," she says. The finding helped confirm that the resilient T cells in people are a distinct subgroup of CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells.</p>



<p>Then, Dr. Gicobi had the idea that tinkering with ME1 to address the function and energy of immune cells might heighten their response to a tumor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She engineered the resilient T cells to overproduce ME1. The laboratory experiments found the increase of ME1 revived the cells and made them even better at killing off tumor cells.&nbsp; Importantly, Dr. Gicobi says, "We were able to increase their cancer-killing capacity without the accumulation of reactive oxygen species that induce cellular exhaustion."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During her graduate training, Dr. Gicobi presented the findings at the annual meeting of the American Association of Immunologists.</p>



<p>Says Dr. Dong, "The excitement and the questions from attendees were a sign that this work suggests new approaches and more options for improving T cell health, which is an important avenue for the field."</p>



<p>He says further research is necessary to determine how resilient T cells affect patient outcomes and why some people have resilient T cells and others don't. He also hopes to learn more about the mechanisms underlying the function of resilient T cells and to explore the potential development of ME1 as a therapy.</p>



<p>But an important first step has been the understanding that the presence of resilient T cells indicates the perseverance of the body's inherent immune response. "This is one milestone toward new discoveries that can hopefully be translated to help patients," he says.</p>

<p>World AIDS Day, observed on Dec. 1, raises awareness about <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/symptoms-causes/syc-20373524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HIV/AIDS</a> and pays tribute to those affected by the disease.

<p>HIV is the virus that causes the condition. The virus can spread through sexual contact, sharing infected needles and, less commonly, it can pass from mother to child. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rizza-stacey-a-m-d/bio-20054180?_ga=2.14289719.1803138945.1623070888-731220084.1621949447?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stacey Rizza</a>, a Mayo Clinic infectious diseases physician and HIV researcher, says that, while there has been much progress in fighting the infectious disease, HIV continues to be prevalent in "virtually every continent, every country, every religion and every socioeconomic class."

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How HIV affects the body</h3>



<p>The virus harms the body's immune system, affecting its ability to fight infections and diseases.</p>



<p>"The problem with HIV is it kills part of our immune cells, called the CD4 cell. And that makes people vulnerable to getting infections as well as cancers. It can hide away in the body in a latent state for many years. And that's why it's so difficult to cure HIV," she says. </p>



<p>"People may feel fine, but they're slowly living with the virus killing part of the immune system. And when the immune system gets low, people get significant and serious infections and cancers," Dr. Rizza adds.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HIV in society</h3>



<p>Though people with HIV now enjoy longer and healthier lives due to improved treatments, the challenges of curbing the ongoing HIV epidemic persist.</p>



<p>How to protect yourself from HIV:</p>



<ul>
<li>Practice safe sex.</li>



<li>Don't inject drugs, don't share needles or other drug injection devices.</li>



<li>Get tested.</li>
</ul>



<p>Anyone who suspects exposure through sexual contact, needle use or workplace incidents should reach out to their healthcare team or visit the emergency department. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Goal of treatment</h3>



<p>"Our goal is to diagnose people before they get to AIDS — to diagnose them when they have early-stage HIV, get them on treatment early on before the immune system is hurt, before the virus hurts any other part of the body and before they can infect other people," Dr. Rizza says. "If you start treatment during HIV at some point in the spectrum and you're stabilized, the virus is suppressed, and the immune system goes back to a normal level."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hope for HIV cure</h3>



<p>There's no universal cure for HIV/AIDS, but medications can help control it and stop it from getting worse. These antiviral treatments have cut down AIDS deaths worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research and hope for a cure continues, says Dr. Rizza. </p>



<p>"Every year, we see a few more people get functionally cured of HIV, which means they've gone through some kind of intervention that they no longer need to take the pills, but the virus stays completely suppressed. At Mayo Clinic, we are doing research on HIV cure. And several other places around the world are doing this research. And it's incredibly exciting," she says.</p>

<p>Lung cancer screening, for those eligible, should be done annually, and it involves a low-dose CT scan of the lungs. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/reisenauer-janani-s-m-d/bio-20433096?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Janani Reisenauer</a>, a thoracic surgeon and interventional pulmonologist, says Mayo Clinic is one of the pioneers in using new technology to fight the disease.</p>

<p>A lung nodule or lesion is an abnormality revealed on a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> that looks like a cancer. And to find out if it is cancer, doctors may recommend a technique called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bronchoscopy/about/pac-20384746?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bronchoscopy</a>.</p>



<p>"Very similar to having a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopy</a> performed where somebody is holding a scope. They're twisting the dials on that scope as they're maneuvering that scope through your airway or through your intestines for example," says Dr. Reisenauer.</p>



<p>That's a traditional manual bronchoscopy. Dr. Reisenauer says Mayo Clinic is one of only a handful of medical centers approved by the Food and Drug Administration to use robotic bronchoscopy.</p>



<p>"I would think about robotic bronchoscopy as a remote-controlled car. It doesn't go anywhere without you driving it and telling it where to go. But rather than me holding a scope that's maneuvered through a patient, the scope is docked to a robotic instrument," says Dr. Reisenauer.</p>



<p>Offering more precision, flexibility and control than a traditional bronchoscopy. She says it improves the ability to not only diagnose lung cancer, but now, in some cases, treat it.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic is participating in many cancer trials now, where we are treating lung nodules with a variety of ablative mechanisms. So we're either using extreme heat or cold, or even in some cases electricity. Or viruses injecting into tumors to try to reduce tumor burden or kill tumors," says Dr. Reisenauer.</p>

<p>During breaks from his doctoral research in London, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vile-richard-g-ph-d/bio-00027663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</a>, would visit a pediatric brain tumor clinic next to his lab for inspiration. Seeing children suffer changed the course of his career, igniting his passion for finding <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> treatments that would be easier for people to tolerate.</p>



<p>"I became very, very motivated to try and apply the science I learned to make cancer treatments gentler," says Dr. Vile. "My goal was to deliver an option that would extend and improve quality of life."</p>



<p>Decades later, Dr. Vile is leading research into genetically engineered viruses aimed at unleashing a two-pronged attack on cancer. One part of this technology, known as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/oncolytic-virus-optimizes-car-t-cell-therapy-for-solid-tumors/mac-20537878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oncolytic virus</a>, is designed to infect, break open and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. Dr. Vile's <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn2231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preclinical studies</a> have shown that oncolytic viruses replicated in cancer cells and cascaded to kill other diseased cells. That, in turn, triggered an immune response in which the patient’s own T cells, stimulated by the virus, recognized and targeted metastasized tumors for a second wave of cancer destruction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005.jpg" alt="Richard Vile, Ph.D." class="wp-image-377676" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005.jpg 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"Oncolytic viruses are a way to alert the immune system and mobilize it to kill cells infected with cancer," says Dr. Vile. "There's the direct killing of cancer cells with the virus, and then there's the major effect of immune activation. The immune system is incredibly well evolved to recognize infection, clear infection and kill all the cells around it that could be harboring infection."</p>



<p>In groundbreaking research, Dr. Vile's team is combining oncolytic viruses with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy</a>) to target solid tumors from liver cancer. This experimental approach of loading CAR-T cells with oncolytic virus is a new way to expand CAR-T cell therapy beyond treatment for blood cancers into treatment for solid tumors.</p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy is a regenerative immunotherapy in which a patient's T-cells are genetically modified to recognize and stop cancer. It has shown great promise by putting some B-cell lymphomas and leukemias into remission. CAR-T cells are highly targeted to tumor cells, with the goal of having fewer side effects than cancer treatments that also kill nearby healthy tissue.</p>



<p>"Loading the oncolytic virus onto CAR-T cells may give us three levels of killing. First, the CAR-T cells target the tumor and kill some of the cells," says Dr. Vile. "Next, it delivers the oncolytic virus, which infects tumor cells, replicates and kills them. Third, that alerts the immune system of the patient to the fact that there's something majorly wrong. The immune system starts to see the cancer and starts to react against it and kill it."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;supports Dr. Vile's research as part of its objective of delivering new cell therapies to people with complex disorders such as cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing the challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Oncolytic viruses are advancing from the lab to first-in-human clinical trials. Dr. Vile is working with the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics to biomanufacture oncolytic viruses onsite in Mayo Clinic's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) facilities. CGMP facilities are sterile rooms that help ensure that the therapy meets the identity, strength, quality and purity standards that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires for testing new therapeutics.</p>



<p>On-site biomanufacturing could lower production costs, allow for more individualized treatment and deliver the treatment to patients sooner than might be possible with an outside manufacturer.</p>



<p>"We are completing our studies in the lab and are transitioning to safety studies in the patient," explained Dr. Vile. "At the same time, we will manufacture the virus at a level of cleanliness (sterility) to meet FDA standards."</p>



<p>Oncolytic virus therapy is evolving, with more research needed to validate its safety and effectiveness. Dr. Vile hopes to test oncolytic viruses with CAR-T cell therapy for liver cancer in a phase 1 clinical trial in the next year or two.</p>

<p>"GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease, is when you get acid and chemical damage to the lining of the esophagus," says Dr. East.</p>



<p>You might feel a lump in the throat, have difficulty swallowing, have chest pain, a cough, or have worsening <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/is-there-a-connection-between-asthma-and-acid-reflux/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asthma-type</a> symptoms.</p>

"If this is persistent, you can develop scarring and a stricture."</p>



<p>But if it's persistent and heals, the lining of the esophagus can change to a more acid-resistant form, which is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/barretts-esophagus/symptoms-causes/syc-20352841?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barrett's esophagus</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It affects 10% to 15% of people with GERD. And a much smaller group faces another risk, says Dr. East.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> A 62-year-old man I worked with was diagnosed with stomach cancer earlier this year. He reportedly was feeling full even after eating small meals and experienced stomach pain above his belly button. I am starting to worry because I have recently started to experience similar symptoms. I’m only 38. Is it possible I could have stomach cancer? How do I get screened? What are the treatment options?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Most people diagnosed with<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopy/about/pac-20395197?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">stomach cancer</a>, which is also called gastric cancer,&nbsp;are over the age of 60. However,&nbsp;in the U.S., stomach cancers&nbsp;in people under 40 have been steadily rising. Overall, this form of cancer is not very common, but factors that increase your risk include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eating smoked, salted, processed or charcoaled meats, and pickled vegetables.</li>



<li>Eating few or no fruits and vegetables.</li>



<li>Alcohol use.</li>



<li>Previous stomach surgery.</li>



<li>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.</li>



<li>Inherited cancer syndromes such as: hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), familial adenomatous polyposis, gastric adenoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.</li>
</ul>



<p>Unfortunately, stomach cancer doesn’t always cause symptoms in its early stages, and many symptoms may not happen until the cancer is advanced. Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Difficulty swallowing.</li>



<li>Belly pain.</li>



<li>Feeling bloated after eating.</li>



<li>Feeling full after eating small amounts of food.</li>



<li>Not feeling hungry when you would expect to be hungry.</li>



<li>Losing weight without trying.</li>



<li>Feeling very tired.</li>



<li>Stools that look black.</li>

<p>If you have signs and symptoms that worry you, you should make an appointment with your healthcare team. Many other conditions can cause symptoms that are similar to stomach cancer. Your healthcare team may recommend testing such as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopy/about/pac-20395197?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">upper endoscopy</a>, also called an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which is a procedure that is used to visually examine your upper digestive system. This can be used to screen for stomach cancer as the cause of your symptoms. An EGD allows the doctor to look at the inside of your stomach. Stomach cancer can appear as an ulcer, a mass or a thickening of the stomach wall. Your physician then can obtain biopsies of the area to determine if you have stomach cancer.</p>



<p>The treatment of stomach cancer depends on the stage. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopic-ultrasound/about/pac-20385171?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Endoscopic ultrasound</a>, a minimally invasive procedure to assess diseases of the digestive (gastrointestinal) tract and other nearby organs and tissues, CT or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pet-scan/about/pac-20385078?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">PET scan imaging</a>, and a staging laparoscopy are used to determine the clinical stage.</p>



<p>While it is uncommon to find early stomach cancer, treatment for early-stage disease often only requires local treatment. For example, in early stomach cancers that involve only the mucosa, or inner lining of the stomach, and measure less than 2-3 centimeters in size, the stomach cancer can be removed using endoscopic submucosal dissection without the need for surgery or additional treatment. For other early stomach cancers that do not meet these criteria, surgery to remove the stomach cancer and regional lymph nodes is recommended.</p>



<p>However, if the cancer is found to have spread to the lymph nodes at the time of surgery, then the patient is at a higher risk of stomach cancer returning after surgery alone. Therefore, chemotherapy after surgery is often recommended to decrease the risk of cancer recurrence.</p>



<p>Typically, patients are diagnosed with more advanced stomach cancer, which means a deeper involvement of the stomach or spread to regional lymph nodes. In this more common situation, combining chemotherapy and surgery is necessary for the best outcomes. Chemotherapy usually is given before and after surgery in this case.</p>



<p>Finally, if the stomach cancer has been found to have spread outside the stomach and regional lymph nodes, then this is stage 4 cancer. The primary treatment is systemic therapy. Additional testing can be done on the tumor to determine if the stomach cancer might respond to targeted therapy or immunotherapy. In some cases where there is a small amount of tumor spread to the lining of the abdomen, also called the peritoneum, surgery called cytoreductive surgery and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/more-adventures-thanks-to-advanced-cancer-care-robotic-surgery/">hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;can be used to prolong a patient’s survival.</p>



<p>Treatment options to treat stomach cancer are complex and should be individualized to your particular situation. It is essential to seek out an experienced team to help with the accurate staging of cancer, help with management decisions and for high-quality endoscopic or surgical resection.<em> —&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grotz-travis-e-m-d/bio-20342285"><strong><em>Dr. Travis Grotz</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Surgical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>
