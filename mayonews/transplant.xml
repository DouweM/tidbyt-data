<p>In the U.S., <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17 people</a> die every day while waiting for an organ transplant.</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of people on <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=27#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of,percent%20of%20white%20living%20donors.">transplant waiting lists</a> come from minority communities, while about 30% of donors are people of color.</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/does-my-race-ethnicity-matter-in-organ-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood types</a> and certain HLA, or antibodies, tend to correlate with various ethnic groups," says Dr. Mao. "So it is not directly related to a particular minority group; however, organs will end up with someone of a similar background because the better matched an organ is, the more longevity that organ has."</p>



<p>Higher rates of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are present in minority communities, contributing to more organ failures.</p>



<p>"The more people we can help the sooner through transplant, the better," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>She says living donors do not experience a change in their quality of life after surgery, but a recipient's life can change for the better almost immediately.</p>



<p>"If somebody is approved to be a <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/process/living-donation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donor</a>, we expect they will live a full and normal life following their donation process," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>In most states, <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signing up</a> to be a donor after death can be done online or when registering for a driver's license or identification card. For a <a href="https://www.kidneyregistry.org/for-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donation</a>, contact the recipient's care team or a <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant center</a> for more information.</p>

<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/autologous-stem-cell-transplant/pyc-20384859">autologous bone marrow transplant</a>,&nbsp;a patient's own healthy stem cells are used to replace diseased or damaged bone marrow.</p>



<p>"It's an intense treatment that has to be done in the hospital — typically, patients who stay in the hospital for approximately three weeks," says Dr. Ayala.</p>



<p>He says this is the time the immune system regenerates.</p>



<p>"Within three to six months after the transplant, the immune system is expected to be back to normal," says Dr. Ayala.</p>



<p>Patients with autoimmune disorders can return to their lives — most remaining in remission — making this treatment a good option.</p>



<p>"Autologous transplantation is an alternative and effective alternative for patients with autoimmune disease that are failing the standard treatments," Dr. Ayala says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Silenced by cancer</h2>



<p>For the past decade, Marty battled a rare form of laryngeal cancer called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/what-is-laryngeal-chondrosarcoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chondrosarcoma</a>.</p>



<p>"I had dozens of surgeries and treatments that, over the years, took a toll on my larynx. After the last surgery, I woke up and my voice was gone," says Marty.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-role-of-the-larynx-and-how-to-protect-it/">larynx</a>, also known as the voice box, is located in the throat. Its main functions are helping people to speak, swallow and breathe.</p>



<p>"I had to get a tracheostomy tube implanted to help me breathe, and since then, my quality of life went downhill. People would look at me like I was strange," says Marty. "I got to the point I just didn't want to leave the house anymore."</p>



<p>Determined to find a way to get her husband's voice back, Marty's wife Gina scoured the internet for solutions. Her search led her to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-20055443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. David Lott</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Larynx and Trachea Transplant Program</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Lott and his team were conducting the first clinical trial in the U.S. on laryngeal transplantation. "I applied as a candidate for the program and got accepted. They told me it wouldn't be easy, but I was not going to give up," says Marty.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The groundbreaking larynx transplant</h2>



<p>A team of multidisciplinary doctors, including six surgeons, performed the 21-hour transplant on Feb. 29. The first step was to remove Marty's larynx.</p>



<p>"Our first priority was to remove the cancer," explains Dr. Lott. "When we were confident the cancer was gone, we then focused on transplanting the donor larynx."</p>

<p>Laryngeal transplantation is a rare procedure that has been performed only a handful of times in the world. Marty's case was the third total larynx transplant in the U.S., and the first known case performed as part of a clinical trial. Dr. Lott hopes the clinical trial will allow his team to scientifically investigate the procedure to prove it is a safe and effective option for patients.</p>



<p>The Mayo transplant is also the first known case in the world of a larynx transplant performed on a patient with an active cancer. Doctors were able to proceed with the transplant because Marty was already on immunosuppressive therapy from a previous kidney transplant.</p>



<p>"Having a patient with an active cancer who already had his own immune suppression allowed us to do the transplant safely without introducing additional risk in a way that has rarely, if ever, been done before," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Girish Mour,&nbsp;M.B.B.S., </a>medical director of the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently there are tens of thousands of people worldwide who are living without a voice box, mostly due to trauma or cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated there will be 12,650 new cases of laryngeal cancer in 2024. Dr. Lott says many of those patients will be among the highest at risk of losing their larynx.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Breaking the silence</h2>



<p>In just over four months after his surgery, Marty had regained full ability to swallow foods, was making progress learning to breathe on his own again and speaking with his voice at 60%.</p>



<p>"I was able to talk to my 82-year-old mother on the phone," says Marty. She could hear me and understood every word I said. It is amazing."</p>



<p>"It is remarkable," says Dr. Lott. "Marty has exceeded all of our expectations. I didn't expect him to be eating a hamburger this soon after a larynx transplant, if ever. It is truly amazing."</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/FTsi0phjWDo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Welcome home Marty</strong></a></h3>

<p>Marty and Gina celebrated the successful transplant with an extended road trip on their way home. "We wanted to take a moment and appreciate where this journey has led us and where we are today," says Marty.</p>



<p>The couple had already made a visit to the Grand Canyon. After leaving Phoenix, they stopped in San Diego to see the Pacific Ocean, visited the Golden Gate Bridge, and got a glimpse of Mount Rushmore and Niagara Falls.</p>

<p>"It feels so amazing to be able to talk to anyone I meet on the street," says Marty. I will be forever grateful to Dr. Lott and Mayo for giving me my life back. I am also deeply grateful for the generosity of my organ donor and the donor family. They are the true heroes of this story."</p>



<p>When the couple arrived home in Haverhill, they were greeted by a cheering crowd of family, friends and reporters all eager to hear his voice.</p>

<p>"I will share my story with anyone who wants to hear it," says Marty. "My job right now is to heal up and get my voice back 100%. My next job will be to reach out to as many people as I can and let them know they can do it too."</p>

<p>How is artificial intelligence used to improve all parts of the organ transplant process? On the latest episode of <a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=tcepisodesix&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=global&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=185877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomorrow's Cure</a>, learn about the efforts to use AI to help physicians detect organ failure earlier. AI is also powerful in helping detect the potential impacts of early interventions to delay or prevent organ failure and the need for organ replacement therapies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week's podcast episode features <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/goswami-rohan-m-m-d/bio-20432467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Rohan Goswami</a>, Transplant Cardiologist and Director of Heart Transplant Research and Innovation at Mayo Clinic, and <a href="https://gpx.ai/company" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Javier Echenique</a>, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer at GPx, a healthcare technology company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GPx developed a bloodless blood test, a wearable device that utilizes AI to monitor patients with heart failure. The innovation allows physicians to monitor patients proactively to prevent their conditions from worsening.</p>



<p>"Sometimes, you rely on patients to tell you they don’t feel great before you decide to intervene. Often, by that point, things have gone really far," explains Echenique. "There's very little that Dr. Goswami can do to really turn around that condition. But, if you can catch it earlier, he can help that patient better. The blood test tends to show this change in the patient often before the patient starts feeling symptoms themselves."&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Advancements in technology could help patients prevent a decline in their heart health, as well as reduce hospitalizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the biggest role for AI, where I see it really helping transplant patients is to actually avoid transplant altogether,” said Dr. Goswami.&nbsp;“One of the things that we're working on is predicting who has heart failure and who's going to recover with certain therapies that we apply. And, earlier prediction and understanding of, their environmental factors, their disease state, what medications they're on, what their antiprobiology trend looks like, really may give us a better idea.”</p>

But what is the larynx and what does it do?</p>



<p>When you talk, many parts of your body work together to make a sound. The larynx, also called the voice box, plays an important part in the process.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-20055443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. David Lott</a>, a Mayo Clinic otolaryngologist who&nbsp;led the first known clinical trial on laryngeal transplantation in the U.S., says&nbsp;that, along with speech production, the larynx has a number of other vital roles.</p>

Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/SCRIPT-MCM-Role-of-the-larynx-and-how-to-protect-it.pdf">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>It is the primary organ that's responsible for your ability to speak, for your ability to swallow, to eat and drink, and to breathe," says Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>The larynx also helps sense when food is swallowed. Dr. Lott says it governs those functions in two ways.</p>



<p>"When we swallow, the vocal folds close. That movement is very important in terms of regulating how good the voice sounds, how good someone swallows and how good they can breathe," he explains.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="537" height="385" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/voice-box-vocal-cords.png" alt="Larynx, voice box, vocal chards" class="wp-image-261241" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/voice-box-vocal-cords.png 537w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/02/voice-box-vocal-cords-300x215.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></figure></div>


<p>Secondly, he says it's through the movement of the larynx itself.</p>



<p>"The entire larynx has to move forward and backward when you swallow to allow food to get into the esophagus so that it can get into your stomach," Dr. Lott says.</p>



<p>The best way to protect your larynx is to be in tune with your voice and know if something is off.</p>



<p>"Or if it's harder for you to speak, you can't yell or you can't sing, whatever it may be — be clued in that. Maybe there's something either functionally or structurally that may be going on," he says.</p>



<p>If you have lingering symptoms, consider seeking medical attention.</p>

<p><em>Surgeons at Mayo Clinic in Arizona perform a total larynx transplant</em></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic envisions a day when regenerative science makes it possible to offer a total larynx transplant to anyone who needs one. The research team of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-00092606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, hopes to overcome a shortage of donor organs and minimize the need for lifelong drugs to prevent organ rejection. Through regenerative sciences, the team is investigating ways a person's own tissue could be used as a natural therapeutic to integrate a donor larynx into the body with less risk of rejection.</p>



<p>"Immune suppressant drugs keep the body's defense system from mistakenly attacking donor tissues and organs. However, they come with risks. In some cases, these powerful drugs could cause infections or cancer," says Dr. Lott, director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Larynx and Trachea Transplant Program</a>. "Our goal in establishing a larynx transplant program is to improve treatment options and quality of life for patients."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shedding cells, growing tissue</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/head-and-neck-regenerative-medicine/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Regenerative Medicine Lab</a> are investigating a technique, called decellularization, in which all cells are washed from donor tissues and organs. The laryngeal organ structure that remains has shown the potential to attract new cells and spur the tissue growth needed to meld the new organ into the body's function.</p>



<p>"Removing cells from donor organs could potentially reduce immune responses that lead to rejection. We could potentially accept more organs that are not an exact match, thereby overcoming the shortage of viable organs available for people with laryngeal diseases," says Dr. Lott. "We also hope decellularization would reduce or eliminate reliance on the immunosuppressant drugs."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bioprinting to heal a damaged larynx</strong></h2>



<p>Another approach is looking at how 3D bioprinting could help patients with laryngeal disease.</p>



<p>Right now, surgeons can use a 3D bioprinter and living cells to print three-dimensional structures that are an exact replica of the patient's damaged tissue. The surgical team then replaces the diseased portion of the larynx with the 3D implant to restore function. This pioneering procedure preserves the healthy portion of the larynx, sparing a patient the pain and hardship of removing the entire larynx—a procedure known as a laryngectomy.</p>



<p>In the future, the team aspires to use the 3D bioprinter to bioengineer a total larynx for patients. First, the team must understand how to grow blood vessels and deliver oxygen and nutrients into the bioprinted organ.</p>



<p>"Our research will focus on whether a bioprinted scaffold could function like a natural organ. The concept of using patients' own cells to print a larynx customized to their individual physiological needs is very exciting," says Dr. Lott. "We are still quite a way off from making this a reality. It will require more years of research to understand if this is a viable approach to treating laryngeal diseases."</p>

<p><em>Researchers use a 3D bioprinter for partial larynx implants</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Many patients are waiting for treatment</strong></h2>



<p>The larynx, also known as the voice box, is a delicate and complex organ that is vital to breathing, speaking and swallowing.</p>



<p>The American Cancer Society estimates that 12,650 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with laryngeal cancer this year. Many others will lose laryngeal function through traumatic injury. </p>



<p>After a laryngectomy, a person must breathe through a hole in the neck and eat through a feeding tube. Even simple tasks like taking a shower can become burdensome. The ability to prevent a laryngectomy can restore quality of life to thousands of people.</p>



<p>"We hope through research and advancements in regenerative biotherapeutics, we can establish the scientific foundation for a larynx transplant program that brings this procedure to patients more broadly," says Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>On February 29, Dr. Lott led a team of six surgeons in transplanting a donor larynx into a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/breaking-the-silence-first-known-total-larynx-transplant-on-a-patient-with-active-cancer-as-part-of-landmark-clinical-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">59-year-old patient</a> with a voice box damaged by cancer. It was Mayo Clinic's first larynx transplant and the first known larynx transplant in the U.S. for a patient with active cancer done in a clinical trial. Researchers hope to build a body of knowledge and scientific evidence to expand the procedure to patients without a larynx and to those with active cancers.</p>



<p>Dr. Lott is also the associate director of Mayo Clinic's Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics in Arizona and the chair of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/doctors/drc-20424100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Otolaryngology</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. The <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> supports Dr. Lott's regenerative sciences research as part of its objective of delivering new biotherapeutics to improve patient care.</p>

<p>Growing up as the child of a voice instructor, Emily Hardy developed a lifelong interest in singing. But the third-year student at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine</a> never dreamed her interest in vocals would lead to research related to the first larynx transplant at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"When I first learned that Mayo Clinic was advancing the larynx transplant, I thought the procedure is something that will be exciting for Mayo to be able to do for patients — something I couldn't even fathom," she says. "I knew I wanted to be fully involved in advancing the research in this area."</p>



<p>In addition to her medical degree, Hardy is pursuing a master's degree at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>. Her research project is looking at ways to make the post-laryngeal transplant regimen easier for patients. Because receiving a transplant requires lifelong immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of the new organ, Hardy is investigating removing the cells of a laryngeal transplant model, looking for approaches that reduce the immune response and, hopefully, the need for medication.</p>



<p>"If we can reduce the immune response or the need for immunosuppression that could make laryngeal transplant available to more patients and improve their quality of life," she says.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Voice as a hobby and a scientific study</strong></h2>



<p>Finding joy in singing with others, Hardy participated in a choir in college, and, when she came to medical school at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, she performed with a community-based barbershop group.</p>



<p>"I've always loved anything related to the voice," she says. "When I came to medical school, I'd never thought of incorporating that into my career until I began learning about laryngology and ear nose and throat surgery and realized how those specialties matched that specific interest."</p>



<p>As a medical student also interested in conducting biomedical research, her interest in the intersection of that work and singing would put her at the cutting edge of a brand-new field of study: regenerative sciences. During her first year of medical school, as she sought opportunities to work in a lab, she found <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-00092606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology (ENT) - <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/head-and-neck-cancer-center/sections/overview/ovc-20457072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Surgery</a>/Audiology at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>. His research applies the approaches of regenerative medicine to restoring the voices of patients who have had a laryngectomy — a surgery to remove the voice box.</p>



<p>Regenerative medicine is an approach that shifts the focus from treating disease to rebuilding health by repairing, replacing or restoring damaged tissues, cells or organs.&nbsp;As director of the Head and Neck Regenerative Medicine Lab at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Lott has focused on establishing techniques to regenerate the voice box and restore its abilities after diseases or traumas.</p>



<p>His work led to the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-marks-medical-milestone-with-worlds-first-known-successful-total-larynx-transplant-performed-in-a-patient-with-an-active-cancer-as-part-of-a-clinical-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first laryngeal transplant at Mayo Clinic</a> — actually replacing a damaged voice box with all its necessary functions. People whose voice box was damaged from injury, cancer or the residual effects of radiation treatment — as many as 60,000 people in the U.S. — can neither speak with their natural voices nor breathe through their noses. Mayo Clinic is in the process of establishing the first ongoing larynx transplant program in the country. Dr. Lott and colleagues are advancing the transplant procedure and also exploring other regenerative approaches to larynx restoration, including the use of stem cells and growth factors to help grow functional tissue.</p>



<p>As Hardy learned about the lab's various approaches to laryngeal transplant and the potential to restore function through regenerative sciences, she knew she wanted to contribute to research to further options for voice-impaired patients.</p>



<p>The field of regenerative medicine is so new that few people are versed in its principles and techniques. Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of training the workforce in this emerging field, offering doctoral and post-graduate training in Regenerative Sciences through the Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. Hardy is an example of the future physician-scientists that Mayo is training to deliver the newest regenerative technologies and carry on the work for the next generation.</p>



<p>"Education plays a key role, complementing the research and practice components, in the laryngeal transplant," says Dr. Lott. The entire staff involved in a transplant rehearsed and trained for it, including nurses who underwent specialized in-service training and online courses. Training for the laryngeal transplant provided a unique learning opportunity for residents at<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education</a>, including head and neck surgical resident Payam Entezami, M.D., who assisted the surgical team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address patient needs following the transplant, Hardy found she could amplify her medical school training by pausing it to pursue a master's degree in regenerative sciences, attending classes about its innovative approaches and conducting research in Dr. Lott's lab. She is among Mayo's first students in the program, and says she is impressed by the topics involved — stem cells, tissue engineering, 3D bioprinting — and the vast areas of medicine it touches.</p>



<p>"There are so many different approaches within regenerative medicine and ways to apply it to specific clinical areas of interest," she says.</p>



<p>"We’re educating a specialized clinical workforce of the future, who will have the understanding to manifest the potential held within regenerative medicine," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wyles-saranya-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-20476857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saranya Wyles, M.D., Ph.D.</a> a dermatologist and associate director of education at Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "Regenerative technologies, focused on restoring form and function, have the potential to transform standard of care. The approach begets a new set of skills."</p>



<p>Dr. Lott is enthusiastic that Hardy's research will contribute to the growing information about laryngeal transplant. He's also emphatic about the importance of the various educational opportunities emerging in regenerative medicine.</p>



<p>"We're training the next generation of scientists and clinicians who are going to be pushing the field ahead," he says. "It's one thing to be able to develop regenerative approaches for patients now. It's a whole other to establish the experts in this new field who can help patients for years and years down the road."</p>

<p><em>Surgeons at Mayo Clinic in Arizona perform a total larynx transplant</em></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's unique culture of teamwork and collaboration, hallmarks since the days of Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie Mayo, laid the foundation for Mayo's first larynx transplant that happened February 29 in Arizona. This groundbreaking surgery, only third larynx transplant in the U.S., continues the innovative work for which the Mayo brothers were known.</p>



<p>A team of six surgeons and 20 support staff combined expertise from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/doctors/drc-20424100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Otolaryngology</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;mastery of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Transplantation</a> in an extraordinary 21-hour operation. They transplanted a donor larynx in a 59-year-old patient with cancer whose damaged larynx hampered his ability to talk, swallow and breathe.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">larynx transplant</a> was a composite neck transplant that included at least eight different types of tissue, including the larynx, upper trachea, upper esophagus, pharynx, thyroid glands, parathyroid glands, nerves and blood vessels — commonly called the throat.&nbsp; It's a rare type of transplant known as a vascular composite allograft.&nbsp; The larynx — also called the voice box — is a delicate organ composed of tissue, cartilage and joints that must be able to move after transplantation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A team science approach to larynx transplantation</strong></h2>



<p>This complex surgery is an example of Mayo Clinic's team science approach, to advance research innovation to patient care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic's team science approach made it possible for us to offer this type of a transplant on a scale that was previously unattainable," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-00092606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, chair of the Arizona Department of Otolaryngologist and lead surgeon. "All transplants are complex, but there are more tissue types and moving parts with laryngeal transplantation than other transplants.</p>



<p>In any transplant, the body's immune system flags the donor organ as a foreign object and tries to reject it. A key to success is identifying the right immunosuppressant drugs that allow the body to recognize and accept the new tissue. That was exceptionally challenging in this complex surgery that required eight types of donor tissue. This first transplant will serve as a baseline for understanding the various immune responses, quality of life and long-term sustainability of the larynx transplant.</p>



<p>"Our research laid the foundation for understanding the unique immunosuppressant needs of the patient after transplanting multiple types of tissues," says Dr. Lott. "Preclinical models helped us learn which medications could regulate the immune responses of the various different donor tissue with fewest potential side effects and still be powerful enough to prevent rejection."</p>



<p>This is also the first known larynx transplant in a patient with active cancer who was part of a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03269396?intr=larynx%20transplant&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial.</a> &nbsp;Dr. Lott and the team will now conduct research aimed at establishing scientific evidence to support the first-ever clinical service line in laryngeal transplantation.</p>



<p>"Because this surgery is so rare, there are a lot of unknowns.&nbsp; We will continue our study of laryngeal transplantation in the patient's follow-up care to determine how well the new organ has restored his ability to talk, breathe and eat," says Dr. Lott. "Besides the quality-of-life issues, we want to study how well the transplanted tissues are functioning over time."</p>



<p>The initial focus of the larynx transplant study will be patients who have a voice box that is no longer functional due to previous cancer or traumatic injury. The team is not yet transplanting a donor larynx in a person who has had a total larynx removal — known as a laryngectomy. They hope to use the research to improve this surgery to make it possible for more patients, including those without a larynx, in the near future.</p>

<p>On Feb. 29, Marty Kedian made history by successfully undergoing a groundbreaking surgery at Mayo Clinic that is providing hope to thousands who have lost their voice and ability to swallow and breathe on their own due to diminished laryngeal function or total loss of their larynx.</p>



<p>This is the third known larynx transplant in the U.S. and the first known case performed on a patient with an active cancer as part of a clinical trial. It is also Mayo Clinic's first total larynx transplant. The multidisciplinary team, including six surgeons, was led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-20055443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. David Lott</a>, chair of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20424084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Otolaryngology (ENT) - Head and Neck Surgery/Audiology at Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>.

<p>Experts say the larynx transplant at Mayo is a pivotal milestone in making the rare procedure available as a scientifically proven, safe and effective procedure for a wider population.</p>



<p>For Marty, it marks the beginning of his quest to break the silence on laryngeal transplantation.</p>

<p>A multidisciplinary team, including six surgeons, conducted the 21-hour transplant. Four months after surgery, Marty has regained use of his voice and his ability to swallow and breathe on his own, exceeding the transplant team's expectations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Silenced by cancer</strong></h2>



<p>"I love to talk to people everywhere I go," says Marty. "I'm that guy at the baseball game who doesn't know anyone sitting around them. And by the end of the game, I'm friends with everyone in my section."</p>



<p>Marty's world changed in 2013 when he went to the doctor after noticing he was having trouble swallowing his food. "Food was getting caught in my throat. I thought I had allergies. I didn't really think anything of it," recalls Marty.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="909" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-1024x909.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390166" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-1024x909.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-300x266.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-768x682.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-1536x1364.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-and-gina-in-their-apt-2048x1818.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Marty and Gina Kedian</strong> <strong>and their dog Baxter</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>A series of tests revealed Marty had a rare form of laryngeal cancer called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chondrosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chondrosarcoma</a>. Doctors told Marty he needed surgery. "It was a shock," recalls Marty. "It was devastating. I wasn't going to die, but I had a job that required me to talk to people all day long." For 35 years, Marty worked at a local print shop speaking with customers in Haverhill, Massachusetts, where he lives with his wife, Gina, and their family.</p>



<p>Marty underwent his first surgery in 2014. Over the next 10 years, dozens more followed, reducing Marty's voice to a raspy whisper. No longer able to breathe on his own, Marty underwent surgery to have a tracheostomy tube inserted so he could breathe through a hole in the front of his neck.</p>



<p>"Everywhere I went, the first thing people would ask me is, 'How many cigarettes did you smoke a day?' I never smoked a cigarette in my life," says Marty. "People would immediately shut down and back away from me. After a while, I just didn't want to go out anywhere. I was alive, but I wasn't living." Marty was eventually told his last option was a total laryngectomy, or removal of his voice box. He declined. "I didn't want a laryngectomy. I wanted to find a way to get my quality of life back," says Marty.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390142" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Marty-feeding-baby-Charlotte.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Marty with his granddaughter, Charlotte   Photo courtesy: Kedian Family</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I just had my first grandchild. I wanted to be able to talk to her with my own voice, play with her in the yard and take her to baseball games and breathe normally. Gina knew I was already depressed and out of my mind. She kept saying there had to be another way. She went online, and that's when she found Dr. Lott."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding hope at Mayo Clinic</h2>



<p>Thousands of miles from Marty's home, at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Dr. Lott was leading a team of scientists researching laryngeal restoration and transplantation. Dr. Lott is an ear, nose and throat surgeon who specializes in laryngeal surgery. For the past two decades, Dr. Lott and his team have been <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/head-and-neck-regenerative-medicine/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigating ways to restore and save a person's voice and laryngeal function.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="698" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-698x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390168" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-204x300.jpg 204w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116-1047x1536.jpg 1047w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0116.jpg 1284w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Dr. David Lott discusses laryngeal transplantation with Kedian at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I set my path on becoming a laryngeal surgeon and researcher to build a program that is pushing the boundaries of science forward," explains Dr. Lott.</p>



<p>"Nobody really thinks of their larynx until it's gone," says Dr. Lott. "Then your ability to speak, breathe and swallow is gone, and you are left breathing through a hole in your neck. It is very isolating, and many become a shell of who they used to be. I wanted to find a way to help restore a person's quality of life."</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/preparing-for-mayos-first-larynx-transplant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In 2016, Dr. Lott's program was granted approval to conduct the first clinical trial in the U.S. on laryngeal transplantation</a>. "Until now, laryngeal transplants have been done as one-offs," says Dr. Lott. "This clinical trial allows us to conduct a true scientific investigation aimed at thoroughly researching the safety and efficacy of laryngeal transplantation as a trusted option for patients."</p>



<p>One of the biggest challenges to advancing laryngeal transplantation as an option for cancer patients like Marty has been the risk associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapy. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/11-16-four-ways-organ-transplants-are-being-transformed-to-save-more-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transplant</a> patients are given immunosuppressive drugs to lower the body's immune response, which reduces the risk of organ rejection. However, immunosuppression also increases the risk of the cancer spreading. Marty was already on immunosuppressives due to a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-surgeons-perform-first-robotic-assisted-kidney-transplant-in-minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> years ago.</p>



<p>"Having a patient with an active cancer who already has his own immune suppression allowed us to do the transplant safely without introducing additional risk in a way that has rarely, if ever, been done before," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Girish Mour, M.B.B.S.,</a> medical director of the program.</p>

<p>Removing the cancer was the surgical team's main priority. "First, we removed Mr. Kedian's cancerous larynx," explains Dr. Lott. "Then, with the confidence of our team that the cancer was gone, we focused on the transplant. The entire procedure went better than we expected."</p>



<p>In addition to the larynx, surgeons transplanted the pharynx, upper trachea, upper esophagus, thyroid and parathyroid glands, blood vessels, and nerves.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Marty's road to recovery</strong></h1>



<p>Four months after his transplant, Marty regained 60% of his voice. Doctors say it will continue to improve as he heals over the next year. He has also regained the ability to swallow and breathe on his own. "It is truly amazing," says Marty. "Dr. Lott and the team at Mayo have not only given me my voice back, they've also given me my life back."</p>



<p>Speech and swallow therapy at Mayo has been a significant part of Marty's recovery.</p>



<p>"Marty's progress is remarkable," describes Dr. Lott. "He is eating hamburgers, macaroni and cheese, almost anything with no problem. His breathing also continues to steadily improve." Doctors plan to remove the tracheostomy tube when Marty regains full function of his ability to breathe on his own.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>"The holy grail for managing laryngeal cancer"</strong></h1>



<p>"The case signifies a monumental breakthrough," says Dr. Marshall Strome, who performed the world's first successful larynx transplant in 1998. "It represents the future of laryngeal transplantation where every patient needing a total laryngectomy will have the option of a reconstruction that allows them to maintain their quality of life."</p>



<p>Dr. Lott did some of his early training under Dr. Strome. Since then, Dr. Strome has remained a trusted mentor to Dr. Lott. In a full circle moment, Dr. Strome was present when Dr. Lott performed the transplant at Mayo in February.</p>



<p>"With the clinical trial underway, Dr. Lott and his team are positioned to advance the field in ways no other program can currently achieve. The Mayo team has discovered the holy grail for managing laryngeal cancer, which I believe will come to fruition by the end of this decade," says Dr. Strome.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Breaking the silence on laryngeal transplantation</strong></h1>



<p>Less than five months after surgery, Marty and Gina are excited to return home to Massachusetts. "We couldn't have done this without everyone's love and support," says Gina.</p>



<p>"I will always be grateful to the team at Mayo and especially for the generosity of my organ donor and the donor family," says Marty.</p>



<p>Dr. Lott's clinical trial is approved to perform additional larynx transplants in the coming years.</p>



<p>Marty is looking forward to doing what he loves most — talking to family, friends and everyone else he meets. He is especially looking forward to talking with his granddaughter, Charlotte.</p>



<p>"I will be reading her lots of bedtime stories," says Marty. Meanwhile, Marty also is planning to share his own story to inspire others.</p>



<p>"My first job is to get better," says Marty. "My next job will be to tell everyone they can do it too."</p>

<p>PHOENIX — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> announces a groundbreaking achievement in organ transplantation, offering hope to thousands who have lost their ability to speak, swallow and breathe on their own due to diminished function or loss of their larynx. A multidisciplinary team of doctors in Arizona performed the third known total larynx transplant in the U.S. The case also marks a medical milestone as the first known total larynx transplant performed as part of a clinical trial and the first on a patient with active cancer in the U.S.</p>



<p>"The surgery and patient's progress have exceeded our expectations," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-20055443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology (ENT) - <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/head-and-neck-cancer-center/sections/overview/ovc-20457072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Surgery</a>/Audiology at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>. "This is a tremendous accomplishment in launching what we believe is the future for laryngeal transplantation."</p>



<p>A paper by Dr. Lott on the case was published July 9 in the peer-reviewed medical journal <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/jmcp/Lott-1720450777830.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>. The larynx, located in the throat, is commonly known as the voice box. Larynx transplantation is a rare and complex procedure, performed only a handful of times in the world. Even more notably, Mayo Clinic's surgical team successfully performed the larynx transplant on a patient with an active cancer, making it one of the first cases of its kind globally.</p>



<p>Six surgeons at Mayo Clinic conducted the 21-hour transplant, which included the larynx, pharynx, upper trachea, upper esophagus, thyroid and parathyroid glands, blood vessels, and nerves.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a> was performed on a Massachusetts man, Marty Kedian, who was diagnosed with a rare form of laryngeal cancer called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chondrosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chondrosarcoma</a>. For 10 years, Kedian underwent dozens of surgeries, which eventually robbed him of his voice and his ability to swallow and breathe normally. Several years ago, Kedian had to undergo a tracheostomy that allowed him to breathe through a hole in his neck. He says the tracheostomy, combined with the loss of his voice, significantly diminished his quality of life. "I was alive, but I wasn't living," says Kedian. "I love to talk to people everywhere I go, and I just couldn't. I felt strange, and I wouldn't go out anywhere."</p>



<p>After years of surgeries, doctors told Kedian his only remaining option was to get a laryngectomy and have his larynx completely removed. He declined. "I didn't want a laryngectomy. I wanted to find a way to get my quality of life back," he says.</p>



<p>Kedian found what he was looking for at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/larynx-trachea-transplant/overview/ovc-20508897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Larynx and Trachea Transplant Program</a>, where Dr. Lott was leading the first known clinical trial on laryngeal transplantation in the U.S. After being accepted as a patient for the clinical trial, Kedian and his wife, Gina, moved to a temporary home in Phoenix. On Feb. 29, Kedian became Mayo Clinic's first patient to undergo a total larynx transplant. "I wanted this so I could talk and breathe normally with my new granddaughter. I want to read her bedtime stories with my own voice," says Kedian.</p>



<p>Because it was conducted as part of a clinical trial, Mayo's case is considered a significant pivotal step in making the rare procedure available to a wider population. "Until now, laryngeal transplants have been done as one-offs," says Dr. Lott. "This clinical trial allows us to conduct a true scientific investigation aimed at thoroughly researching the safety and efficacy of laryngeal transplantation as a trusted option for patients." The program is approved to perform additional larynx transplants in the coming years.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cancer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a> estimates there will be 12,650 new cases of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laryngeal cancer</a> in the U.S. this year. Until now, many of these patients had little hope of laryngeal transplantation as a possible option in the future due to the risk associated with the use of immunosuppressive therapy. Transplant patients are given immunosuppressive therapy to lower the body's immune response, which reduces the risk of organ rejection. However, immunosuppressive drugs also increase the risk of the cancer spreading.</p>



<p>Kedian's case was unique. He was already on immunosuppressive therapy from a previous kidney transplant. "Having a patient with an active cancer who already had his own immune suppression allowed us to do the transplant safely without introducing additional risk in a way that has rarely, if ever, been done before," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Girish Mour,</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mour-girish-k-m-b-b-s/bio-20392405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M.B.B.S.</a>, medical director of the program. Dr. Lott adds, "Being able to perform this transplant in the setting of active cancer in a patient already on immunosuppressive therapy, under the rigor and oversight of a clinical trial, enabled us to take that vital step toward better understanding the safety for cancer patients and potentially making larynx transplant a standard option."</p>



<p>Removing the cancer was the surgical team's main priority. "First, we removed Mr. Kedian's cancerous larynx," explains Dr. Lott. "Then, with the confidence of our team that the cancer was gone, we focused on the transplant."</p>



<p>Four months after surgery, Kedian can speak with his new voice, swallow and breathe on his own, which Dr. Lott calls remarkable. "Mr. Kedian has already regained about 60% of his voice, which I wouldn't have thought would happen for at least a year. He still speaks with the same voice and Boston accent he had prior to the cancer," says Dr. Lott. "He can also eat hamburgers, macaroni and cheese, almost anything, and swallow with no problem. His breathing also continues to steadily improve." Doctors plan to remove the tracheostomy tube when Kedian regains full ability to breathe on his own.</p>



<p>"The team at Mayo has given me my life back," says Kedian. "I'm so grateful. I have the deepest gratitude for Dr. Lott's team and especially the generosity of my organ donor and donor family. I hope one day I get the chance to tell them, 'Thank you.'"</p>



<p>"This case signifies a monumental breakthrough. It represents the future of laryngeal transplantation, where every patient needing a total laryngectomy will have the option of a reconstruction that allows them to maintain their quality of life," says Marshall Strome, M.D., who made medical history by performing the world's first total laryngeal transplant in 1998. "With the clinical trial underway, Dr. Lott and his team are positioned to advance the field in ways no other program can currently achieve. The Mayo team has discovered the holy grail for managing laryngeal cancer, which I believe will come to fruition by the end of this decade."</p>



<p>Dr. Lott calls Kedian's case the capstone of his two decades of research. In addition to the clinical trial, Dr. Lott's research team is investigating ways to restore laryngeal function through improving transplantation techniques and pioneering <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/head-and-neck-regenerative-medicine/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative medicine technologies</a>. "I set my path on becoming a laryngeal surgeon and researcher to build a program that is pushing the boundaries of science forward," says Dr. Lott. "Our dedication is to the thousands of individuals who suffer from laryngeal dysfunction and to find trusted options that preserve their health and their quality of life. That's what this clinical trial is all about."</p>



<p>Kedian returns to Massachusetts next week. He is excited to be back with family and friends and to read bedtime stories to his granddaughter. Kedian also plans to use his own story to inspire others and be a voice for hope. "Mayo and Dr. Lott have helped me regain my quality of life," says Kedian. "My job now is to get better. My next job will be to show others they can do it too."</p>
