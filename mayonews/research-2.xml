<p><strong>Update 1-29-24: </strong> NASA has moved the launch of this mission to Tuesday, Jan. 30, subject to weather conditions and other factors.  You can watch for updates by following <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/event/nasas-northrop-grumman-crs-20-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA's launch schedule</a>. </p>

<p>A Mayo Clinic research experiment will be part of a payload that launches into space from NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/kennedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kennedy Space Center</a> in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Jan. 29, subject to weather conditions and other factors. The research team from the lab of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zubair-abba-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-00092417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Abba Zubair</a> is preparing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stem cells</a> for the flight to test how the absence of gravity plays a role in bone loss.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Dr._Zubair_in_lab_2017_1504453_3696200_0018R-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-380366" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Dr._Zubair_in_lab_2017_1504453_3696200_0018R-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Dr._Zubair_in_lab_2017_1504453_3696200_0018R.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Abba Zubair</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We've known for some time that astronauts lose bone density on long-duration space flights," says Dr. Zubair, a laboratory medicine and pathology specialist at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "We want to understand how this occurs so we can work on solutions that prevent bone loss not only in astronauts while they're in space, but also in patients here on Earth."</p>



<p>The research project will examine the effect of gravity on a type of stem cells derived from bone marrow known as mesenchymal stem cells, or adult stem cells with growth factors and healing potential. They play a key role in tissue repair and regeneration. Dr. Zubair's team will look at how the stem cells function while in space. Dr. Zubair says the experiment could have implications for future space flights that include taking humans to Mars.</p>



<p>This early research also could affect human clinical trials down the road, perhaps a decade away, according to Dr. Zubair.</p>



<p>"We will use what we learn from this project to advance our research on the road to clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of testing therapeutic agents that can prevent or treat bone loss that comes with osteoporosis, as well as bone loss that occurs in patients who are bedridden for long periods of time," he says.</p>

<p>The research will be conducted during two space flights. The first space flight will evaluate the impact of microgravity on bone-forming stem cells. The second space flight is tentatively planned for the end of the year and will analyze the effect of microgravity on other cell types that participate in bone formation or loss. A compound will be tested that can be used to treat bone loss in space and potentially on Earth.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/blast-off-stem-cells-from-mayo-clinic-physicians-lab-launch-into-space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first foray into space</a> for Dr. Zubair's research was in 2017, when a payload of several samples of donated stem cells blasted off from Kennedy Space Center in a test to determine if they could hold up in space and be more quickly mass-produced in microgravity for use in stroke treatment. A subsequent research experiment in space found that <a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2020/06/18/stem-cells-in-space-interstellar-research-to-improve-regenerative-therapies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stem cells grown in weightlessness</a> are safe and feasible for applications to human disease.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is collaborating with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/center/bioserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bioserve Space Technologies</a> in Boulder, Colorado, which is providing the space flight hardware for the research project.</p>

<p>Bile duct cancer, also known as cholangiocarcinoma, forms in the thin tubes that carry bile from your liver to your gallbladder and small intestine. Though relatively rare, cholangiocarcinoma is often diagnosed in later stages, making it more difficult to treat, and cases in the U.S. are increasing.</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-023-00770-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review article</a>&nbsp;published in Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology in 2023, lead author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ilyas-sumera-i-m-b-b-s/bio-20258409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sumera I. Ilyas, M.B.B.S.</a>, and co-authors share advances in diagnosing, staging and treating bile duct cancer. Dr. Ilyas is a Mayo Clinic physician-scientist and a transplant hepatologist whose&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ilyas-sumera-i-m-b-b-s/bio-10031656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;focuses on the immunobiology of liver cancer. Here is a summary of their review:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The immune microenvironment of bile duct tumors promotes their growth.</h2>



<p>Dr. Ilyas says bile duct cancers have distinct tumor immune microenvironments (TIMEs). Researchers have begun to understand the complexity of these TIMEs and their relationship with the three different types of cholangiocarcinoma —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intrahepatic, hilar and distal</a>. The TIMEs of bile duct cancer have fewer cytotoxic cells — immune cells that help kill mutated and cancerous cells— and more cells that suppress the immune system. TIMEs may affect how the disease progresses and whether it can be treated with immunotherapy.</p>



<p>The genetic profile of different segments of bile duct tumors can also vary, known as heterogeneity. This makes it more challenging to target characteristics of the tumor for treatment.</p>



<p>Researchers are trying to understand how TIMEs help bile duct cancer grow and progress, evade the immune system and resist chemotherapy. Altering the TIME could make treatments more effective, &nbsp;including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune checkpoint inhibitors</a>&nbsp;and other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunotherapy</a>&nbsp;treatments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blood and bile samples may help diagnose bile duct cancer earlier.</h2>



<p>Diagnosing bile duct cancer early, when it's easier to treat, is a challenge. This is partly because cancer experts don't yet have the right tests and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/biomarker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biomarkers</a>&nbsp;to detect cholangiocarcinoma. "Efforts to identify better biomarkers to help diagnose the disease at an early stage and help gauge response to treatment are important," explains Dr. Ilyas. "Currently, there is a great deal of ongoing research focused on the use of tumor DNA in diagnosing and monitoring cholangiocarcinoma in patients receiving treatment."</p>



<p>Dr. Ilyas says research has identified potential biomarkers for cholangiocarcinoma. Researchers are now studying how biomarkers obtained through blood and bile samples from patients can help improve cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis. They are also looking for ways to detect and monitor tumors using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/liquid-biopsy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liquid biopsies</a>, which use DNA that breaks away from the tumor to circulate in bodily fluids like blood or bile. "Although we anticipate that liquid biopsy may enhance early detection of cholangiocarcinoma, larger scale studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bile duct cancer treatments are improving.</h2>



<p>"Systemic treatment options for cholangiocarcinoma were once quite limited and not very effective," says Dr. Ilyas. Systemic therapies are drugs used to treat cancer, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted therapy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunotherapy</a>.</p>



<p>Targeted therapies are drugs targeting mutations that control how cancer cells grow, divide and spread. With a better understanding of the different genetic profiles of bile duct cancer subtypes, cancer experts are developing new treatments tailored to specific types of cholangiocarcinoma. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several new drugs that target specific genetic mutations associated with bile duct tumor growth. "The emergence of targeted therapies has broadened treatment options and, in doing so, given much more hope to our patients," says Dr. Ilyas.</p>



<p>Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system to attack cancer. While immunotherapy has not yet proven effective for treating cholangiocarcinoma, Dr. Ilyas says ongoing research to identify biomarkers and to understand why bile duct cancer doesn't respond to immunotherapy may improve outcomes.</p>



<p>Researchers are also studying liver transplants as a treatment option for cholangiocarcinoma in select patients with certain tumor types. However, Dr. Ilyas says this form of treatment needs further research.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have unraveled the molecular mechanisms that affect which&nbsp; cells infected with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/symptoms-causes/syc-20373524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</a> die and which survive, a discovery heralded as a step toward eliminating all HIV-infected cells from the body.</p>



<p>This pioneering research goes beyond two common approaches to treating HIV infections. The first approach is to block HIV proteins, thereby preventing HIV cell replication. The second is to prevent HIV from reaching cells. However, neither treatment reduces the number of cells in the body that contain HIV, and these cells, also known as the HIV reservoir, are resistant to all current therapies. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"This research takes a new approach to eliminate HIV-infected cells. Our premise was that if we could understand how some HIV infected cells die following acute HIV infection, then we could design medical interventions which cause most HIV infected cells to die," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/badley-andrew-d-m-d/bio-00026694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Badley, M.D.</a>, senior author of the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings of this decade long Mayo Clinic research are published in the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36448802/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Virology</a>.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Research to understand HIV proteins</strong></h2>



<p>The key to unlocking the mystery of what causes HIV-infected cells to die or survive is understanding how HIV proteins bind with other proteins inside the cell. When a cell is infected with HIV, that cell produces a protein called Casp8p41. Previously the Mayo research team discovered that Casp8p41 causes the HIV-infected cell to die. However not all HIV-infected cells die because Casp8p41 can bind to a human protein called Bcl2, which neutralizes Casp8p41. The team discovered if Casp8p41 binds to Bcl2, then the HIV-infected cells survive. However, if Casp8p41 does not bind to Bcl2 then the infected cell dies, and the number of HIV-infected cells diminish.</p>



<p>"Our team found that what determines whether or not a cell lives or die is how much of those two proteins they have," says Dr. Badley.</p>



<p>Researchers applied this discovery to probe whether a Bcl2 inhibitor could eliminate HIV-infected cells in mouse models by blocking Bcl2 from binding to Casp8p41. Bcl2 inhibitors have shown similar properties against blood cancers.</p>



<p>This research demonstrated that the Bcl2 inhibitor has potential for killing infected cells, including "sleeper" cells that harbor HIV and reducing the HIV reservoir.</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic team is one of the first, if not the first, to move this research into mice implanted with human immune systems and infected with HIV. Dr. Badley's team compared the cells of mice receiving the Bcl2 inhibitor to cells from a control group of mice without the inhibitor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A disease with no cure</strong></h2>



<p>HIV causes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/symptoms-causes/syc-20373524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)</a>, a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition that destroys cells that coordinate the immune system, weakening it. HIV can be suppressed with combination of drugs, known as antiretroviral therapy, that reduces replication of HIV-infected cells. Antiretroviral therapy does not kill infected cells or reduce the size of the HIV reservoir, which could become active at any time, producing new HIV.</p>



<p>"Data in our study confirm meaningful anti-HIV effects of the Bcl2 inhibitor during HIV infection in humanized mouse models. Our hope is that this research will contribute to an eventual cure for HIV," says Dr. Badley.</p>



<p>More study is needed to confirm these findings.</p>

<p>Katy Lydon was in fifth grade when she became enthralled with engineering. A team of engineers visited her classroom and led an exercise in designing, building and testing miniature towers made out of cardboard. But she didn’t associate engineering with medicine until the end of high school. "I didn't truly learn about biomedical engineering until my senior year," she says of the field that became her passion, "and I wished I'd been introduced to it earlier."</p>



<p>Now a third-year Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School for Biomedical Sciences</a>, Lydon conducts research under the mentorship of orthopedic surgeon <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/saris-daniel-b-f-m-d-ph-d/bio-20421026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Saris, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, whose basic science lab specializes in restoring function to injured joints through cell and tissue repair, especially for knee injuries. Even as Lydon conducts experiments, she remains interested in educating others about what biomedical engineers do. So, when the National Institutes of Health announced its annual contest to introduce biomedical engineering concepts to middle schoolers, Lydon was all-in. She set out to draft a classroom plan.</p>



<p>"I knew it would be out of my comfort zone," she says, "but I loved that the NIH is aiming to introduce kids early to engineering — and to biomedical engineering, specifically." This month she learned the lesson plans she developed were among five national winners of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering contest — known as the Biomedical Engineering Adapted for Middle Schoolers (BEAMS) Challenge — with a $5,000 prize. Through the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the winning lesson plans will be provided free for teachers around the country to use in their classrooms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Connecting with kids (and keeping their attention)</strong></h2>



<p>As a graduate student, Lydon's research focuses on restoring a torn meniscus, a knee injury that's notoriously challenging to treat. The team in Dr. Saris' lab studies various approaches to generate new tissue for the knee and also conducts biomechanical tests to understand the durability of the engineered product. When Lydon decided to develop lesson plans for middle schoolers, she chose the topic of "biomaterials" — natural or synthesized substances that can be used to solve medical issues. Biomaterials can include the metals or ceramics used in a hip replacement or even the polymer scaffold used as a base to grow engineered tissue.</p>



<p>The first challenge she faced, however, was finding an approach that would make sense to young students. "The way we think as researchers is very different from the way you have to address a middle school classroom," she acknowledges. "There's so much information that goes into knowing what a biomaterial is, how it's used, what its properties are, but in this case, you need to use vocabulary middle schoolers use. And you have to keep them focused."</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Pierret_Christopher_K._13919148_202105251044-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379839" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Pierret_Christopher_K._13919148_202105251044-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/Pierret_Christopher_K._13919148_202105251044.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christopher Pierret, Ph.D., serves as assistant dean of academic affairs of Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>After packing a PowerPoint with information, Lydon realized quickly she had to pare back and share details students could engage with and retain. She worked closely with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pierret-christopher-k-ph-d/bio-00028021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christopher Pierret, Ph.D.</a>, assistant dean of academic affairs, who also leads the Mayo-initiated science-training program <a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2021/09/14/scientists-teachers-partner-to-bring-science-experiences-to-students/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">InSciEd Out</a> that takes place in schools. Dr. Pierret encouraged Lydon to include hands-on activities for the students.</p>



<p>"What's exciting about the BEAMS initiative is the intent to connect classroom education to the cutting-edge of science related to biomedical engineering, but it's an initiative that's great for the entrants, too," Dr. Pierret says. "It's a fantastic opportunity for new scientists to experience curriculum-writing. Our graduate school encourages students to broaden their competencies for paths after graduation. In a short period of time, Katy learned about education practice, theory and strategy."</p>



<p>Lydon also met individually with two teachers from Rochester-area schools and shared her draft lesson plans. "They were honest and gave open feedback," Lydon says. "They were able to say, 'No the students won't sit for this' or 'the small groups need to be smaller.' I knew going into the meetings with them that a lot of what I'd developed was going to have to change before I had a final product. Their input was incredibly valuable."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The materials doctors use to help patients</strong></h2>



<p>In the first of four 45-minute lessons, Lydon's classroom plan invites students to sort different biomaterials they find in a box, identifying what the objects are made of and describing their properties. As they learn specific types of biomaterials, such as metal, ceramic or polymer, they learn how the materials are used by doctors to help patients. (Some materials make good stents, as Lydon explains, while others make good prosthetic joints.)</p>



<p>All along, students are prompted to think about questions such as the advantages and disadvantages of certain materials, how their properties help with their intended function and even the environmental impact of each substance. After doing short readings, sharing information in small groups and even playing a Jeopardy-style game about biomaterials, the students' learning culminates in designing a mock device out of pipe cleaners and other easily accessible items that could address a medical problem.</p>



<p>The two middle school teachers Lydon consulted with expressed interest in using the lesson plans. "They were very enthusiastic about trying this out," she says.</p>



<p>Ultimately, her participation in the contest is important for the field, and for Mayo, too, says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/griffiths-leigh-g-ph-d-mrcvs/bio-20359632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leigh Griffiths, MRCVS, Ph.D.</a>, dean of the graduate school. "We all play a role in sharing the importance of science, even with the youngest learners, and training the workforce of the future," he says.</p>



<p>For Lydon, the joy was in creating a middle school experience she wished she'd had as a kid. "It was great to think about relaying these complex topics in a way that middle schoolers can understand, whether it's dealing with a broken bone or healing a knee, and sharing how biomedical engineering can be used to solve problems that matter to all of us," she says.</p>

<p>There are several <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> subtypes. The growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer, the most common subtype, is driven by female hormones. Another common subtype, HER2-positive breast cancer, has excessive copies of a gene called HER2 that makes its cells grow more than they should.</p>



<p>Triple-negative breast cancer, also called basal-like breast cancer, is a subtype that isn't affected by hormones or the HER2 gene. It grows rapidly, is more likely to spread beyond the breast before diagnosis and is more likely to recur than other breast cancers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20340746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20340746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon Ferre, M.D</a>.</a>, a Mayo Clinic oncologist whose research focuses on triple-negative breast cancer, says recent advances are improving treatment outcomes for people with this disease. "This subtype represents about 15% of all breast cancers," says Dr. Leon Ferre.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>"It's a bit more common at younger ages and in African American women, Hispanic women and women of Indian descent. We also see this subtype more commonly in women who have a genetic mutation predisposing them to breast cancer — the BRCA1 mutation, in particular."</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">ROBERTO LEON FERRE, M.D.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre and other researchers at Mayo Clinic are working to understand how triple-negative breast cancer grows and spreads, how the immune system may recognize and fight it, and to develop new treatments for the disease. If you've been diagnosed with this breast cancer subtype, here’s what you should know:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is triple-negative breast cancer?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/roberto-leon-ferre-15303209-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379817" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/roberto-leon-ferre-15303209-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/roberto-leon-ferre-15303209.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Roberto Leon Ferre, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We do three tests on every breast cancer tumor to help us select treatment: The estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2. If those three tests are negative, the cancer is considered triple-negative breast cancer," says Dr. Leon Ferre.</p>



<p>Confirming a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer starts with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-biopsy/about/pac-20384812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biopsy</a>, a procedure to remove a sample of breast tissue for testing. Your care team will send your tissue to the laboratory for analysis to determine cell type, aggressiveness (grade) and whether the cancer cells have hormone receptors.</p>



<p>Hormone receptors are proteins that can attach to a specific hormone. Some breast cancer cells have receptors for the female hormone estrogen and need it to grow. These breast cancers can be treated with anti-estrogen hormone (endocrine) therapy to block their growth.</p>



<p>The lab will also analyze your cancer cells' genetic makeup to determine if they are HER2-positive or have other tumor markers. HER2-positive cancers have too many copies of the HER2 gene, which causes them to produce too much of the HER2 growth-promoting protein. These breast cancers can be treated with drugs that target the HER2 protein in cancer cells to slow those cells' growth and kill them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is triple-negative breast cancer treated?</h2>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre says that for some types of breast cancer, chemotherapy is used after surgery and sometimes not at all. This is not the case for triple-negative breast cancer. "The vast majority of women with this diagnosis will need chemotherapy, and we almost always treat with chemotherapy before surgery," he says.</p>



<p>With other breast cancers, chemotherapy is given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast.</p>



<p>"Triple-negative breast cancer tends to spread at a microscopic level from the beginning," says Dr. Leon Ferre. This means the cancer must be treated with&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2021/12/16/the-4-types-of-systemic-therapy-for-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">systemic therapy</a>&nbsp;— a drug or combination of drugs that can be taken orally or through an IV to reach cancer cells in all parts of the body. "The drugs usually used to avoid chemotherapy target estrogen receptors. This cancer doesn't have those, so we rely on chemotherapy, which essentially kills any cell that is dividing rapidly," he says.</p>



<p>Another systemic therapy used to treat triple-negative breast cancer is&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/11/29/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-immunotherapy-for-people-with-triple-negative-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunotherapy</a>, drugs that help your immune system identify and kill cancer cells. "At this time, it's the only type of breast cancer for which we use immunotherapy. Of all breast cancer subtypes, it's the one that's better able to alert the immune system to its presence. We can take advantage of that and use medications to activate the immune system further to attack the cancer," says Dr. Leon Ferre.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">ROBERTO LEON FERRE, M.D.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The immunotherapy approved for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer is called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/pembrolizumab-intravenous-route/description/drg-20122552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pembrolizumab</a>. It can be used with chemotherapy or other medicines before surgery and then continued alone after surgery to treat early stage, triple-negative breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. It can also treat triple-negative breast cancer that produces the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/pd-l1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PD-L1 protein</a>&nbsp;and cannot be surgically removed.</p>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic testing</a>&nbsp;can identify additional treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer. "There are some medications that work only in people that have certain genetic mutations, so it's important to ask for genetic testing — even if you don't have a family history of breast cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What should I ask my care team about triple-negative breast cancer?</h2>



<p>Before deciding on a treatment plan, Dr. Leon Ferre recommends asking your care team these questions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>What is the goal of my treatment?</strong><br>He says everyone diagnosed with cancer should ask their care team this question. "It's important to know if treatments are likely to cure the cancer or if treatment will be about controlling the cancer."</li>



<li><strong>Are clinical trials an option?<br></strong>If available treatments are unlikely to achieve a cure, consider clinical trials. "There have been many advances in triple-negative breast cancer research, and there are a lot of newer medications that work against this cancer," he says. Participating in a&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/05/23/is-a-cancer-clinical-trial-right-for-me/">clinical trial</a>&nbsp;may provide treatment options you may not otherwise have.</li>



<li><strong>Is immunotherapy an option?</strong><br>Immunotherapy can treat cancer by blocking immune checkpoints, the part of the immune system that prevents an immune response from being so strong that it destroys a body’s healthy cells. Dr. Leon Ferre says you should ask about immunotherapy if your care team doesn't mention it. Depending on the situation, you may need a test called PD-L1 to decide if immunotherapy would be a good option.</li>



<li><strong>What are the possible side effects of treatment?</strong><br>Before deciding on a treatment plan, it's crucial to understand the side effects of any treatment. "Understanding the potential side effects will help you anticipate how you will feel and prepare beforehand. Every cancer patient should ask about treatment side effects," he says.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are new treatments being developed for triple-negative breast cancer?</h2>



<p>Researchers are studying several new types of immunotherapy with the potential to treat triple-negative breast cancer. "These therapies are promising, and because they work differently than the immunotherapy now available, they are likely to help patients that do not qualify for that drug," says Dr. Leon Ferre. "We also have made progress in a class of drugs called antibody-drug conjugates. These treatments link a small amount of chemotherapy to modified antibodies — naturally occurring proteins that help fight infections. The antibodies have been modified to recognize specific portions of the tumor, instead of bacteria or viruses, and are attached to a small dose of chemotherapy. This allows chemotherapy delivery to tumor cells while sparing cells that aren’t cancerous. These drugs seem to be more potent than traditional chemotherapy."</p>



<p>Researchers have also made advances in the development of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted therapies</a>&nbsp;for triple-negative breast cancer. These drugs target proteins that control how cancer cells grow, divide and spread. "These treatments are for patients with certain genetic mutations — some targeted therapies specifically block those mutations," says Dr. Leon Ferre. "Some of these drugs are oral and have fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy. So, we may be able to treat some patients with targeted-drug therapies and perhaps have phases of treatment where they don't need chemotherapy. These drugs can be much better tolerated and usually don't cause nausea or hair loss."</p>



<p>Dr. Leon Ferre and his colleagues at Mayo Clinic are conducting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/search-results?keyword=triple-negative%20breast%20cancer&amp;studySiteStatusesGrouped=Open%2FStatus%20Unknown#0c1d955fe5494ae68c25c6f1aad733c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trials</a>&nbsp;of targeted therapies for triple-negative breast cancer. "We're working on ways to identify patients that may do well with less or no chemotherapy. We're finding immune markers that may allow us to identify patients with early stage cancer with such a good prognosis that they may need less intensive chemotherapy."</p>

<p>If you've been diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, Dr. Leon Ferre wants you to know that it's treatable. "It's very sensitive to chemotherapy. With the incorporation of immunotherapy and some newer drugs, we're seeing higher cure rates for patients with early stage breast cancer. And we have new treatments for patients with metastatic breast cancer. We're making a lot of progress."</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center and Columbia University recently announced being named  the recipients of a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-columbia-university-receive-10-6-million-grant-from-nci-to-advance-glioblastoma-research-with-mathematical-oncology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$10.6 million grant from the National Cancer</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-and-columbia-university-receive-10-6-million-grant-from-nci-to-advance-glioblastoma-research-with-mathematical-oncology/"> Institute</a> to advance research in fighting glioblastoma - one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms of brain cancer. </p>



<p>Every year, thousands are diagnosed with the disease. Many are given little time to live. The prognosis is often poorer for older patients.</p>



<p>Researchers are searching for a cure. Meanwhile a team at Mayo Clinic is also looking for ways to help elderly patients diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-is-glioblastoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a> live longer and maintain quality of life. </p>



<p>Now, an investigational study at Mayo Clinic using an innovative approach to treatment has shown promise in improving health outcomes for people like Richard Casper.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Love at first sight</h2>



<p>Richard and Carol Casper were in their early 20s when they met. Carol was smitten, but not sure Richard would call her again.</p>



<p>"So, anyway, he did," recalls Carol with a twinkle in her eye. "That's where it all started in 1962, and we got married in 1964." </p>



<p>Children soon followed, and their family began traveling the world with Richard's career in the U.S. Air Force.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="802" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-802x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378587" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-802x1024.png 802w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-235x300.png 235w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM-768x981.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.29.14-AM.png 844w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Richard and Carol on their wedding day in 1964</strong>                                                                                                                                                 Photo courtesy: Casper family</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The day their world changed&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After nearly 30 years of military service, the couple was looking forward to retirement. Then suddenly, in 2019, Richard suffered a seizure and their world came crashing down. Testing began to identify the cause of his seizures. </p>



<p>Ultimately surgery confirmed the family's worst fear - brain cancer.</p>



<p>"That's when we got the definite diagnosis that it was <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-is-glioblastoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma, stage 4,</a>" says Carol. Doctors told the family Richard had less than a year to live.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We were hit with a bomb."</p><cite>Carol Casper, Richard's wife</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Glioblastoma: The deadliest form of brain cancer&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Glioblastoma is one of the most complex and fast-growing forms of brain cancer. It is also the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, though it can strike at any age. It can form in the spinal cord or the brain.</p>



<p>"It carries the worst prognosis, and it has to do with the aggressiveness of the cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist with Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona. "Despite our best treatments, we see patients continue to recur, which requires additional treatments over time." &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://braintumor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Brain Tumor Society</a>, more than 14,490 Americans are expected to be diagnosed in 2023. They estimate approximately 10,000 will die from the disease.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research to improve patient outcomes</h2>



<p>Dr. Vora has been researching brain tumors and ways to improve patient outcomes for the past two decades. His team is now investigating an innovative treatment protocol for elderly patients, like Richard, who are often given less time than average to live. </p>



<p>"Most of these patients are in the six- to nine-month range," says Dr. Vora. "We're looking for ways of providing more effective and better treatments for patients in terms of both quality and quantity of life."</p>



<p>Richard sought treatment at Mayo Clinic in Arizona under the care of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-alyx-b-m-d/bio-20055164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alyx Porter, M.D</a>., a neuro-oncologist. "When people come in, it is one of the scariest times in their life," says Dr. Porter. "My job is to provide them with comfort, reassurance and direction as to what the next steps will be."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Let me do the worrying, and you all do the living."</p><cite>Neuro-oncologist Dr. Alyx Porter speaking to the Casper family</cite></blockquote></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic's multidisciplinary approach</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic's healthcare model is based on a team approach. Physicians from a variety of disciplines work together to explore the best treatment options for a patient and deliver the highest level of care.</p>



<p>Richard's family was aware there was likely no cure. What&nbsp;they wanted was more time than his prognosis.&nbsp;His healthcare team agreed Richard was an ideal candidate for the clinical trial. Richard told doctors he was ready to be a participant.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Sign me up. I just need to get my balance back, and I think I'll be able to roll with the punch."&nbsp;</p><cite>Richard Casper </cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Targeting cancer cells with advanced medical imaging</h2>



<p>Radiation and chemotherapy are often used to try and slow progression of the cancer. The study is investigating an innovative approach researchers hope will help elderly glioblastoma patients live longer with fewer symptoms of the cancer and side effects from treatment.</p>



<p>It incorporates the use of an advanced medical imaging technique, called 18F-DOPA PET and MRI to target specific areas of the brain for treatment and spare healthy tissue.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="557" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1024x557.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378592" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1024x557.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-300x163.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-768x418.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-1536x836.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.45.43-AM-2048x1114.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Dr. Vora showing how 18F-DOPA PET/MRI is being studied as a way to help improve treatment of glioblastoma</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"18F-DOPA is more or less a special type of sugar that cancer cells take at a faster rate compared to healthy cells that is very specific for glioblastoma. So, with this PET scan, we can actually now identify areas in the brain that are felt to be at highest risk for tumor growth," says Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>The other critical part of this regimen is that it's much more convenient for patients. "Instead of the traditional three to six weeks' worth of radiation, we're able to complete their entire treatment in one to two weeks, which allows more time for patients to stay with their family," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p>The areas are then targeted with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-proton-beam-therapy-bolsters-cancer-treatment/">proton beam therapy</a> to destroy cancer cells. Proton beam therapy is innovative technology that can painlessly deliver higher doses of radiation, in a shorter amount of time, with fewer side effects. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="566" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1024x566.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378595" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1024x566.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-300x166.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-768x424.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-1536x849.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-1.57.48-AM-2048x1131.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Proton beam therapy delivers higher doses of radiation in shorter amounts of time often with fewer side effects</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I felt great," says Richard after completing his treatment. "I wouldn't even know I have a brain tumor right now if someone didn't tell me so." </p>



<p>Dr. Porter credits the study's treatment protocol. "With the shorter course of treatment, it saved him from many of the side effects that we know can be as devastating as the disease itself. He was able to finish the treatment, unscathed, walking and dancing into my office thrilled at how good he actually felt."&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Richard beats the odds&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Richard survived almost twice longer than his original prognosis while maintaining his quality of life. "My dad defied the odds and kept going," says Susan, Richard's daughter. "To be almost 2 ½ years in after being told you only have a few months left to live, is quite remarkable."</p>

<p>The Casper family says they're proud of Richard's courage to help in the fight against cancer. "What he went through, and even during the trial, made a big difference in helping other people," says Carol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Richard maintained his valiant battle till the end. He died on March 8, 2023.&nbsp;"All of us at Mayo feel very fortunate to have known Mr. Casper," says Dr. Vora. "He was a very special person."</p>



<p>Dr. Vora presented results of the trial at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology. </p>



<p>"The results are quite promising," says Dr. Vora. "We're hoping to see these results carried on in a larger-scale study. If we continue to see the same types of results, we feel it could be a good option moving forward for all cancer patients."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers make new discoveries, develop first-of-its-kind tools and technologies and constantly improve upon existing ones with the goal to provide the best in healthcare. The following 10 stories are a round-up of some of the most significant medical research advances at Mayo Clinic this year from harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to detect disease sooner to advancing treatments for rare and complex diseases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advancing ultrasound microvessel imaging and AI to improve cancer detection</strong></h2>

<p>Tumors consist not only of cancer cells but also a matrix of small blood vessels, or microvessels, that cannot be seen in the images produced by conventional ultrasound machines. To solve this problem, physician-scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/alizad-azra-m-d/bio-00085586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azra Alizad, M.D.</a>, and biomedical engineering scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fatemi-mostafa-ph-d/bio-00086282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostafa Fatemi, Ph.D.</a>, teamed up at Mayo Clinic to design and study a tool that may improve the resolution of ultrasound imaging. As demonstrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, they developed high-resolution ultrasound imaging software, compatible with many ultrasound machines, that could exponentially improve both the detail and quality of images.</p>



<p>"If we can visualize and capture the microvessel in the earliest stages of cancer, we can better diagnose and treat it earlier, which improves the outcome for the patient," says Dr. Alizad, who specializes in ultrasound technology for cancer imaging.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/10/11/advancing-ultrasound-microvessel-imaging-and-ai-to-improve-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Harnessing the immune system to fight ovarian cancer</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Mayo Clinic research is biomanufacturing an experimental, cell-based ovarian cancer vaccine and combining it with immunotherapy to study a "one-two punch" approach to halting disease progression in ovarian cancer patients. This research begins with a blood draw from women with advanced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>&nbsp;whose tumors have returned after standard surgery and chemotherapy. White blood cells are extracted from the blood, biomanufactured to become dendritic cells and are returned to the patient. Dendritic cells act as crusaders that march through the body, triggering the immune system to recognize and fight cancer.</p>



<p>"We're building on an earlier phase 1 clinical trial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18962-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that showed promising results</a>&nbsp;in terms of survival after the dendritic cell-based vaccine," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, co-principal investigator and medical oncologist. "Of the 18 evaluable patients in the phase 1 study, 11 had cancer return, but seven of them — 40%&nbsp;— have been cancer-free for almost 10 years. We typically expect 90% of patients in this condition to have the cancer return."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/19/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-ovarian-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Mayo Clinic prepares to biomanufacture a new CAR-T cell therapy for B-cell blood cancers</strong></strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="225" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/CAR-T-shutterstock_686272324-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-379556" /></figure></div>


<p>Mayo Clinic research has developed a new type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</a>&nbsp;aimed at killing B-cell blood cancers that have returned and are no longer responding to treatment. This pioneering technology, designed and developed in the lab of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, killed B-cell tumors grown in the laboratory and tumors implanted in mouse models. The preclinical findings are published in&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00262-023-03537-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy</a>.</p>



<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."&nbsp;<a href="https://regenerativemedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/11/mayo-clinic-prepares-to-biomanufacture-a-new-car-t-cell-therapy-for-b-cell-blood-cancers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Colonoscopy remains the gold standard in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer. But the procedure has limitations. Some studies suggest that&nbsp;more than half&nbsp;of post-colonoscopy colon cancer cases arise from lesions that were missed at patients’ previous colonoscopies.</p>



<p>"AI, particularly the subset of AI called computer vision, is naturally suited to what we do through the endoscope," says Michael B. Wallace, M.D., who describes himself as a bit of a technology geek.</p>



<p>In 2022, Dr. Wallace&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35304117/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published the results</a>&nbsp;of an international, multicenter study testing the impact of adding AI to routine colonoscopies. His team, which included James East, M.D., a gastroenterologist at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London</a>, as well as researchers from the U.S., the U.K., Italy, Germany and Ireland, found that incorporating AI into colonoscopies reduced the risk of missing polyps by 50%.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/02/03/artificial-intelligence-is-forging-a-new-future-for-gastroenterology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Just months after 9-year-old Mayo Clinic patient Maggie Carmichael started taking an experimental drug for her ultra-rare genetic disease that is part of a category of diseases known as<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/clinical-genomics/overview/specialty-groups/cdg-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;congenital disorders of glycosylation</a>, she was able to trade in her wheelchair for a walker. Maggie’s treating physician is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/morava-kozicz-eva-m-d-ph-d/bio-20431520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eva Morava-Kozicz, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a translational scientist at Mayo Clinic who&nbsp;is at the forefront of research on congenital disorders of glycosylation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34652821/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent discovery</a>, Dr. Morava-Kozicz and her collaborators found that one of the major culprits of congenital disorders of glycosylation is a buildup of a substance called sorbitol, which is a type of sugar alcohol that is produced in the body when glucose is metabolized. Dr. Morava-Kozicz says the sorbitol discovery opened the door to a diagnostic biomarker for the disease and for tracking disease severity. She says the biomarker advancement provided a strategy for implementing potential drug candidates.&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/03/01/mayo-clinic-discovery-leads-to-life-changing-treatment-for-young-girl-with-ultra-rare-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Clinicians and researchers around the world are combining artificial intelligence, known as AI, with health care to help identify patients at greater risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ai-cardiology/overview/ovc-20486648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke and heart failure.</a>&nbsp;However, as use of these AI-enhanced tools grows, researchers at Mayo Clinic are asking, "Do these tools work reliably for people of color?" and "Are they accessible in community health care settings?"</p>



<p>"AI-based health interventions are frequently developed and deployed without race-specific data analysis or validation," says David Harmon, M.D., Mayo Clinic cardiology fellow. "It's important to make sure these tools are reliable and accessible to all, particularly people of color who are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/health-disparities-and-inequities">disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease</a>."&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2023/01/24/can-ai-enhanced-heart-screening-address-health-disparities/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have identified a diverse range of environmental chemicals in human bile in patients with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary sclerosing cholangitis</a>, a rare, chronic liver disease of the bile ducts. The&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36687160/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, published in Exposome<em>,</em>&nbsp;represents a new frontier of research at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a>&nbsp;that explores the exposome, the measure of environmental contributors to disease and health. For the study, researchers investigated bile samples from patients with the disease using high-resolution mass spectrometry and found various environmental chemicals. This new technology allowed researchers to measure and analyze external chemical exposures and their biological responses, with enough coverage to study the relationships between potential disease drivers and their effects.</p>



<p>"The findings of the derived chemical-metabolomic links in the bile serve as a starting point," says Mayo Clinic researcher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lazaridis-konstantinos-n-m-d/bio-00085288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Konstantinos N.

<p>Here's a look back at 10 (of many) of Mayo Clinic’s influential precision medicine research studies of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Mayo Clinic organoid study reveals possible key link to autism spectrum disorder</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft is-resized"><a href="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/cerebral-organoids2-002.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/cerebral-organoids2-002-1024x580.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13093" style="width:308px;height:auto" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Using miniaturized human brain models known as organoids, Mayo Clinic and Yale University scientists have discovered that the roots of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352928">autism spectrum disorder</a>&nbsp;may be associated with an imbalance of specific neurons that play a critical role in how the brain communicates and functions. The specific cells are known as excitatory cortical neurons. Led by &nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/abyzov-alexej-ph-d/bio-20089449">Alexej Abyzov, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;the new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01399-0">study</a>, published in Nature Neuroscience, reveals an abnormal imbalance of excitatory neurons in the forebrain of people with the disorder, with variations depending on their head size.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/08/10/mayo-clinic-mini-brain-study-reveals-possible-key-link-to-autism-spectrum-disorder/">Read more</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Mayo Clinic research uncovers epigenetic roots of digestive disorder associated with diabetes</strong></h3>

<p>In a new preclinical study, scientists at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/research/programs/precision-cancer-therapeutics">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a>&nbsp;have discovered insights into the root cause of diabetic gastroparesis. Published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508523048886">Gastroenterology</a>, the study, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ordog-tamas-m-d/bio-00095251">Tamas Ordog, M.D</a>., zeroed in on a gene-regulating protein in the gastrointestinal tract called hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A), which is known to help cells respond to low oxygen levels. The scientists found that HIF1A is also a key factor in regulating an enzyme called neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) within stomach nerve cells. As a result of this discovery, Dr. Ordog suggests that targeting H1F1A may be a useful therapeutic strategy.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/10/05/mayo-clinic-research-uncovers-epigenetic-roots-of-a-digestive-disorder-associated-with-diabetes/">Read more</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Mayo Clinic researchers link ovarian cancer to bacteria colonization in microbiome</strong></h3>

<p>A specific colonization of microbes in the reproductive tract is commonly found in women with ovarian cancer, according to a new study from Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine">Center for Individualized Medicine</a>. Published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27555-x">Scientific Reports</a>&nbsp;and led by<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/walther-antonio-marina-r-ph-d/bio-20087609">&nbsp;Marina Walther-Antonio, Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;and Abigail Asangba, Ph.D., the discovery strengthens evidence that the bacterial component of the microbiome — a community of microorganisms that also consists of viruses, yeasts and fungi — is an important indicator for early detection, diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian cancer. The study also suggests that a higher accumulation of pathogenic microbes plays a role in treatment outcomes and could be a potential indicator for predicting a patient's prognosis and response to therapy.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/01/16/mayo-clinic-researchers-link-ovarian-cancer-to-bacteria-colonization-in-microbiome/">Read more</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Could antidepressants cause treatment-emergent mania?</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright is-resized"><a href="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/antidepressants2.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.prod-carehubs.net/n1/aea970a4ae5d5c88/uploads/2023/12/antidepressants2-1024x490.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13096" style="width:359px;height:auto" /></a></figure></div>


<p>In a new Mayo Clinic study, researchers have pinpointed a potential risk linked to antidepressants that boost mitochondrial energetics — a process responsible for extracting energy from nutrients to sustain cellular life. The findings suggest that such antidepressants may elevate the risk of treatment-emergent mania. The heightened energy expenditure during mania is linked to impulsivity, poor judgment, psychosis, and a loss of insight, often leading to high-risk behaviors that can result in hospitalization or incarceration. Published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01888-x">Molecular Psychiatry</a>, the study, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/frye-mark-a-m-d/bio-00077016">Mark Frye, M.D.</a>, specifically investigated the risk of treatment-emergent mania in people with bipolar disorder undergoing antidepressant treatment. The data suggest categorizing antidepressants based on mitochondrial energetics may be of value.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/01/24/could-antidepressants-cause-treatment-emergent-mania/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>The Tapestry study, an extensive and decentralized genomic sequencing clinical research study, aims to complete exome sequencing for 100,000 Mayo Clinic patients. The results will be integrated into the patients’ Electronic Health Record for three hereditary conditions, and the amassed data will contribute to a distinctive research dataset stored within the Mayo Clinic Cloud on the Omics Data Platform. The overall hope of Tapestry is to accelerate discoveries in individualized medicine to tailor prevention, diagnosis and treatment to a patient's unique genetic makeup. It is poised to advance evidence that exome sequencing, when applied to a diverse and comprehensive general population, can proficiently identify carriers of genetic variants that put them at higher risk for a disease so that they can take preventative measures.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/03/21/a-big-step-forward-bringing-dna-sequencing-data-to-routine-patient-care/">Read more</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Mayo Clinic discovery leads to diagnoses of 9 people with rare form of muscular dystrophy</strong></h3>

<p>Nine people around the world who have been living with unexplained, muscular dystrophy-like symptoms may now have an answer for what is causing the progressive muscle weakness in their body’s mid-section, arms and legs. In a new discovery, a collaborative team of scientists led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;has pinpointed alterations in a single gene deep inside these people's genetic blueprint as the root cause of their ultra-rare disorder, known as&nbsp;<a href="https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6907/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy">limb-girdle muscular dystrophy</a>. For some, the onset of debilitating muscle-wasting symptoms began in childhood, while others started having trouble walking, running, climbing stairs and breathing in adulthood. The new study describing their discovery is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929723001301">published</a>&nbsp;in the American Journal of Human Genetics.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/07/03/mayo-clinic-discovery-leads-to-diagnoses-of-9-people-with-rare-form-of-muscular-dystrophy/">Read more.</a></p>

<p>Scientists at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;have developed an artificial intelligence method, called Spatially Informed Artificial Intelligence (SPIN-AI). This new deep-learning technique can analyze the genetic information of individual cells to reconstruct the precise layout of the cells in a tissue, without preexisting knowledge of how the cells are organized.&nbsp; The scientists say their findings could potentially pave the way for individualized treatments that target the specific cellular traits of each person. The new study detailing SPIN-AI is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/13/6/895">published in Biomolecules</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/06/22/mayo-clinic-researchers-pioneer-ai-method-to-predict-how-cells-are-organized-in-disease-microenvironments/">Read more.</a></p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/taneja-veena-ph-d/bio-00027247">Veena Taneja, Ph.D.</a>, have discovered a link between an abundance of specific gut bacteria and the triggering of an immune response against a person's tissue. The new study, published in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37656793/">Science Advances</a>, reveals an immune response occurs even before the clinical symptoms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648">rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;appear. Using a preclinical model, the researchers determined that the gut bacteria Eggerthella lenta causes an autoimmune response before the onset of the clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. In that response, the immune system produces autoantibodies that mistakenly target and attack the body's tissues and cells instead of foreign invaders, such as bacteria or viruses.&nbsp;<a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/18/mayo-clinic-researchers-identify-link-between-gut-bacteria-and-pre-clinical-autoimmunity-and-aging-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/">Read more</a>.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have identified a key gene, CDCP1, linked to improvement in heart function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a common cause of heart failure. The study, the first genome-wide association of its kind, reveals that a genetic variation in CDCP1 influences susceptibility to the condition and response to therapies. The gene's connection to cardiac fibrosis and the biomarker known as sST2 opens avenues for potential drug therapies targeting CDCP1 to mitigate adverse effects of heart failure. The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37800334/">study</a>, led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pereira-naveen-l-m-d/bio-20178506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</a> is published in Circulation Research. <a href="https://individualizedmedicineblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/11/27/mayo-clinic-study-explores-heart-failure-uncovers-genes-role-in-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.  </p>
