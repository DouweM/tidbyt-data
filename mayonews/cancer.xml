It's the second-most common cancer diagnosed in women in the U.S., and it will affect 1 in 8 women, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. Much of the messaging around breast cancer research focuses on the disease in women. However, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374740?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer can occur in men</a> as well.</p>



<p>October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which makes this<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>a good time to learn about breast cancer in men.</p>



<p>An estimated 2,800 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in men in the U.S. this year, and about 530 men will die from the disease, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer-in-men/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. Men diagnosed with breast cancer at an early stage have a good chance for a cure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Signs and symptoms of male breast cancer can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>A painless lump or thickening in your breast tissue.</li>



<li>Changes to the skin covering your breast, such as dimpling, puckering, redness or scaling.</li>



<li>Changes to your nipple, such as redness or scaling, or a nipple that begins to turn inward.</li>



<li>Discharge from your nipple.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2>



<p>Factors that increase the risk of male breast cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Older age.</strong><br>The risk of breast cancer increases as you age. Male breast cancer is most often diagnosed in men in their 60s.</li>



<li><strong>Exposure to estrogen.</strong><br>If you take estrogen-related drugs, such as those used for hormone therapy for prostate cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased.</li>



<li><strong>Family history of breast cancer.</strong><br>If you have a close family member with breast cancer, you have a greater chance of developing the disease.</li>



<li><strong>Klinefelter syndrome.</strong><br>This genetic syndrome occurs when boys are born with more than one copy of the X chromosome. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/klinefelter-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353949?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Klinefelter syndrome</a> may adversely affect testicular growth, resulting in smaller than normal testicles, which can lead to lower production of testosterone.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Liver disease.</strong><br>Certain conditions, such as cirrhosis of the liver, can reduce male hormones and increase female hormones, increasing your risk of breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Obesity.</strong><br>Obesity is associated with higher levels of estrogen in the body, which increases the risk of male breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Testicle disease or surgery.</strong><br>Having inflamed testicles or surgery to remove a testicle can increase your risk of male breast cancer.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some men inherit mutated genes from their parents that increase the risk of breast cancer. Mutations in one of several genes, especially a gene called&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>, put you at greater risk of developing breast and prostate cancers.</p>



<p>If you have a strong family history of cancer, discuss this with your healthcare team. They may recommend that you meet with a genetic counselor in order to consider genetic testing to see if you carry genes that increase your risk of cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Male breast cancer&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-breast-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374745?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank">treatment</a>&nbsp;often involves surgery to remove the tumor and surrounding breast tissue. Radiation therapy, hormone therapy and chemotherapy also may be recommended. If you've been diagnosed with breast cancer, your treatment will be based on the stage of your cancer, your overall health and your preferences.</p>

<p>Most lumps or&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-understanding-thyroid-nodules/">nodules</a>&nbsp;in the thyroid, which is a gland in your neck, are not harmful and don't need treatment. But sometimes, they can grow bigger and cause problems like trouble swallowing. In those cases, doctors might need to do surgery to remove them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There's also a treatment called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/radiofrequency-ablation-therapy-for-large-benign-thyroid-nodules/mac-20439239">radiofrequency ablation</a>&nbsp;(RFA), which uses heat to make the nodules smaller.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/stan-marius-n-m-d/bio-20055065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Marius Stan</a>, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist, says this nonsurgical treatment for shrinking thyroid nodules offers patients a safe and highly successful procedure. He says Mayo Clinic also is researching how RFA may be used to treat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid cancer</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Radiofrequency ablation, which many people might simply call an RFA, is a way of targeting a specific part of the thyroid, an abnormal part, by delivering high energy into that specific area of the thyroid and destroying it," says Dr. Stan.</p>



<p>He says patients with enlarged, benign thyroid nodules are good candidates for RFA.</p>



<p>"Patients will have an inch and a half to two inches thyroid nodules in diameter that we think are reaching the point where a problem is present or is likely going to be present," Dr. Stan says.</p>

<p>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) works by works by using heat to shrink or destroy benign thyroid nodules.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Along with retaining thyroid function, there are other advantages.</p>



<p>"The benefit is that we can do it in the outpatient setting, without the scar on the neck," he says.</p>



<p>Treating thyroid nodules is one application for RFA. Mayo Clinic is one of the leading U.S. institutions to research using RFA for thyroid cancer treatment.</p>



<p>"We hope that this will also be able to destroy a thyroid cancer very specifically, as opposed to a surgical approach that would eliminate part of the thyroid," says Dr. Stan.</p>

<p>A breast self-exam is an inspection of your breasts that you do on your own. To help increase your breast awareness, you use your eyes and hands to regularly observe the look and feel of your breasts.</p>



<p>Many breast changes detected during a breast self-exam have benign causes. This means they are not caused by cancer. Other changes may signal something serious like breast cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A breast self-exam that you do for breast awareness helps you understand the usual look and feel of your breasts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These self-exams aren't as effective as routine <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammograms</a> in detecting <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> or improving survival for women who have breast cancer. </p>



<p>Still, many healthcare professionals believe there is value in women becoming familiar with their breasts so they understand what's typical for them and can promptly report changes to their healthcare teams.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does a breast lump feel like?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A breast lump is a growth of tissue that develops within your breast. It may be described as a mass, growth, swelling, thickness or fullness. A breast lump can vary in the way it looks and feels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many women find lumps or changes in their breasts at various points in their menstrual cycles. These are typical changes that occur, and finding a change or lump in your breast is not a reason to panic. Breasts often feel different in different places. The look and feel of your breasts will also change as you age.</p>



<p>Watch for these breast changes:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>A distinct lump with definite borders.</li>



<li>A thickened, slightly more prominent area in your breast that's different from surrounding breast tissue.</li>



<li>Breast pain or tenderness.</li>



<li>Nipple changes, such as a nipple pulled inward (nipple inversion) or spontaneous fluid discharge from your nipple.</li>



<li>One breast that's noticeably larger than the other.</li>



<li>Other breast changes, such as redness, dimpling or pitting of the skin.</li>
</ul>



<p>Sometimes, a breast lump is a sign of breast cancer. That's why you should seek prompt medical evaluation.&nbsp;However, many breast lumps result from noncancerous (benign) conditions like<a>&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/benign-breast-disease">benign breast disease</a>, especially in women under 50.</p>



<p>Your family's cancer history can affect your cancer risk and the chance that a lump might be a more serious concern.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What causes breast lumps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A breast lump can develop as a result of conditions such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Breast cancer</li>



<li>Breast cysts</li>



<li>Fibrocystic breasts</li>



<li>Hamartoma, a noncancerous tumor in the breast</li>



<li>Injury or trauma to the breast&nbsp;</li>



<li>Mastitis</li>
</ul>

<p>In some cases, yes. A mammogram can help your healthcare team determine the cause of the lump and if additional treatment is necessary.&nbsp;They also may recommend additional tests and procedures, such as ultrasound or biopsy.</p>



<p>Early detection and routine mammogram screenings are key to reducing death from breast cancer.&nbsp;That's why Mayo Clinic Health System recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer start screening mammograms yearly at 40.&nbsp;Average risk of breast cancer means women with no family history of breast cancer and no other risk factors for breast cancer. Women with a family history or other risks may need earlier or more frequent mammograms at the guidance of their healthcare team.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When should a breast lump be evaluated?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Any breast symptoms, such as a breast lump, nipple discharge or breast pain, should be evaluated by a medical professional.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schedule an&nbsp;appointment with your healthcare team if you notice:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>A breast lump is new or unusual and feels different from the surrounding tissue or tissue in your other breast.</li>



<li>A breast lump doesn't go away or gets bigger after your next menstrual period.</li>



<li>A breast lump changes and becomes bigger, firmer or more defined from surrounding breast tissue, especially if you have not had it examined by a healthcare professional previously.</li>



<li>Bloody, possibly spontaneous, discharge from your nipple.</li>



<li>Skin changes on your breast, such as redness, crusting, dimpling or puckering.</li>



<li>Your nipple is turned inward (inverted), although it isn't typically positioned that way.</li>
</ul>



<p>Your healthcare team may recommend <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-importance-of-supplemental-screenings-for-dense-breasts/">additional tests</a> and procedures to determine the cause of your breast changes.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a distinctive pattern in a specific set of 17 genes that may be associated with remission after treatment for&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/in-depth/breast-cancer/art-20045654" target="_blank">triple-negative breast cancer</a>. The multi-omics study,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-023-01656-x" target="_blank">published in Breast Cancer Research</a>, highlights the potential for further investigating this signature as a target for individualized medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately 10-15% of breast cancers fall into the category of "triple-negative," indicating that their growth is not driven through the hormone receptors for estrogen or progesterone, nor by the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In contrast, other breast cancers have at least one of these receptors, allowing for treatments that can target or block them to inhibit the cancer's progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Triple-negative breast cancer is known for its resistance to targeted therapies, leaving chemotherapy as the primary treatment option. While most patients initially respond well to the standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, nearly 20% of patients will experience recurrence after treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's crucial that we create tools that assist clinicians in making informed treatment decisions," says&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kalari-krishna-r-ph-d/bio-00095546" target="_blank">Krishna Rani Kalari, Ph.D.</a>, a lead author of the study and an associate professor of biomedical informatics at the Center for Individualized Medicine. "This 17-gene signature is one of the candidate tools that shows potential. However, for this signature to have clinical utility, there will need to be studies evaluating whether alternative drugs/drug combinations may work in this group of patients."&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Decoding pattern in 17 genes</h3>



<p>In their study, the researchers investigated tumor samples before and after treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer who failed to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Using multi-omics analysis and machine learning technologies, they examined changes in gene expression to understand the molecular underpinnings driving tumor recurrence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multi-omics is an emerging multidisciplinary field of biological sciences that encompasses genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and more.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team identified 17 genes associated with relapse-free survival and found that many of the genes may play a role in triggering inflammation to initiate an immune system response. Dr. Kalari says failure to initiate immune response prevents the clearance of weakened tumor cells, thereby permitting the development of treatment resistance and disease re-occurrence.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quest for individualized medicine</h3>



<p>The study is an extension of Mayo Clinic's clinical prospective breast cancer study known as Breast Cancer Genome-Guided Therapy Study (<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/research/clinical-studies/beauty2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BEAUTY</a>). The goal of the study is to determine why some patient’s tumors respond to chemotherapy while others don't, and to use that knowledge as a catalyst to develop personalized medicine therapies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the team plans to further investigate the gene signature and test therapeutic strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-lead authors of the study are Mayo Clinic researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kalari-krishna-r-ph-d/bio-00095546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krishna Rani Kalari, Ph.D.</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/boughey-judy-c-m-d/bio-00027350">Judy Boughey, M.D</a>., and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-00027285">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>&nbsp;Additional authors include Xiaojia Tang, Ph.D. and Kevin Thompson, Ph.D. A comprehensive list of the authors, disclosures, and funding are available in the <a href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-023-01656-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>National Mammography Day will be observed Saturday, Oct. 21, which makes this a good time to learn about the importance of breast cancer screening with mammograms.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breast cancer</a>&nbsp;accounts for 1 in 3 of all new cancers diagnosed in women in the U.S. each year, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. It's estimated that nearly 44,000 women in the U.S. will die from breast cancer this year.</p>



<p>Mammograms play a key role in early breast cancer detection. They can detect breast cancer before it causes signs and symptoms, decreasing breast cancer deaths.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Understanding your risk</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-cancer-risk-assessment/about/pac-20393195?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breast cancer risk assessment</a> takes into account several aspects of your gynecologic health, personal history of breast biopsies, breast density and family history to calculate whether you may be more likely than average to develop breast cancer. You and your healthcare team can use results from a breast cancer risk assessment to determine if you have an increased risk of breast cancer. A breast cancer risk assessment can help you and your healthcare professional decide whether you should consider measures to reduce your risk of breast cancer.</p>



<p>Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of&nbsp;breast cancer. And an estimated 5% to 10% of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancers are linked to gene mutations</a>&nbsp;passed through generations of a family. It's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer while other people with risk factors do not. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.</p>



<p>Some risk factors, such as family history, can't be changed. However, you can make lifestyle changes, including limiting alcohol, eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active, to lower your risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>Mammogram</strong></p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram</a>&nbsp;is an X-ray image of your breasts. It can be used for breast cancer screening and for diagnostic purposes, such as to investigate symptoms or unusual findings on another imaging test.</p>



<p>During a mammogram, your breasts are compressed between two firm surfaces to spread out the breast tissue. Then an X-ray captures black-and-white images that are displayed on a computer screen and examined for signs of cancer.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>3D mammogram</strong></p>



<p>A traditional mammogram creates 2D images of the breast. A newer type of mammogram called a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/3d-mammogram/about/pac-20438708?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3D mammogram</a>, or breast tomosynthesis, creates 3D images of the breast. Many medical facilities offer 3D mammograms in addition to the traditional 2D mammograms for breast cancer screening.</p>



<p>A 3D mammogram is used to look for breast cancer in people who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It also can be used to investigate the cause of breast problems, such as a breast mass, pain and nipple discharge. 3D mammograms also may be recommended for women with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/in-depth/dense-breast-tissue/art-20123968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense breast tissue</a>.</p>



<p>When used for breast cancer screening, the 3D mammogram machine creates 3D images and standard 2D mammogram images because both types of images have some advantages in revealing certain breast abnormalities.</p>

<p><em>Joint development collaboration to bring leading-edge nanopore sequencing into clinical laboratories at Mayo Clinic to increase understanding and improve treatment of cancer and genetic disorders</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn., and OXFORD, UK — Mayo Clinic and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, the company delivering a new generation of nanopore-based molecular sensing technology, today unveiled a multi-year joint development collaboration to develop new clinical tests for diseases and improve patient care.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic and Oxford Nanopore have identified several areas of development, spanning a wide breadth of applications from translational research in human genetics to detection of genetic predisposition to cancer.</p>



<p>“We are proud to work with Mayo Clinic to support the development of new tests that will assist clinical decision-making and improve patient lives. This collaboration shows that Oxford Nanopore’s technology is ready to support development and validation of assays for clinical care, and it underscores our maturity and long-term vision to transform this space. We have long held the ambition to become a utility player in world-renowned, global clinical centers of excellence, and this is our first step toward achieving that vision,” says Gordon Sanghera, CEO, Oxford Nanopore Technologies.</p>



<p>Nanopore sequencing is well positioned to serve Mayo Clinic’s goals of improving testing in some of the hardest-to-characterize conditions. The ability to sequence any-length fragments of DNA — from short to long and ultra-long — and examine methylation in real time offers the potential to provide clinicians with a more complete picture of an evolving cancer genome quickly and accurately. Methylation is particularly important, as this typically requires bisulfite conversions and additional cost yet is key to unmasking crucial insights.</p>



<p>“Pairing Oxford Nanopore’s innovative nanopore sequencing with Mayo Clinic’s world-class clinical and diagnostic testing knowledge further helps advance patient care,” says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/pritt-bobbi-s-m-d/bio-20514068">Bobbi Pritt, M.D.</a>, interim chair of Mayo Clinic’s Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology. “We are excited to collaborate with Oxford Nanopore on this effort to develop new clinical tests that will provide the right answers for patients at the right time.”</p>



<p>The collaboration activities will take place on Mayo Clinic’s campus in Rochester, Minnesota.</p>

<p>It has sparked numerous debates. Is there a connection between soy and breast cancer? Soy contains isoflavones, which are plant estrogens. High estrogen levels have been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. However, <a href="https://www.aicr.org/cancer-prevention/food-facts/soy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> show that soy products don't contain high enough levels of estrogen to increase the chances of developing breast cancer.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mussallem-dawn-m-d-o/bio-20055494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Dawn Mussallem</a>, a lifestyle medicine expert at Mayo Clinic, says consuming soy products in moderation can be beneficial.</p>

<p>Many people enjoy eating soy products like tofu, soy nuts and edamame. Dr. Mussallem says the plant-based protein doesn't increase your chance of developing breast cancer. &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Soy contains plant-based estrogens which don't increase breast cancer risk</h3>



<p>"For years, I've been trying to dispel the myth about soy and breast cancer. And it seems that the message still isn't out because almost every day, every patient I see is worried about consuming soy products," says Dr. Mussallem.</p>



<p>Soy is packed with isoflavones, which is a type of plant estrogen (phytoestrogen) known for its beneficial properties. It has a similar chemical structure to human estrogen, but soy binds to the estrogen receptors on breast tissue differently, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor.</p>



<p>"Soy consumption after a breast cancer diagnosis not only is a great way for you to get a plant-based protein, it also improves your breast cancer outcomes," says Dr. Mussallem.</p>



<p>It is important to avoid ultraprocessed foods, including processed meat, and limit intake of red meat and high-fat dairy. Eating a wide variety of colorful vegetables and fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds can be helpful in preventing and surviving breast cancer.</p>

<p>In August 2021, then-28-year-old Mike Knudson set out on what he thought would be an adventure-filled hiking vacation inside Glacier National Park in Montana. Little did he know at the time that this journey into nature would be the start of an unexpected life path.</p>



<p>It all began innocuously enough just before Mike was scheduled to leave for his trip. One morning before work, he felt a faint tingle course through his body and a peculiar taste fill his mouth as he ate breakfast. The sensations happened again intermittently over the next few weeks and persisted into late August during Mike’s hiking trip. As he trekked more than 20 miles across the mountaintops of Glacier National Park, Mike began to experience symptoms more frequently and severely, which forced him to cut his trip short. When he returned home, he experienced additional symptoms that included chronic fatigue, sensitivity to light, nausea, loss of appetite, and body soreness.</p>



<p>At this point, Mike called in sick from work and went to a local emergency room, where he tested positive for Lyme disease and was given antibiotics. Yet, something still was not right. “I still felt terrible, and I remember telling my friends that if I still felt bad by the upcoming weekend after I finished the antibiotics, I’d go back to the hospital. But I did not make it to the weekend,” Mike says. “That Friday, my legs gave out and I collapsed and passed out in my apartment. My roommates called 911 and got ahold of my family, and I was rushed by ambulance to the nearest ER.” Soon after arriving at a Twin Cities hospital, Mike blacked out. By midnight, he’d regained consciousness and was transferred by helicopter to Mayo Clinic Hospital – Rochester, Saint Marys Campus. “Two thoughts crossed my mind at this point,” Mike says. “‘Whatever I have is very serious,’ and ‘It’s a good thing I’m going to the Mayo Clinic, because if anyone can treat it, it’s them.’”</p>



<p><strong>An unexpected odyssey</strong></p>



<p>When Mike arrived at Saint Marys, Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/parney-ian-f-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ian Parney, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, says testing revealed that his worsening symptoms were being caused by a variant of a grade IV <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioblastoma/cdc-20350148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a> called an isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant astrocytoma. IDH mutant astrocytomas account for approximately 4% of all grade IV primary brain tumors and have a 21- to 30-month survival rate average. “A grade IV IDH mutant astrocytoma is less common than glioblastoma but more common in younger people,”&nbsp;Dr. Parney says.&nbsp;“It’s a malignant brain tumor with a strong tendency to recur in the brain.”</p>



<p>Testing showed that Mike’s tumor had two distinct components. “The first was a very aggressive appearing component that lit up with the contrast dye on his MRI in his left temporal lobe,” Dr. Parney says. “The second was much larger but less aggressive involving his left frontal, temporal and insular lobes.”</p>



<p>Under normal circumstances, clinicians like Dr. Parney would have time to discuss and consider treatment options for brain tumor patients. But given that Mike was “very sick with recurrent seizures and a decreased level of consciousness due to the pressure from the mass inside his head” when he arrived at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Parney knew that wasn’t going to be possible for him.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“HE IS ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF BRAIN TUMOR PATIENTS IN MY CAREER THAT I HAVE TAKEN TO THE OR FOR AN EMERGENCY CRANIOTOMY,” DR. PARNEY SAYS. “WE USUALLY HAVE MORE TIME TO CONSIDER OPTIONS. IN HIS CASE, IT WAS NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE ENHANCING, AGGRESSIVE APPEARING COMPONENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO SAVE HIS LIFE.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Because of the severity of Mike’s symptoms and the swelling in his brain, Dr. Parney made the decision to perform two separate surgeries to remove Mike’s tumor. The first would require Mike to be awake during the procedure so that Dr. Parney and others in the operating suite could mitigate the potential risk that surgery could have on Mike’s motor and speech skills. Mike’s second surgery was even more complex because it carried a risk of significant long-term side effects, such as difficulty speaking or weakness on one side of his body for the rest of his life, paralysis, and even death. Despite these risks, Mike knew he wanted to move forward with the second procedure. To prepare, Dr. Parney worked with colleagues from Mayo Clinic’s Departments of Radiology, Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Neuro-Oncology, Radiation Oncology, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and Speech Pathology to get the best care and treatment plan in place for Mike.</p>



<p>In addition to this inner-specialty collaboration with colleagues across Mayo Clinic, laboratory testing from <a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Laboratories</a> also played a crucial role in establishing Mike’s diagnosis and treatment plan. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/raghunathan-aditya-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20509972" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aditya Raghunathan, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, from Mayo Clinic’s Anatomic Pathology Laboratory, reviewed tissue samples from Mike’s tumor during his surgical procedures, which revealed that while Mike’s tumor showed a resemblance to glioblastoma, it possessed distinct features with a more favorable prognosis. Testing also unveiled a potential susceptibility to targeted agents in case of tumor recurrence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A path to healing</strong></h2>



<p>During Mike’s second surgery, staff from Mayo Clinic’s electroencephalogram lab played a critical role in monitoring his speech and motor skills to ensure they were not impacted by the procedure. “Fortunately, the most pain I went through was honestly just from the tightness of the head wrap bandage,” Mike says. “But over the following months, I had some prolonged symptoms. Most occurred because my tumor was next to my speech center. So, while I still understood all the definitions and knew all the words to an extent, I would forget them mid-sentence.”</p>



<p>Another challenge for Mike was reestablishing his appetite after the four months of rapid onset nausea he’d experienced before coming to Mayo Clinic. “I lost 40 pounds and went from being able to walk perfectly fine to hardly being able to walk more than a few blocks,” he says. “For two months, I used crutches or walking sticks just to walk around the block.”</p>



<p>Today, Mike’s continued healing is marked by his resilience and determination. Following his second surgery, he visited a speech therapist for three months. These efforts yielded remarkable improvements in his speech and communication skills, which underscored his unwavering dedication to regaining his quality of life. He’s also met with Michael Ruff, M.D., chair of Mayo Clinic’s Division of Neuro-Oncology, every two months for comprehensive MRIs and updates on his condition.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“EVERY TIME I HAD AN APPOINTMENT, I'D WRITE UP TWO WHOLE SHEETS OF QUESTIONS TO ASK MY DOCTORS AND THEY WOULD ANSWER EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM,” MIKE SAYS. “I DEEPLY APPRECIATED THE RESPONSES TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to his doctors, Mike has leaned on his friends and family for support throughout his recovery. Both of Mike’s parents are Mayo Clinic employees. His dad, Steve, is chair of Contracting and Payer Relations, while his recently retired mom, Terri, served as senior director of Strategy Management Services for Mayo Clinic’s Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology. “Mike is doing incredible,” Terri Knudson says. “I mean, talk about going past the average. And with his youth and his strength, he’ll beat this thing. A lot has happened in 22 months, but Mike’s still living his life to the fullest. He has a pretty long bucket list, and he’s checking them off quickly.”</p>



<p>Since returning home to the Twin Cities, Mike has embraced his fresh perspective on life by rekindling his love for past hobbies while exploring new interests. Notably, he has devoted time to learning two languages, Spanish and Japanese. He also has reignited his love for archery, making chain mail, blacksmithing, leatherworking, playing piano, reading books, and going for 50-mile bike rides. The longest ride he completed recently stretched for 70 miles, a testament to his determination to surpass his own limits.</p>



<p>True to his adventurous spirit, Mike has also revisited his love for travel. During the summer of 2022, he embarked on thrilling quests to the Rocky Mountains with his friends and a memorable voyage to Australia and New Zealand alongside his parents. During these travels, he fulfilled his lifelong dream to hike one of the world’s Seven Summits, Mount Kosciuszko in Australia, and Mount Doom, New Zealand’s largest active volcano, which served as the iconic backdrop for his favorite film series,&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>. While in New Zealand, Mike and his parents also skydived together over Queenstown, a town that some call the adventure capital of the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Envisioning hope</strong></h2>



<p>With an ever-growing bucket list and the encouraging progress of his health, Mike remains steadfast in his belief that he will continue to defy the odds. Having surpassed the two-year milestone of his diagnosis, both Dr. Parney and Dr. Ruff share Mike’s optimism while recognizing the remarkable trajectory of his journey.</p>



<p>“Mike has done really well,” Dr. Parney says. “He went on to enroll in a clinical trial where he received standard treatment with radiation and chemotherapy as well as an experimental immunotherapy. Coincidentally, I happen to be the principal investigator for this clinical trial. His tumor has shrunk even further on his MRI scans and there has been no sign of recurrence even two years after his diagnosis. We are hopeful but will need to remain vigilant.”</p>



<p>Dr. Ruff echoes Dr. Parney’s optimism.</p>



<p>“Mike is doing what I think we all hope we would do after a serious diagnosis of cancer: living his life to the fullest, traveling, even skydiving,” he says. “He benefited from an exceptional set of surgeries, and a compelling clinical trial using immune therapy in addition to the standard of care. In the near future, he may also benefit from groundbreaking advances in our field targeting the IDH mutation, which his tumor harbors and acts as a molecular driver of the disease. This past June, data was published regarding the successful targeting of this mutation in patients with IDH mutant gliomas with a new form of targeted therapy. While we don’t know that all patients will benefit from the use of these targeted agents or the optimal timing the agents should be employed, we have a now new approach with a proven rationale. It fills you with a sense of hope, and it may benefit other patients like Mike.”</p>



<p>With his health on the mend and his outlook increasingly positive, Mike is looking forward to more progress in his medical journey with Mayo Clinic as well as ongoing research that could bring about improved outcomes for other patients. His story serves as a poignant reminder that life’s most invaluable moments should not be delayed but embraced here and now.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“NO MATTER HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE LEFT, LIVE LIFE TO ITS FULLEST,” HE SAYS. “THAT GOES BEYOND PEOPLE WITH THIS CONDITION. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME DELAYING TRIPS SAYING, ‘I'LL DO THAT IN FIVE YEARS. I'LL DO THAT IN 10 YEARS.’ TAKE THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE LEFT TO GO ENJOY THE LIFE THAT YOU HAVE LEFT WITH ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO TRY. AND LISTEN TO WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ultrasound/about/pac-20395177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrasound</a>&nbsp;— a technology that uses sound waves to produce an image — is commonly used to monitor the development of a baby as it grows inside its mother. But ultrasound imaging also can be used to investigate suspicious masses of tissue and nodules that may be cancerous.</p>



<p>Tumors consist not only of cancer cells but also a matrix of small blood vessels, or microvessels, that cannot be seen in the images produced by conventional ultrasound machines. To solve this problem, physician-scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/alizad-azra-m-d/bio-00085586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azra Alizad, M.D.</a>, and biomedical engineering scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fatemi-mostafa-ph-d/bio-00086282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostafa Fatemi, Ph.D.</a>, teamed up at Mayo Clinic to design and study a tool that may improve the resolution of ultrasound imaging. As demonstrated in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, they developed high-resolution ultrasound imaging software, compatible with many ultrasound machines, that could exponentially improve both the detail and quality of images.</p>



<p>The investigational software, which they've named quantitative high-definition microvessel imaging (q-HDMI), has been evaluated to capture high-resolution 2D and 3D images of microvessels as small as 150 microns, roughly twice the width of a human hair.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 35%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>"If we can visualize and capture the microvessel in the earliest stages of cancer, we can better diagnose and treat it earlier, which improves the outcome for the patient," says Dr. Alizad, who specializes in ultrasound technology for cancer imaging.</p>
</div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="925" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-375671 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1.jpg 925w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1-271x300.jpg 271w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Alizad-WF3352118_0032-cut-925x1024-1-768x850.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" /></figure></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artificial intelligence helps detect what we cannot see</strong></h2>



<p>In addition, the researchers identified a series of biomarkers representing specific characteristics of tiny </p>



<p>vessels, such as shape, pattern, irregularity and complexity, and packaged them into an algorithm that can sort the image data into benign or malignant masses.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:37% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="481" height="532" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-375670 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical.jpg 481w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Dr.-Fatemi-WF3352118_0019_vertical-271x300.jpg 271w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p></p>



<p>"This technology provides a quantitative value that shows the probability of malignancy," Dr. Fatemi says. "It's a tool to extract information in a way that can be useful to clinicians."</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applying it in practice</strong></h2>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-022-01583-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical study</a>, the researchers showed that their new q-HDMI tool combined with artificial intelligence (AI) was able to detect a very small, 3-millimeter-wide, malignant breast cancer mass comprised of miniscule vessels in a 40-year-old woman. Finding and treating cancer lesions when they are this size before they spread, or metastasize, can be lifesaving.</p>



<p>"The questions in radiology really are: benign or malignant? And if it's suspicious, how concerned should we be?" Dr. Fatemi says.</p>



<p>To help radiologists answer these questions, the researchers applied their software and algorithm to further analyze suspicious breast masses from 521 patients who already had received conventional ultrasound imaging. The results were astounding. The new technology yielded a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35486168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 100% rate of accuracy</a>&nbsp;in determining malignant versus benign masses, regardless of the tumor size.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="fluidEmbed"><iframe loading="lazy" id="videoidqCtLfFbWcEoampt"  title="3D images of benign and malignant breast tissue masses" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCtLfFbWcEo?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>More recently, the researchers analyzed thyroid nodules from 92 patients. Thyroid nodules are common and it is often hard to differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous ones through imaging. Yet the prevalence of thyroid cancer has increased over the last few decades.</p>



<p>"With conventional ultrasound images, physicians can diagnose whether a thyroid nodule is benign or malignant with only about 35-75% accuracy," Dr. Alizad says. That's why physicians often opt to perform thyroid biopsies, which enable them to more definitively determine if a thyroid nodule is a cause for concern.</p>



<p>The researchers identified 12 biomarkers that can differentiate benign from malignant thyroid tissues. They programmed the AI-powered algorithm with these biomarkers, which sorted the images and had an 84% rate of accuracy. These results were published in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36980774/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancers</a>&nbsp;and highlighted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/news-events/newsroom/how-combination-advanced-ultrasound-and-ai-could-upgrade-cancer-diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>.</p>



<p>"If it is cancer, we definitely want to know that. But if we can determine if a thyroid nodule is benign without even having to do a biopsy, that is even better as it spares the patient from the financial and physical burdens associated with an unnecessary benign biopsy," Dr. Alizad says.</p>



<p>The researchers see that their quantitative tool could be particularly useful in parts of the world where there is limited expertise and resources, such as rural areas and developing countries.</p>



<p>They also are collaborating with oncologists to enable them to use the q-HDMI tool to better monitor the effectiveness of cancer treatments and help them adjust therapies for individual patients in real time.</p>

<p>October is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aacr.org/patients-caregivers/awareness-months/liver-cancer-awareness-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liver Cancer Awareness Month</a>, which makes this<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>a good time to learn more about risk factors for liver cancer and what you can do to prevent it.</p>



<p>More than 41,000 new cases of primary liver cancer and intrahepatic bile duct cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year, and nearly 30,000 people will die of these diseases, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/liver-cancer/about/what-is-key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liver cancer</a>&nbsp;is cancer that begins in the cells of your liver, which is a football-sized organ in the upper right portion of your abdomen. The liver is essential for digesting food and ridding your body of toxic substances.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intrahepatic bile duct cancer</a>, which sometimes is classified as a type of liver cancer, occurs in the parts of the bile ducts within the liver. Bile ducts carry bile, a digestive fluid, and they connect your liver to your gallbladder and small intestine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2>



<p>Factors that increase the risk of primary liver cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chronic infection with HBV or HCV.</strong><br>Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) increases your risk of liver cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Cirrhosis.</strong><br>This progressive and irreversible condition causes scar tissue to form in your liver and increases your chances of developing liver cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Certain inherited liver diseases.</strong><br>Liver diseases that can increase the risk of liver cancer include hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease.</li>



<li><strong>Diabetes.</strong><br>People with this blood sugar disorder have a greater risk of liver cancer than those who don't have diabetes.</li>



<li><strong>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</strong><br>An accumulation of fat in the liver increases the risk of liver cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Exposure to aflatoxins.</strong><br>Aflatoxins are poisons produced by molds that grow on crops that are stored poorly. Grains and nuts can become contaminated with aflatoxins and end up in foods made of these products.</li>



<li><strong>Excessive alcohol consumption.</strong><br>Consuming more than a moderate amount of alcohol daily over many years can lead to irreversible liver damage and increase your risk of liver cancer.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>



<p>Strategies for preventing liver cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce your risk of cirrhosis.</strong><br>Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver, and it increases the risk of liver cancer. You can reduce your risk of cirrhosis if you drink alcohol in moderation, if at all, and maintain a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Get vaccinated against hepatitis B.</strong><br>You can reduce your risk of hepatitis B by receiving the hepatitis B vaccine. The vaccine can be given to almost anyone, including infants, older adults and those with compromised immune systems.</li>



<li><strong>Take measures to prevent hepatitis C.</strong><br>No vaccine for hepatitis C exists, but you can reduce your risk of infection by taking care to avoid unprotected sex with a partner infected with&nbsp;HBV,&nbsp;HCV&nbsp;or any other sexually transmitted infection. Don't inject illegal drugs. If you do, make sure any needle you use is sterile and don't share it. And  before getting a piercing or tattoo, check out the shops in your area and ask staff members about their safety practices. Needles that are not properly sterilized can spread the hepatitis C virus.</li>



<li><strong>Seek treatment for hepatitis B or hepatitis C.</strong><br>Treatments are available for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections. Research shows that treatment can reduce the risk of liver cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Ask your healthcare professional about liver cancer screening.</strong><br>For the general population, screening for liver cancer hasn't been proved to reduce the risk of dying of liver cancer, and it isn't generally recommended. People with conditions that increase the risk of liver cancer, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and liver cirrhosis, might consider screening. Discuss the pros and cons of screening with your healthcare team. Together you can decide whether screening is right for you based on your risk. Screening typically involves a blood test and an abdominal ultrasound exam every six months.</li>
