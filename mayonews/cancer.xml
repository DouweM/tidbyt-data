<p>When Walter "Dick" Whetstone leaves his home in central South Carolina, he's usually wearing a paw print or, at the least, his school colors of orange and purple. The proud Clemson University alumnus didn't realize that what he wore to an appointment would earn him a nickname and a chance to help others.</p>



<p>In late 2020, Dick began losing weight. At first, it was on purpose, as he was making diet and exercise adjustments to keep up with his grandchildren. But when the changes stopped, and his weight continued to drop, he went to his family doctor for answers.</p>



<p>Tests confirmed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic cancer</a>, and by July 2021, Dick was receiving chemotherapy in South Carolina. Doctors estimated he had four to six months to live.</p>



<p>"I remember asking my wife for a piece of paper so I could write down who would be pallbearers at my funeral," Dick says.</p>



<p>Complications from an open-heart surgery several years earlier led him to experience cardiac arrest four times during treatment. He explained that surgery to remove a tumor was called off in the operating room and that the physician recommended palliative care.</p>



<p>"If I'm going down, I'm going down fighting," Dick says.</p>



<p>That's when he began researching options for pancreatic cancer treatment. He found information about Mayo Clinic and called the operator.</p>



<p>"Within 10 days of me calling the number, I had connected with the care team at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> and was in Jacksonville for tests and appointments," Dick says. "Within the month, I was preparing for surgery."</p>



<p>He packed a Clemson polo for luck and to show his school spirit. The paw print became a conversation piece when Dick met <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/stauffer-john-a-m-d/bio-20055448?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. John Stauffer</a> for his preoperative appointment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385834" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture2.jpg 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Dick received an autographed football from his alma mater in 2021 while undergoing chemotherapy.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"Dr. Stauffer walked in the room, saw my shirt and asked, 'Are you one of those Tigers?'" Dick recalls. "We talked about how he was an Ohio State graduate, and before I left, he nicknamed me 'Tiger.'"</p>



<p>Schedulers found an earlier surgery option for Dick so he didn't have to commute home and back to Florida. When he was brought into the operating room, the words he exchanged with Dr. Stauffer are ones he'll remember for the rest of his life.</p>



<p>"He came up to me and said, 'Tiger, we're all on the same side today. I'll see you on the other side,'" Dick says.</p>



<p>The procedure was successful. In addition to removing cancerous tissue, his care team, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/may-byron-c-m-d/bio-20138357?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Byron May</a>, delivered intraoperative radiation therapy using a mobile linear accelerator. Dr. May explains that radiation was the best approach because several critical arteries and veins supplying the liver, stomach and intestines cannot be removed, but are often affected by pancreatic cancer.</p>



<p>"Dr. Stauffer and I confer on each patient, determining the precise target zone to be safely irradiated, and follow that plan once the surgical team has removed as much of the cancerous tissue as possible," Dr. May says. "This teamwork and collaboration before, during and after surgery assures maximal success for our patient."</p>



<p>Motivated to get back to his family, Dick started walking with his nurses around the halls. For a patient Dick's age, hospital stays after surgery range from 15 to 18 days. Dick exceeded expectations and was cleared by his team after five days.</p>



<p>In the time since his procedure at Mayo Clinic, Dick has worked toward renewing his pilot's license — once a dream he thought was gone due to his health. He spends more time with his family, including his grandchildren; working outside; and he's shared his journey with dozens of people in his community who have been diagnosed with cancer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture3-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385833" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Picture3.jpg 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Dick Whetstone planting azaleas near his South Carolina home in March 2024.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"Looking back, I could have given up a hundred times," Dick says. "When I started speaking with patients, I tell them, 'It's going to be rough, and you're going to want to quit — don't. Stay hopeful and determined.' That's been my message to 50 people over the last three years."</p>



<p>He often thinks about his conversation with Dr. Stauffer just before his procedure about being on the same team.</p>



<p>"It's an incredible feeling to know a group of people, who are focused on helping you and making you well again, and who say, 'We're all on the same team,' Dick says. "It's an amazing place to be."</p>

<p>April is <a href="https://www.aacr.org/patients-caregivers/awareness-months/head-and-neck-cancer-awareness-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Head and Neck Cancer Awareness Month</a>, which makes this a good time to learn about four types of cancer that affect these areas of the body.</p>



<p>Head and neck cancers account for nearly 4% of all cancers in the U.S., according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/head-and-neck/head-neck-fact-sheet#how-common-are-head-and-neck-cancers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a>. These cancers are more than twice as common among men as women, and are diagnosed more often among people over 50.</p>



<p>Among the many types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/symptoms-causes/syc-20354171?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head and neck cancers</a> are these four:</p>



<p><strong>Esthesioneuroblastoma</strong></p>



<p>This is a rare type of cancer that begins in the upper portion of the nasal cavity. The area where <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/esthesioneuroblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351075?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esthesioneuroblastoma</a> begins is separated from the brain by a bone that contains tiny holes that allow the nerves that control the sense of smell to pass through. Esthesioneuroblastoma also is called olfactory neuroblastoma.<br><br>Signs and symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma include loss of sense of smell, frequent nosebleeds and difficulty breathing through the nostrils as the tumor grows.</p>



<p><strong>Lip cancer</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lip-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355079?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lip cancer</a> can occur anywhere along the upper or lower lip, but it's most common on the lower lip. Risk factors include excessive sun exposure and tobacco use, particularly pipe smoking. You can reduce your risk of lip cancer by protecting your face from the sun with a hat or sunblock, and by quitting smoking.<br><br>Signs and symptoms of lip cancer include a flat or slightly raised whitish discoloration of the lip; a sore on the lip that won’t heal; and tingling, pain or numbness of the lips or the skin around the mouth.</p>



<p><strong>Nasal and paranasal tumors</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nasal-paranasal-tumors/symptoms-causes/syc-20354136?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nasal and paranasal tumors</a> are abnormal growths that begin in and around the passageway within your nose. Risk factors include smoking and being around people who are smoking, air pollution and long-term exposure to chemicals and irritants, and HPV infection.<br><br>Signs and symptoms of nasal and paranasal tumors include difficulty breathing through the nose, loss of sense of smell, nosebleeds, and facial swelling or pain.</p>



<p><strong>Throat cancer</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Throat cancer</a> can develop in the throat or voice box. Risk factors include tobacco use; excessive alcohol use; and viral infections, including HPV and Epstein-Barr virus.<br><br>Signs and symptoms of throat cancer include a cough; changes in the voice, such as hoarseness or not speaking clearly; difficulty swallowing; and ear or throat pain.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers used a new approach to chemotherapy to more than double the typical survival rate for patients with stomach cancer and peritoneal metastasis, which is cancer that has spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity, according to a study published in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1245/s10434-023-14379-2?sharing_token=izzkP9mkEzSjWxeG7Xa9dFR9MmLxJfDmU1c3CqwK5f3wLUJQhSLmLagY2QEynd9jmkArmVywnDHLt0EcA8r2PM76wCtckV8vTgboUgXYD6HGWsZqNVRJ5kCkxmtcHBsF3rDL2hyp5moyFyBa8G0_AfEIc_Zkj6srGmyuHe95P4g=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annals of Surgical Oncology.</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stomach-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stomach cancer</a>, which is also called gastric cancer, is caused by an uncontrolled growth of cells that starts in the stomach. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease has spread beyond the stomach and a cure is less likely.</p>



<p>"We're seeing an increase in stomach cancer in younger people, and it tends to be more advanced," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grotz-travis-e-m-d/bio-20342285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Grotz, M.D.</a>, surgical oncologist. “Unfortunately, when stomach cancer spreads to the peritoneum, systemic therapy is the primary treatment, resulting in only one year to live on average. Our research team was determined to improve outcomes for these patients so they can have more time with their family and friends."</p>

<p>In the study, the patients received cytoreductive surgery to remove all visible cancer tumors in the stomach and abdominal cavity, followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). During HIPEC, the abdominal cavity is bathed with hot chemotherapy drugs, in this case cisplatin and paclitaxel, for 90 minutes to kill any remaining microscopic cancer cells. Heating the chemotherapy drugs and administering them directly into the abdominal cavity allows for both a higher dosage and greater penetration of the chemotherapy, resulting in more cancer cells being destroyed than conventional treatment, say the researchers.</p>



<p>"The median survival for most stage 4 gastric cancer patients is around 13 months," says Dr. Grotz, who is lead author of the study. "By using this new combination of chemotherapy drugs during hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, more than half (55%) of our patients are still alive three years after surgery."</p>

<p>The patients studied were ages 46-62 with stage 4 gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis. They received an average of seven cycles of chemotherapy prior to undergoing cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. After the procedure, the patients stayed in the hospital for around six days, with most patients having no complications. Of the patients who had complications, most were lower grade and didn't prolong their hospital stay.</p>



<p>Researchers followed the patients clinically with imaging and tumor markers every three to four months for the first two years and every six months thereafter. The one, two and three-year overall survival rates were 96%, 78% and 55%, respectively.</p>



<p>The research team is looking to improve those outcomes even further by performing similar procedures robotically to require smaller abdominal incisions. The goal is to decrease the length of hospital stays and complication rates and quicken recovery so patients can get back to enjoying their lives. Eventually, Dr. Grotz hopes to do the procedure even sooner after diagnosis to prevent the spread of stomach cancer to the peritoneum.</p>



<p>"People with gastric cancer are usually told they have no hope and no options. When I was a medical student, I was motivated to wholly understand the cancer, how to treat it to really make a meaningful impact and cure some of these patients or prolong their survival or help alleviate their symptoms," says Dr. Grotz. "Although we still have a long way to go, we've made some big strides and will continue to make progress to provide hope and healing for our patients."</p>

<p>Most kidney cancer is discovered at an early stage when the cancer is small and confined to the kidney.</p>



<p>"Many patients are diagnosed coincidentally by imaging of the abdomen with a small renal mass, and they have a lot of options," says Dr. Potretzke.</p>



<p>The surgical approach to kidney cancer has shifted over the years to preserving as much of the healthy kidney as possible. Mayo Clinic has adopted some of the most advanced techniques, such as use of robotics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Dr.-Aaron-Potretzke-robotic-surgery-Davinci-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Dr. Aaron Potretzke performing robotic-assisted surgery, kidney cancer treatment

<p>"There is a focus, when it's safe and feasible, to removing just the tumor and leaving as much of the normal kidney behind as possible. Doing so is associated with increased long-term kidney function," says Dr. Potretzke.</p>



<p>Another option is to perform an ablation.</p>



<p>"They (radiologists) can stick a series of needles into the tumor and freeze it, or microwave it to death, and destroy the tumor while maintaining the normal, healthy kidney. And there is a fair bit of evidence that, in the correct patient, each one of those strategies can be really successful," says Dr. Potretzke.</p>



<p>Because many kidney tumors found early are relatively low risk, a third option is to keep a close eye on it, which is called active surveillance.</p>



<p>"Not everyone is a suitable candidate, but for patients with smaller renal masses, the risks of treatment may actually outweigh the potential benefits," adds Dr. Potretzke.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new multicenter, international study suggests that people who have early-stage <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/03/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer-and-its-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triple-negative breast cancer</a> (TNBC) and high levels of immune cells within their tumors may have a lower risk of recurrence and better survival rates even when not treated with chemotherapy. The <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816923">study</a> was published today in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA).</p>



<p>TNBC is a breast cancer subtype that does not respond to drugs that target the estrogen receptor or the HER2 protein. It grows rapidly, is more likely to spread beyond the breast before diagnosis and is more likely to recur than other breast cancers. TNBC represents about 15% of all breast cancers and is more common in younger people and in women of African American, Hispanic and Indian descent. Immune cells, also known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, are naturally existing immune system cells that can move from the bloodstream into a&nbsp;tumor and&nbsp;can recognize and destroy cancer cells.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Slide2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-384966" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Slide2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Slide2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Slide2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Slide2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>This is a tumor from a patient where the immune cells, also known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TILs, (blue arrow) are attacking the cancer (yellow arrow). The study shows that patients with these findings had a good outcome, even when chemotherapy was not administered</strong>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"This is an important finding because it highlights that the abundance of TILs in breast tissue is a prognostic biomarker in people with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, even when chemotherapy is not administered," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20463845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> and first author of the study. "The study's findings may inspire future clinical trials to explore whether patients with a favorable prognosis (high TILs) can avoid intensive chemotherapy regimens."</p>



<p>"This meta-analysis confirms robustly the prognostic value of TILs that we have previously reported in TNBC patients treated with chemotherapy and expands it to patients treated without chemotherapy," says Sarah Flora Jonas, Ph.D., a statistician at <a href="https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en/oncostat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gustave Roussy</a> and co-first author of the study. "Future studies may allow the use of this biomarker along with standard clinicopathological factors to inform treatment decisions in TNBC patients."</p>



<p>"Of interest, the first report suggesting that an increased number of immune cells being associated with better prognosis in breast cancer patients was described by doctors at Mayo Clinic more than 100 years ago," says Roberto Salgado, M.D., co-chair of the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group; co-lead of the study; and pathologist from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia, and ZAS Hospitals, Antwerp, Belgium. "It took a global effort and a century later to reexamine this biomarker and bring it closer to application in patient care."</p>

<p>"TILs are not currently measured or reported in the routine examination of tissue samples of breast cancer," says co-senior author, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-00027285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>, a medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Erivan K. Haub Family Professor of Cancer Research Honoring Richard F. Emslander, M.D. "While prior studies have focused on measuring TILs in people treated with chemotherapy, this is the largest study to comprehensively demonstrate that the presence of TILs influences the natural behavior of breast cancer in people who have surgery and/or radiation with no additional medical treatment."</p>



<p>For this study, Mayo Clinic and Gustave Roussy researchers, in collaboration with the International Immuno-Oncology Biomarker Working Group, led 11 additional groups to collect data on 1,966 participants with early-stage TNBC who only underwent surgery with or without radiation therapy but did not receive chemotherapy. The participants had been followed for a median of 18 years. The results showed that higher levels of TILs in breast cancer tissue were associated with lower recurrence rates among participants with early-stage TNBC.</p>



<p>"Five years after surgery, 95% of participants with small tumors, stage 1 TNBC, and whose tumors had high TILs were alive, compared to 82% of patients whose tumors had low TILs. Importantly, the breast cancer recurrence rate was significantly lower among patients whose tumors had high TILs," says co-senior author, <a href="https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en/oncostat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stefan Michiels, Ph.D.</a>, head of Oncostat team, Gustave Roussy, Inserm U1018, University Paris-Saclay. "With nearly 2,000 participants involved in the study, we have now assembled the largest international cohort across three continents of people with TNBC in which the primary treatment was surgery without chemotherapy."</p>



<p>"The results of this study could lead to a recommendation to include TILs in the pathology reports of early-stage TNBC worldwide, as it has the potential to inform clinicians and patients when they discuss treatment options," says Dr. Salgado.</p>



<p>Furthermore, this biomarker would only require a visual evaluation by a pathologist looking through a microscope, meaning there are no additional costs associated with identifying the presence of immune cells. This could be particularly beneficial to regions with limited resources, adds Dr. Leon-Ferre.</p>



<p>Most people with early-stage TNBC undergo chemotherapy either before or after surgery, including people with stage 1 breast cancer. Most people receive multiple chemotherapy drugs in combination, which can cause significant side effects. Currently, the main factors taken into consideration to determine the course of chemotherapy treatment for each person are the tumor size and the presence of lymph node metastases. However, the authors identified that the number of TILs further influences the risk of future recurrence.</p>



<p>The researchers plan to evaluate TILs as biomarkers in prospective clinical trials evaluating chemotherapy selection based on TIL levels. Ongoing efforts to conduct additional research with other potential biomarkers are underway.</p>

<p>Sylvester Pinckney is someone who knows a lot about teamwork. He was a star football player in high school and college; he and his wife, Sabrina, have raised a family together; and for more than 20 years, he has worked to promote the well-being of children throughout his community.</p>



<p>When Sylvester was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352638">follicular lymphoma</a> in 2016, he knew he would have a team supporting him.</p>



<p>"When you have the opportunity to continue to live and fight for your family and your children, you have got to do it," Sylvester says.</p>



<p>He went to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, just a few miles from his home. Sylvester's care team treated the lymphoma with an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/autologous-stem-cell-transplant/pyc-20384859">autologous stem cell transplant</a>, and his cancer went into remission for nearly seven years.</p>



<p>But in 2023, he began to feel fatigued and pain, which prompted him to visit his community physician. Tests determined that his lymphoma had recurred.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g3YKh8xZro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: CAR-T cell therapy helps man continue community advocacy</a></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="fluidEmbed"><iframe loading="lazy" id="videoid4g3YKh8xZro"  title="CAR-T cell therapy helps man continue community advocacy" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4g3YKh8xZro?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>"When Mr. Pinckney was evaluated, we worked very closely with his community oncologist in Jacksonville," <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kharfan-dabaja-mohamed-a-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20425931">Dr. Mohamed Kharfan-Dabaja</a> says. "He was found to be a good candidate for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy</a> (CAR-T cell therapy), and we all agreed that this was the best course of action."</p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy collects a patient's T cells, which normally help fight off infections, and genetically engineers them to identify and target cancer cells. Those cells are then infused back into the body.</p>



<p>"Cancer is a huge word," Sabrina says. "Thirty or 40 years ago, that was a death sentence word. But look where we've come from just (seven) years ago. CAR-T cell therapy was in its prototype stages, but who knew we'd walk this walk again and the prototype would address the very cancer that my husband has? That's a blessing within itself."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-384615" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Sylvester-Pinckney_scan.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Sylvester Pinckney prepares for an imaging test.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As he prepared for his infusion, Sylvester was comforted knowing his experience could help others understand and have confidence in the treatment.</p>



<p>"You're the person going through it, but you have others who can benefit from it," Sylvester says. "Through your journey, be able to have a voice and tell them it will be fine; trust the process and the science. And when you're a patient going through something like that, it is very important to have that family environment and family feel."</p>



<p>In the days, weeks and months after CAR-T cell therapy, Sylvester was monitored closely. He began to feel his strength and energy return. At 100 days posttreatment, his care team delivered the news: his cancer was in remission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I believe in the bells that ring here every day," Sabrina says. "I believe in the doctors just walking the halls every day. The nurses down to the beautification staff, everyone I've ever come in contact with here, it is more than a job — it's a passion."</p>



<p>Sylvester shares that sentiment. His passion to positively affect the community and ensure the well-being of young people continues. Sylvester adds that the collaboration among healthcare professionals at Mayo Clinic and the Jacksonville community gives him hope for the future and gratitude for the present.</p>



<p>"Having a treatment that can change lives in your hometown is powerful," Sylvester says. "For me to be able to go home and come back is a blessing. I thank God that CAR-T was an option for me. I'm very grateful, and we have a family that has been blessed."</p>

<p>Tobacco and alcohol use increase the risk of non-HPV tumors, while HPV is responsible for about 70% of head and neck cancers.</p>



<p>"What's important about that is they are different biology and they're much more treatable, meaning they respond better to treatments, and they tend to have a higher cure rate. We're sort of treating those differently than how we treat some of the non-HPV cancers," says Dr. Price.</p>



<p>Surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20558359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a>&nbsp;options, but Dr. Price says it is better to reduce the risks of infection.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ways to help prevent head and neck cancer</strong></h2>



<p>"The big three: no smoking tobacco use, minimizing alcohol and then HPV vaccination," she explains.<br><br>"We know that smoking and alcohol are big risk factors for head and neck cancer if you do both. This increases your risk even more," says Dr. Price.</p>



<p>And she encourages eating a healthy diet.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hasadsri-linda-m-d-ph-d/bio-20514421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linda Hasadsri, M.D., Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;(they/them/she/her), began a Mayo Clinic fellowship in Clinical Molecular Genetics immediately after completing their training in Clinical Biochemical Genetics, they never imagined the genetic tests they were helping develop would be the very same tests that guided their life’s journey. But just after starting that fellowship, Dr. Hasadsri’s personal and professional worlds collided, giving them a dual role as both patient and physician.</p>



<p>Now the director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview/specialty-groups/laboratory-genetics/molecular-genetics-laboratory">Molecular Technologies Laboratory</a> in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology and proud mom to two sons, Dr. Hasadsri’s experiences provide a unique perspective on the quality of Mayo Clinic Laboratories testing, the importance of timing, and the implications of test results for the future.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“WHEN I SAY A GENETIC TEST IS THE BEST TEST OUT THERE YOU COULD GET FROM THE BEST PEOPLE, I KNOW IT FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE — I’M NOT JUST HYPING IT UP BASED ON SOME PERFORMANCE METRICS,” DR. HASADSRI SAYS. “I ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND COULD TELL YOU ALL THE THINGS A TEST DOES WELL AND WHAT INFORMATION IT CAN YIELD FOR YOU.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Back in 2012, Dr. Hasadsri was working through an intense laboratory fellowship. Newly married and pregnant, their life took an unexpected turn when they miscarried the pregnancy. The devastating event triggered a sequence of medical discoveries that saved Dr. Hasadsri’s life and placed them on a genetic testing track that enabled the family of their dreams.</p>



<p>“If that pregnancy and pregnancy loss had not happened, I would not have gotten my cancer diagnosis, I would not have been stage 3 — I would’ve been stage 4. Literally, that baby that never was saved my life.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Up close and personal with genetic testing</strong></h2>



<p>Despite their young age and having no known family history of cancer, Dr. Hasadsri was found to have stage 3 colorectal cancer.&nbsp; A sample of the tumor tissue underwent somatic testing (current&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/overview/616489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo ID: MCCRC</a>). Much to Dr. Hasadsri’s surprise, the results came back suggestive of Lynch syndrome, a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome, and a blood sample was submitted for follow-up hereditary testing (current&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/Overview/614572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo ID: LYNCP</a>). Advanced sequencing to detect gene variants related to Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of colon, endometrial, uterine, and other cancers, yielded no pathogenic variants.</p>



<p>The negative test result was the first of many Dr. Hasadsri has received in the past decade. Each result informing their choices and providing reassurance that nothing has been missed. Moreover, the ability to experience each existing and newly implemented oncology test in the lab has provided unique insight into what answers mean to patients.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“IT WAS AN UNREAL EXPERIENCE TO BE TRAINED ON THE TESTS THAT I MYSELF WAS EXPERIENCING — IT REALLY LEVELS UP YOUR LEARNING,” DR. HASADSRI SAYS. “WITH EACH NEW TEST OR TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS LAUNCHED, I WOULD HAVE IT BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO SEE WHETHER I HAVE A MOLECULAR EXPLANATION FOR THIS CANCER, EITHER HEREDITARY OR ACQUIRED, BECAUSE EITHER WAY I WOULD HAVE AN ANSWER THAT COULD HELP ME PREPARE OR PLAN MY LIFE ACCORDINGLY.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Navigating health challenges</strong></h2>



<p>For Dr. Hasadsri, the miscarriage marked the beginning of an ongoing testing journey. Just after the loss, blood testing revealed a hemoglobin level of five grams per deciliter (g/dL) of blood. The average hemoglobin in adult females is 12–15 g/dL.</p>



<p>“(My primary care physicians) were like, ‘This is not conducive to a successful pregnancy, and we need to get to the bottom of this,’” explains Dr. Hasadsri.</p>



<p>Due to a known family history of alpha-thalassemia, Dr. Hasadsri was sent to hematology to determine whether an underlying anemia was at play. While suspected hematologic culprits were being discussed, the hematology-oncology fellow performing the physical exam found an abdominal mass.</p>



<p>“The whole time I was feeling exhausted from what turned out to be anemia and having some abdominal pain after eating meals, I'd never even thought to examine myself,” Dr. Hasadsri says. “And then once I actually felt that area of my abdomen, I could definitely palpate it as well. I could push around it and feel my lymph nodes were enlarged too. And so that got me worried.<em>”</em></p>



<p>Although cancer was within the differential diagnosis, it was not something Dr. Hasadsri easily accepted. “I’m like, ‘maybe I just have really bad inflammatory bowel disease and my colon is just really angry and hardened from that.’”</p>



<p>CT imaging revealed the mass had penetrated two sections of the colon, causing internal bleeding and a low hemoglobin level. Neighboring lymph nodes were also enlarged. During a follow-up colonoscopy, part of the mass was removed and biopsied. Somatic tumor testing revealed features of Lynch syndrome, an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, but germline testing did not identify any causative genetic variants.</p>



<p>Female colon cancer patients who test positive for Lynch syndrome are at an increased risk of developing uterine, endometrial, endothelial, and gastric cancers, among others.</p>



<p>“If an individual with Lynch syndrome is diagnosed with colon cancer and has a uterus in place, we typically remove the uterus (hysterectomy), fallopian tubes, and ovaries at the time of colon cancer surgery, unless the individual has not completed childbearing,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wick-myra-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20054521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Myra Wick, M.D. Ph.D.</a>, Dr. Hasadsri’s OB/GYN and medical geneticist. “This reduces cancer risk and the need for additional surgeries in the future.”</p>



<p>The pending nature of Dr. Hasadsri ’s molecular test result at the time they were scheduled to undergo a hemicolectomy, combined with their knowledge that Lynch syndrome diagnosis can only be cemented through molecular genetic testing, empowered them to push back against the recommended surgical approach.</p>



<p>“I remember during the consent process before going into surgery, they were saying, ‘You have Lynch syndrome — we should remove your uterus and ovaries too,’’’ Dr. Hasadsri says. “And I was like ‘WAIT! I still want those, I’m not done with those yet.’”</p>



<p>So the uterus and ovaries stayed. But 75% of Dr. Hasadsri’s colon and more than 30 lymph nodes were removed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Defying the odds to build a family</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="226" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Right_After_Surgery-300x226.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385024" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Right_After_Surgery-300x226.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Right_After_Surgery.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Hasadsri rests in bed just after surgery to remove colon cancer.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>After the surgery, Dr. Hasadsri and their spouse, Vincent Pureza, M.D., Ph.D., faced another decision. Because the chemotherapy needed to target any lingering cancer cells would push Dr. Hasadsri into premature menopause and limit their ability to bear genetic offspring, did they want to undergo&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;fertilization and preserve embryos so they could one day try for the family they still hoped for?</p>



<p>In the end, the answer was yes. Thanks to a grant from the Livestrong Foundation, the couple successfully created and froze five embryos.</p>



<p>Immediately after the egg retrieval, Dr. Hasadsri began chemotherapy. Over the course of six months — all while still training as a Mayo Clinic fellow — they received 12 rounds of treatment.</p>



<p>“I was told that after chemo, you should probably wait at least a year before trying to get pregnant, because all of those harmful chemicals are still in your body. We don't know what effect they're going to have on the eggs, on a potential embryo, or pregnancy,” Dr. Hasadsri says. “And chemo definitely put me in menopause. But just to be safe I also went on birth control afterwards too, because I was like, I’m not going to take any chances.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Last_Round_of_Chemotherapy-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-385025" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Last_Round_of_Chemotherapy-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Last_Round_of_Chemotherapy.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Hasadsri celebrates their final round of chemotherapy at Mayo Clinic.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But just one month after chemotherapy ended, the unimaginable happened: Dr. Hasadsri conceived naturally.</p>



<p>“My OB/GYN, who is also a medical geneticist, was happy but also a little freaked out. It was too soon,” Dr. Hasadsri says.</p>



<p>“It is always concerning when women become pregnant in the midst of cancer treatment,” Dr. Wick says. “We're not always sure if there will be implications for the pregnancy,” Dr. Wick says. “We don’t know if some of the treatment the patient is on currently or previously might affect fetal growth or be associated with congenital problems. So, Dr. Hasadsri’s pregnancy soon after chemotherapy placed them into a high-risk pregnancy category, where we monitor things more carefully, including the baby's growth.”</p>



<p>The pregnancy, however, was successful, and so was the delivery.</p>



<p>“And that's how my 7-year-old came into being,” Dr. Hasadsri says.</p>



<p>Three years later, after using the frozen embryos and enduring three pregnancy losses, Dr. Hasadsri had accepted their fate.</p>



<p>“It was like, OK, I guess one child’s enough, I’m perfectly happy to have this one miracle baby that I didn’t even think I would have,” they say. “But then I got naturally pregnant with my second at age 40. I feel very lucky.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Proactively managing diagnosis</strong></h2>



<p>Throughout their medical journey, Dr. Hasadsri has followed the screening and testing recommendations for individuals with Lynch syndrome, despite lacking a genetic diagnosis.</p>



<p>“Even though I still carry a Lynch syndrome diagnosis in my chart, it’s because they would rather err on the conservative side and make sure I am managed appropriately, which I am totally on board with,” Dr. Hasadsri says. “I’d rather be screened more often than less since, even if I were eventually found not to have Lynch, I still worry about my risk of a cancer recurrence.”</p>



<p>That translates into annual colonoscopies. Before having their second son, Dr. Hasadsri also received annual endometrial biopsies. Not long after the baby was born, Dr. Hasadsri underwent a hysterectomy and oophorectomy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I’M GETTING TO NOT JUST WITNESS THE PROGRESS BEING MADE IN GENETIC TESTING OF TUMORS AND FOR HEREDITARY CANCER PREDISPOSITION SYNDROMES BUT GETTING TO PERSONALLY EXPERIENCE IT AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH IS INCREDIBLE,” DR. HASADSRI SAYS. “BY HAVING TESTING DONE, I GOT TO ACTUALLY SEE HOW IT PERFORMED AND WHEN THOSE TESTS BECAME CLINICALLY LIVE AND AVAILABLE TO ALL PATIENTS, I KNEW FROM TRULY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW FANTASTIC THOSE TESTS WERE.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the sensitivity and specificity of genetic sequencing have increased and genetic targets become more defined, it is possible that a genetic association with Lynch syndrome will eventually be discovered for Dr. Hasadsri. But to date, each new test has yielded negative results.</p>



<p>“I am definitely an example of how sometimes a negative result is just as powerful and just as relieving as a positive one,” Dr. Hasadsri says. “Or that it inches you a bit more toward closure. It's still very, very gratifying and satisfying because you're like, ‘OK, that's just one more piece of evidence that it's probably not something that I inherited or that my kids could inherit from me.’”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Translating experience into action</strong></h2>



<p>While Dr. Hasadsri’s interest in genetic testing evolved long before their personal journey intersected with hereditary cancer testing, the experience has fueled their passion.</p>



<p>“Just recently we had an example of a potentially difficult diagnosis with a pregnant patient, it was a condition that is tested for in our laboratory, and Dr. Hasadsri really went the extra mile to test additional family members and send tests kits out,” Dr. Wick says. “I think that is just part of their personality and how they function, and illustrated meeting the needs of the patients and going all out to make sure that happens.”</p>



<p>Having felt the many emotions that correspond with cancer testing, Dr. Hasadsri understands deeply what is at stake for patients seeking answers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“EVERY PATIENT DOES HAVE A LAB TEST AT SOME POINT, AND SO I THINK THAT LABORATORY MEDICINE AND PATHOLOGY IS ESPECIALLY RELATABLE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE FIELD,” DR. HASADSRI SAYS. “BUT IN MY CASE, I FEEL LIKE IT WAS EXTRA REAL BECAUSE I WAS THAT PATIENT GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS ANXIOUSLY WAITING. IF IT’S AT THE END OF THE DAY AND YOU’VE GOT AN EXTRA CASE, FOR INSTANCE, YOU WANT TO TAKE THE TIME TO GET THE CASE OUT, EVEN THOUGH IT’S STILL WITHIN TURNAROUND TIME AND COULD WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY, YOU DON’T BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE THAT PATIENT. BECAUSE YOU WERE THAT PATIENT.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"The entire spirit of doing the colonoscopy prep is to make sure that there is nothing in the colon," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<p>That's so your medical team can detect and remove&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-you-need-to-know-about-polyps-in-your-colon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polyps</a>&nbsp;or lesions.</p>



<p>"We frequently hear that the colon preparation can be a challenge," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to start bowel prep</h2>



<p>Review your prep guidelines one to two weeks before your procedure for any special instructions. You may be encouraged to make small changes in your diet starting a week before the procedure.</p>



<p>Often, the day before the colonoscopy is when you'll start the bowel prep solution. Dr. Ebner says this is where people may struggle.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for taking bowel prep solution</h2>



<p>"There's a couple of tricks. Often, cooling the solution and drinking it through a straw can be helpful.&nbsp;Others like to have a small lime or lemon wedge that they just bite into after doing some of the solution," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<p>Chewing gum between sips of the solution also may help. And he says taking the solution is often spread out over two days, and that can help too.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>"Half of the volume is done the day before the procedure, the other half is done the day of the procedure. That helps make it a lot more tolerable.&nbsp;And, in fact, we get a better cleanout by doing that splitting," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Ebner says some adnominal cramping, bloating, discomfort or nausea during the bowel preparation is normal. "For those that do have nausea, slowing down how fast you're consuming the fluid can oftentimes be really helpful," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Carole Reisinger’s body was telling a story that nobody would ever want to hear.  </p>



<p>"It started last February when I was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney cancer</a>. Thanks to the medical staff at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>, five days later, I had a 9-by-5-centimeter tumor removed," says Carole Reisinger.</p>



<p>But it was during that surgery, the second story was about to be told.</p>



<p>"In the process of that surgery, the surgeons noticed my colon was inflamed and had a thickening of the wall.&nbsp; After speaking with the physicians a few days later, they proposed that I should get a colonoscopy done," the Warrens, Wisconsin, native adds.</p>



<p>After recovering, she took her physician's words to heart, and did the colonoscopy. It's something she says she should have done sooner.</p>



<p>"I had been having some signs of something wrong. My stomach had been crampy, and I did have blood in my stool at times," explains Reisinger.</p>



<p>In April, she was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884">rectal cancer</a>. </p>

<p>"Rectal cancer is a subset of colon cancer that is located at the final segment of your colon. Symptoms of bleeding and irregular bowel habits are common. Colon cancer begins when healthy cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. These changes unfortunately can also be hereditary," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/andrew-morris-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Morris, M.D</a>., <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/colon-and-rectal-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal and rectal surgeon</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse</a>. "Cancer inside the rectum (rectal cancer) and cancer inside the colon (colon cancer) are often referred to together as colorectal cancer."</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a> is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and the fourth-leading cause in women. The lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women.</p>



<p>The 64-year-old had to battle her second cancer in a matter of months. For the next six months, Reisinger would go through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> and then radiation treatments at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/oncology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse</a>. In January of 2024, Dr. Morris and his surgical team removed the cancer, including most of the rectum.</p>



<p>"Advances in surgery have allowed colon and rectal cancers to be removed in a minimally invasive (small incision) fashion, often using the da Vinci robotic surgical system. Mrs. Reisinger was able to have the cancer completely removed, including the lymph nodes, and her colon reattached. Her recovery was generally quick due to the minimal pain related to the small incisions," Dr. Morris says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/rectal-bleeding/basics/causes/sym-20050740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Signs and symptoms</a> of rectal cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li>A change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation or more-frequent bowel movements.</li>



<li>Dark maroon or bright red blood in stool.</li>



<li>Narrow stool.</li>



<li>A feeling that your bowel doesn't empty completely.</li>



<li>Abdominal pain.</li>



<li>Unexplained weight loss.</li>



<li>Weakness or fatigue.</li>
</ul>



<p>In some families, gene mutations are passed from parents to children increasing the risk of colorectal cancer. One in 3 people who develop colorectal cancer have other family members who have had it. Reisinger wasn't one of them.</p>



<p>"I know of no family history of colon cancer," she says. "After I was diagnosed, we did genetic testing, and that also came up with nothing. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones."</p>



<p>Besides family history, there are other factors that can lead to colon cancer:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Older age.</strong>&nbsp;Colorectal cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but most people with this type of cancer are older than 50. The rates of colorectal cancer in people younger than 50 have been increasing, but doctors aren't sure why.</li>



<li><strong>African American descent.</strong>&nbsp;People of African ancestry born in the U.S. have a greater risk of colorectal cancer than do people of European ancestry.</li>



<li><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease.</strong>&nbsp;Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon and rectum, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, increase your risk of colorectal cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Eating a diet low in vegetables.</strong>&nbsp;Colorectal cancer may be associated with a diet low in vegetables and high in red meat, particularly when the meat is charred or well-done.</li>



<li><strong>Too little exercise.</strong>&nbsp;If you're inactive, you're more likely to develop colorectal cancer. Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Diabetes.</strong>&nbsp;People with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Obesity.</strong>&nbsp;Obese people have an increased risk of colorectal cancer when compared with people considered at a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Smoking.</strong>&nbsp;People who smoke may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Drinking alcohol.</strong>&nbsp;Regularly drinking more than three alcoholic beverages a week may increase your risk of colorectal cancer.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/colorectal-cancer/statistics#:~:text=For%20rectal%20cancer%2C%20the%20overall,relative%20survival%20rate%20is%2074%25." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recent research</a> shows the overall five-year relative survival rate for people diagnosed with rectal cancer is 68%. If the cancer is diagnosed at a localized stage, the survival rate is 90%. If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues, organs and/or the regional lymph nodes, the five-year relative survival rate is 74%.</p>



<p>"The advances in chemotherapy, immunotherapy and surgical techniques are improving these survival rates in both rectal and colon cancer. Thankfully, the multiteam approach that is provided at Mayo with these cancers makes sure all treatment options and even study protocols are being used. Early detection is key though, as it gives the best chances for a cure," states Dr. Morris.</p>



<p>Reisinger's outlook is good. She can't thank the surgeons, physicians and medical staff at both Mayo Clinic in Rochester and Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse enough for helping her through both medical situations.</p>



<p>She does point out that all women (and men) should take responsibility and control of their own healthcare now and not wait until it's too late.</p>



<p>"My advice is to not put off a colonoscopy," says Reisinger. "Start at the age of 45 and begin paying attention to your body. Pay attention to your own bowel movements. They are a tattletale to your health."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
