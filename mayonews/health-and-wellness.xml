<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My spouse suffers from chronic pain after a back injury five years ago. The pain affects his ability to work and enjoy day-to-day activities with our family. Seeing him in pain and not knowing how to help is difficult for me. How can I support him on the challenging days when the pain is more severe and encourage him on the good days?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> For millions of people, living with chronic pain can significantly affect their daily activities, relationships, work and well-being. Chronic pain is typically categorized based on the duration of pain experienced.</p>



<p>The pain or discomfort people feel while recovering from an injury or illness is considered acute or subacute. Pain lasting beyond usual recovery from a trauma-related event or surgery, typically 12 weeks, is considered chronic. Pain can transition from acute to chronic, depending on a person's recovery process.</p>



<p>Chronic pain can cause a person to avoid activities that cause further pain. This can lead to muscle weakness, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/radiofrequency-ablation-pain-relief?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joint problems</a> and being more prone to injury. These avoidance behaviors also can lead to psychological isolation and stress. Moving the body and being physically active are crucial for long-term pain management. Encouragement from family, friends and caregivers to stay active and motivated is vital in improving physical health and psychological well-being.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/8-tips-for-managing-chronic-pain?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Central sensitization pain</a> presents additional challenges, including mood changes and fatigue. Patients with central sensitization pain may experience heightened pain responses during physical activity.</p>



<p>It's important that loved ones understand the effect of chronic pain on a person's daily life. Not being able to engage with family and friends can lead to mood symptoms, such as anxiety, helplessness and hopelessness.</p>



<p>It's beneficial to encourage people with chronic pain to maintain a sense of normalcy, remain involved in social activities and stick to a routine sleep schedule.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/caregiving-self-care-during-beyond-the-covid-19-pandemic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">caregivers</a> should balance encouraging activity and enabling passivity, as helping can exacerbate physical and psychological limitations and dependency.</p>



<p>When supporting someone with chronic pain, here are some ways a loved one can help:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Understand the nature of chronic pain.<br></strong>Recognize that chronic pain differs from acute pain and can last beyond the expected recovery period. Be aware of the different types of chronic pain and their effect on your loved one's life.</li>



<li><strong>Encourage movement and physical activity.<br></strong>Motivate the person to do gentle exercises, stretching or physical therapy, even if it initially causes some discomfort. Gradually increasing activity levels can help improve pain and overall functioning.</li>



<li><strong>Support a balanced routine.<br></strong>Help establish a regular <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ways-to-get-better-sleep?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep schedule</a> and ensure the person is exposed to daylight during the day. Encourage healthy habits, such as maintaining a nutritious diet and avoiding substances like drugs or smoking. Understand that someone with chronic pain may have fluctuating levels of pain. Encourage them to participate in social events and integrate into family meals or outings when they feel up to it.</li>



<li><strong>Provide emotional support.</strong><br>Chronic pain can take a toll on a person's mental health. Listen when needed, offer emotional support and encourage open communication about their feelings and experiences. Help them seek professional help if needed. Understand that pain can be unpredictable, and the person may have good and bad days. Practice patience, flexibility and adaptability to accommodate their needs and limitations.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid enabling behaviors.<br></strong>While being empathetic is important, avoid reinforcing a sedentary or inactive lifestyle. Encourage independence and motivate the person to participate in their daily activities as much as possible.</li>



<li><strong>Stay informed and advocate for proper medical care.</strong><br>Educate yourself about the specific condition causing pain, available treatments and strategies for managing pain. This knowledge will help you better understand and support the person's journey. Help the person find healthcare professionals who specialize in chronic pain management. Advocate for their needs and ensure they receive appropriate medical attention, including seeking second opinions if necessary.</li>



<li><strong>Encourage self-care.</strong><br>Remind the person to prioritize self-care, including practicing <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/mindfulness-meditation-improve-your-quality-of-life?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaxation techniques</a>, pursuing hobbies and engaging in activities that bring joy and reduce stress.</li>
</ul>



<p>Remember, people's experience with chronic pain is unique to them, so it's essential to tailor your support to their needs. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/qasim-raza-mbbs-md?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Qasim Raza, M.B.B.S., M.D.</strong></em></a><strong><em>, Pain Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>Barron</strong></em></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire">Eau Claire</a></strong></em><strong><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire">, Wisconsin</a></em></strong></p>

<p>Editor's Note: October 18th is World Menopause Day</p>



<p>Women typically go through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a> between the ages of 45-55.

<p>It's difficult to drift off into dreamland when dealing with hot flashes and night sweats. These are just some of the symptoms that women in menopause go through.</p>



<p>"I had one woman described that she sweated out her mattress, and the mattress molded because she was sweating so much at night. So, this can really be a significant problem, and it can disrupt sleep," says Dr. Faubion.</p>



<p>She says hormonal fluctuations can affect the sleep cycle and sometimes cause insomnia. Mood changes and anxiety also will keep some women up at night, counting sheep.</p>



<p>"We do know that hormone therapy does tend to help with a lot of those factors and does help improve sleep," says Dr. Faubion.</p>



<p>Setting up a sleep routine is crucial for menopausal women. Simple things like limiting caffeine and screen time can make it easier to fall asleep.</p>



<p>"Like making sure you get enough exercise but not right before bed, avoiding a heavy meal right before bed — those are some of the things that you can do to help maintain a good night's sleep," says Dr. Faubion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for better sleep during menopause</h3>



<ul>
<li>Avoid heavy meals before bed.</li>



<li>Minimize exposure to light before bed.</li>



<li>Avoid napping after 3 p.m.</li>



<li>Don't exercise before bed.</li>



<li>Create relaxing bedtime ritual.</li>



<li>Keep electronics out of bedroom.</li>



<li>Stick to sleep schedule.</li>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My husband and I want to expand our family and are trying to get pregnant with our first baby. I've read about family planning couples can do before conceiving and learned about carrier screening. We don’t have a family history of genetic conditions, but we want to know if there is a chance of passing a genetic disorder to our child. What is carrier screening? And how does it help couples with family planning?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>When planning a family, you and your partner may choose to have genetic testing before having children to determine if you have a risk of passing on specific genetic disorders.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/genetic-testing-and-cardiac-conditions" data-wplink-edit="true">Genetic testing</a> is available to people who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Carrier screening is important in family planning as it helps identify genetic conditions that can be passed on to children.</p>



<p>Based on your family history or pedigree, a genetic counselor can advise:</p>



<ul>
<li>What type of genetic screening to consider, and whether your insurance coverage will apply to the cost.</li>



<li>What genetic testing may or may not determine.</li>



<li>Your potential risk of passing genetic disorders onto your children.</li>
</ul>



<p>People should consider genetic counseling and testing regardless of their <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/knowing-and-recording-your-family-health-history" data-wplink-edit="true">family history</a> of inherited conditions such as cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy or muscular dystrophy. Approximately 80% of children who develop a genetic disorder have no family history of the condition.</p>



<p>People receive two copies of each gene in their body — one inherited from the mother and the other from the father. Carrier screening determines if a person carries a non-working copy of a gene associated with a specific genetic condition.</p>



<p>People with one working copy and one nonworking copy of a gene are referred to as a "carrier" for the condition. They are typically not affected by the condition themselves. This is because carriers have one copy of the gene that functions normally, providing them protection against the condition. Most people are carriers of at least one genetic condition, and some are carriers of more than one condition.</p>



<p>Autosomal recessive conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, occur when a person inherits two nonworking copies of a gene — one gene from each of the parents who are carriers.</p>



<p>If a person is identified as a carrier, then their partner, egg donor or sperm donor is offered the same testing to determine if they are carriers of the same conditions. If both planned biological parents are carriers of the same condition, there is a 25% chance that their child may inherit two nonworking copies of the gene and be affected by the condition. Approximately 2% to 3% of couples are carriers of the same condition.</p>



<p>Although certain genetic conditions may be individually rare, collectively, their prevalence is more significant and accounts for more than 10% of pediatric deaths.</p>



<p>While carrier screening can be done when a person is pregnant, it is especially beneficial for preconception planning. Couples are empowered to make informed decisions about <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/genetic-counseling-for-family-planning" data-wplink-edit="true">family planning</a>, taking into account their carrier status for specific conditions. Based on the screening findings, some people may opt for alternative reproductive measures, such as in vitro fertilization.</p>



<p>Carrier testing may look for a single genetic condition based on family history. Expanded carrier screening looks for genes linked to many genetic diseases that are not only based on family history or ethnic background.</p>



<p>Carrier screening is now more accessible and affordable than ever before. Couples discussing family planning can ask their care team for a referral to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/medical-genetics" data-wplink-edit="true">genetic counseling</a>. Self-referral for the service also is available. Genetic counseling appointments can be conducted virtually with genetic testing performed through a blood draw or a saliva test.</p>



<p>After genetic testing, the genetic counselor explains the results and what risks, if any, have been identified. The information is shared with the patient's primary care clinician or OB-GYN.</p>



<p>Carrier screening is a valuable tool in family planning, <a data-wplink-edit="true" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/preparing-for-a-baby-together">offering couples</a> vital information about their carrier status for up to 500 genetic conditions and the risk of passing those conditions on to their children. It can help people make informed decisions about reproductive options and allows for early intervention and treatment if necessary. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/rebecca-jirik-cgc?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><strong><em>Rebecca Jirik</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Genetic Counseling, Mayo Clinic Health System, <a data-wplink-edit="true" href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire">Eau Claire, Wisconsin</a></em></strong></p>

<p>There are plenty of frights to go around on Halloween, but a hand injury probably isn't one you'd expect.</p>



<p>"Interestingly, it's the fourth busiest holiday for hand injuries," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kakar-sanjeev-sanj-m-d/bio-20055340?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Sanj Kakar</a>, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic hand and wrist surgeon.</p>



<p>Dr. Kakar says almost one-third of those Halloween hand injuries are among kids 10 to 14. And most of them happen when people are carving pumpkins.</p>

<p>"It's primarily stabbing injuries where the knife may slip, and, so, they can cut things like tendons, which are the ropes that help move your hands," Dr. Kakar says. "But they can also break bones, and also they can burn themselves, as well, with candles."</p>



<p>But Dr. Kakar says most of the injuries are avoidable.</p>



<p>"A lot of people might just go to the kitchen and grab a sharp knife. But there's good studies out there showing that actual pumpkin-specific carving knives [are safer], [because] actually the force needed to injure yourself, is higher if you use one of those than if you use a standard knife," he says. "So I would use a pumpkin carving kit, No. 1."</p>



<p>No. 2, Dr. Kakar says, is to let kids handle designing the jack-o'-lantern, but make sure adults do all of the carving.</p>



<p>And No. 3, make sure you're always supporting the pumpkin with your noncutting hand.</p>



<p>"So if you're right-handed, use your left hand to support the pumpkin and carve from the top down as opposed to the bottom up," Dr. Kakar says. "It's very easy for the knife to slip and go into your hand."</p>

<p>"We know that our population-level immunity to influenza is lower than usual because we've had lower rates during the COVID times," says Dr. Rajapakse. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7392467/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Public health measures</a> during the pandemic — wearing masks, washing hands and social distancing — not only help reduce COVID-19 transmission but also lowered the spread of the flu.</p>



<p>"Fewer people have had influenza infection and illness. They don't have the antibodies from that experience. We're all the more dependent on the antibodies from vaccination to protect us in that situation," she says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why get a flu shot</h3>



<p>Dr. Rajapakse says getting vaccinated is an important way to build immunity and prevent infection.</p>



<p>The recommendations still remain that anyone over six months of age should get an influenza vaccine this year," she says.</p>



<p>"And so the recommendations still remain that anyone over 6 months of age should get an influenza vaccine this year.”</p>



<p>Especially young children, older adults and those with weakened immune systems who are at higher risk of severe illness due to the flu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"People's protection is going to come from vaccination rather than recent infection. And that makes it all the more important to get the vaccine," says Dr. Rajapakse. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Who should get flu shot</h3>



<p>Everyone aged 6 months and older should get a yearly flu vaccine. It's especially important for those at a higher risk of severe flu complications. </p>



<p>Those at higher risk of complications from flu include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Young children under age 2.</li>



<li>Adults older than age 65.</li>



<li>Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.</li>



<li>People who are pregnant or plan to be pregnant during flu season.</li>



<li>People with weakened immune systems.</li>



<li>American Indians or Alaska Natives.</li>



<li>People with chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and diabetes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Getting the flu shot has important benefits. It reduces flu cases, doctor visits, missed work and school days due to flu, and lessens symptom severity, lowering flu-related hospitalizations and deaths.</p>



<p>Along with vaccination, practicing good hand hygiene and avoiding people who are ill are ways to prevent transmission and illness.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidney stones</a>&nbsp;are small, hard deposits made of minerals and reoccurring materials inside the kidneys. Stones often go unnoticed in the kidney until they move into the ureter —the tube connecting the kidney and bladder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a stone leaves the kidney and blocks urine from exiting, usually while in the ureter, it can cause urine to back up and lead to intense pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kidney stones are common, affecting about 12% of the U.S. population. Kidney stone development usually begins when people are in their 20s or 30s, and the problem can continue for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many things can increase your risk for stones, including family history, health factors like diabetes, dietary habits or if your urine lacks substances to prevent crystals from sticking together.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Types of kidney stones</h3>



<p>There are four types of kidney stones. Knowing the type of your kidney stone will help determine its cause and give you clues on how to reduce your chance of developing more stones.&nbsp;If you pass a kidney stone, try to save it to give to your healthcare team for analysis.</p>



<p>Types of kidney stones include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Calcium stones</strong>&nbsp;<br>This is the most common type of kidney stone. About 70% to 80% of kidney stones are calcium stones, which are usually made of calcium and oxalate. Oxalate is a substance produced by the liver and also absorbed from your diet. Certain fruits and vegetables, like spinach, have high oxalate content. Taking high doses of vitamin D and vitamin C, gastric surgery and several metabolic disorders can increase the concentration of calcium or oxalate in your urine.</li>
</ul>



<p>Calcium stones can also be made of calcium phosphate. This type of stone is more common in people with metabolic conditions like renal tubular acidosis. It may also be associated with some medications used to treat migraines (topiramate) or blood pressure (furosemide or triamterene).</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Struvite stones</strong>&nbsp;<br>Struvite stones can form after a urinary tract infection. These stones can grow quickly and become large, sometimes with few symptoms or little warning.</li>



<li><strong>Uric acid stones</strong>&nbsp;<br>Uric acid stones can form in people who lose too much fluid because of chronic diarrhea or malabsorption, eat a high-protein diet or who have gout. Certain genetic factors also may increase your risk of uric acid stones.</li>



<li><strong>Cystine stones</strong>&nbsp;<br>These stones form in people with a hereditary disorder called cystinuria, which causes the kidneys to excrete too much of a specific amino acid.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing kidney stones</h3>



<p>Nearly 50% of people who have developed kidney stones will develop another stone in 10 years if they do not take steps to prevent a recurrence. Usually, this includes a combination of lifestyle changes and medications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lifestyle changes</h3>



<p>You may reduce your risk of kidney stones if you:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Drink water throughout the day.&nbsp;</strong><br>People with a history of kidney stones should drink enough fluids to pass about 80 oz (2.5 liters) of urine every day. This is the most effective therapy available to prevent future kidney stones. Your healthcare team may ask you to measure your urine output to ensure you drink enough water.</li>



<li><strong>Eat fewer oxalate-rich foods.</strong>&nbsp;<br>Switching to a diet low in oxalates can reduce your risk of calcium oxalate stones. Foods that are highest in oxalates include spinach, rhubarb, baked potatoes, lentils, navy beans, bran, grits and almonds.</li>
</ul>



<p>A high amount of salt and animal protein in your diet can also increase your kidney stone risk. A diet lower in sodium and higher in potassium — contained in many fruits and vegetables — can reduce the risk of stone formation.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Continue eating calcium-rich foods, but use caution with calcium supplements.</strong>&nbsp;<br>Calcium in food can actually lower your risk of kidney stones. Continue eating calcium-rich foods unless your healthcare team recommends otherwise. Talk with your healthcare team before taking calcium supplements, however, because these may be linked to an increased risk of kidney stones.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Take steps to reduce urinary tract infections.</strong>&nbsp;<br>Some people are more susceptible to developing recurrent urinary tract infections. Fewer infections can reduce the risk of developing&nbsp;struvite stones.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-tips-to-prevent-a-urinary-tract-infection">Get tips for preventing urinary tract infections</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Medications</h3>



<p>Medications can control the amount of minerals and salts in the urine and may be helpful in people who form certain kinds of stones. The type of medication your doctor prescribes will depend on the type of kidney stones you have and the specific makeup of your urine, which is determined by testing. Some medications can reduce uric acid levels in the blood and reduce your risk of uric acid stones, while others increase the solubility of cystine in your urine and lower your risk of cystine stones.</p>



<p>Kidney stone formation is specific to each person, so it's important to work with your healthcare team to develop a personalized&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355759?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">treatment plan</a>. That plan should consider what kind of kidney stones you have, possible causes for their formation and specific steps to prevent them.</p>

<p>Of all the symptoms associated with psoriasis of the scalp, many patients find the itch most bothersome.</p>



<p>"Oftentimes patients will have scales on their skin on their scalp that itches or kind of stings when they go to shampoo their scalp, and they just assume that it's really bad dandruff," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>Dr. Davis says psoriasis is thought to be an immune system issue that results in faster-than-normal growth of skin cells.</p>

<p>"Typically, skin will grow and shed in 28-to-30-day cycles, but psoriasis skin grows and tries to shed in a 72-hour cycle. It’s almost growing 10 times the speed of normal skin," she says.</p>



<p>There is no cure for psoriasis, but there are <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriasis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355845?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatments</a>.</p>



<p>"The treatments we use for psoriasis help decrease the inflammation in the skin and turn off that cell cascade of the immune system," Dr. Davis says.</p>



<p>Dr. Davis says maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding tobacco and excess alcohol can help to decrease the severity of psoriasis.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> How to manage symptoms of psoriasis</h3>



<ul>
<li>Apply moisturizer daily.</li>



<li>Use gentle or mild soap.</li>



<li>Don't scratch. </li>



<li>Avoid stress. </li>
</ul>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team for treatment or new strategy options if the discomfort of psoriasis is affecting your quality of life.</p>

Verified centers must meet criteria outlined in CSV standards by ensuring that children facing surgery receive care under a multidisciplinary program with quality improvement and safety processes, data collection and appropriate resources provided to them as patients at the hospital.<br>&nbsp;<br>The CSV program is based on other nationally recognized American College of Surgeons quality improvement programs that have measurably improved surgical quality, prevented complications, reduced costs and saved lives.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Every day, our team at the Mayo Clinic Children's Center provides the highest quality care to pediatric patients suffering the most complex and heart-wrenching illnesses, from congenital anomalies to pediatric oncology," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/flick-randall-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20053420?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Randall Flick, M.D.</a>, medical director of Mayo Clinic Children's Center. "We are incredibly proud of the ACS's verification of our team's hard work transforming children's lives and operating at the forefront of healthcare's capability."<br>&nbsp;<br>Mayo Clinic Children's Center's commitment to quality care begins with appropriately trained staff and leadership from surgeons who participate in meetings throughout the year to review the center's surgical outcomes. The surgical team seeks continuous improvement to enhance the structure, process and outcomes of the center.<br>&nbsp;<br>To become a verified center, Mayo Clinic Children's Center met essential criteria for staffing, training and facility infrastructure, and protocols for care, ensuring its ability to appropriately care for children who are surgical patients. The center also participates in a national data registry that yields semiannual reports on the quality of its processes and outcomes, thus identifying opportunities for continuous quality improvement.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The American College of Surgeons sets a very high standard for quality and organization of their surgical programs," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/potter-d-dean-jr-m-d/bio-20154706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">D. Dean Potter Jr., M.D.</a>, a pediatric surgeon who led Mayo Clinic Children's Center's efforts to achieve ACS CSV verification. "The verification is not about meeting common standards for care. It's about demonstrating how we work as a multidisciplinary team to provide the highest quality of care and continually improve as healthcare evolves. Our teams are filled with joy at this recognition of the hard work they do each day."<br>&nbsp;<br>After submitting an application, centers seeking verification undergo an extensive site visit by an ACS team of surveyors. The surveyor teams consist of experienced children's surgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses who review the center's structure, process and clinical outcomes data. The current Optimal Resources for Children's Surgical Care manual drives the application and is used as a guideline in conducting the survey.</p>



<p>"Receiving the verification justifies and recognizes all the work that everyone does," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/warner-lindsay-l-m-d/bio-20528409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lindsay Warner, M.D.,</a> director of Performance Improvement and Patient Safety for the Pediatric Surgical Practice. "It allows us to share with everyone what we've always known: that Mayo Clinic Children's Center provides the highest quality care&nbsp;— and is an incredibly special place — for our smallest patients."</p>

<p><a href="https://wmhdofficial.com/about-the-world-mental-health-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Mental Health Day</a> will be observed on Tuesday, Oct. 10. The <a href="https://wmhdofficial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">theme of this year's recognition</a> is "Mental Health is a Universal Human Right."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/mental-health/art-20044098?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental health</a> is the overall wellness of how you think, regulate your feelings and behave. A mental disorder may be present when patterns or changes in thinking, feeling or behaving cause distress or disrupt a person's ability to function.</p>



<p>Cultural norms and social expectations also play a role in defining mental health. There is no standard measure across cultures to determine whether a behavior is normal or when it becomes disruptive. What might be normal in one society may be a cause for concern in another.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/symptoms-causes/syc-20374968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental illness</a> refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function. About 1 in 5 adults has a mental illness in any given year, and mental illness can begin at any age.</p>



<p>Examples of mental illness include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Depression.</li>



<li>Anxiety disorders.</li>



<li>Schizophrenia.</li>



<li>Eating disorders.</li>



<li>Addictive behaviors.</li>
</ul>



<p>Access to mental health treatment is an important part of overall healthcare services. It's also important to understand the roles of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health-providers/art-20045530?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different types of mental health specialists</a> to find the one that fits your needs. The best choice for your care will depend on your concern or condition; whether you need medications, counseling or both; and your health insurance coverage. Finding the right match is crucial to establishing a good relationship and getting the most out of your treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374974?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment</a> depends on the type of mental illness, its severity and what works best for you. In many cases, a combination of treatments may be recommended. If you have a mild mental illness with well-controlled symptoms, treatment from your primary healthcare professional may be sufficient. However, often a team approach is appropriate to make sure all your psychiatric, medical and social needs are met.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, negative attitudes and beliefs toward people who have a mental health condition are common. Others' judgments almost always stem from a lack of understanding rather than information based on facts.

<p>When does a trickle sound like a waterfall? After you get hearing aids, according to Charlie Pierce.</p>



<p>"I spent so many years not hearing the things that I can hear now. I can hear the smallest noise in the next room," he says. "It's incredible."</p>



<p>Charlie's improved hearing has done more than amplify the sounds he hears ― it helped the 55-year-old start a new career.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Construction work and overcoming addiction</h2>



<p>For over 40 years, Charlie worked in construction. But his career was beginning to take a toll on his body, and he felt drawn to a different path — working with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).</p>



<p>"I started the application process to work for the TSA, but I talked myself out of it," Charlie recalls, feeling that the timing wasn't right.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="325" height="325" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/pierces.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-374404 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/pierces.jpg 325w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/pierces-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/pierces-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Charlie continued his job as a construction superintendent in Tennessee. He also overcame a 38-year addiction to drugs and alcohol, thanks to attending two addiction recovery programs in 2019. He and wife, Amy Pierce, were married the following year.</p>



<p>"Amy and I agreed that we wouldn't make any other major life changes until I was a year sober," he says.</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making a change</h2>



<p>In September 2022, the Pierces decided to relocate to Faribault, Minnesota, to be closer to family. When Charlie saw an advertisement for TSA positions at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, he knew just what to do.</p>



<p>"It seemed like a God moment that I was seeing it again, so I applied," he says.</p>



<p>During the application screening and medical exam process, Charlie learned that years of construction and power tools had taken more than just a toll on his muscles and joints. He had hearing loss that could potentially exclude him from a TSA career.</p>



<p>Time was of the essence for Charlie in addressing his hearing issue. He knew that his application would be denied for medical reasons if he failed the hearing test.</p>



<p>"I knew I needed to see someone right away," he says. "I wasn't just going to give up at that point."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/hearing-aids.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-374403" style="width:480px;height:332px" width="480" height="332" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/hearing-aids.jpg 325w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/hearing-aids-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Audiology, hearing aids to the rescue</h2>



<p>A week later, Charlie's hearing was evaluated by audiologist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/albert-lea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dana McCray, Au.D.</a>, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/albert-lea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Albert Lea</a>, Minnesota.</p>



<p>"When Charlie arrived in my office, it was evident that it was extraordinarily important to him to get into TSA," says Dr. McCray. "He shared some of his story with me and how he was really working hard to get on a better path."</p>



<p>Dr. McCray thoroughly tested Charlie's hearing and discovered that his damage was different in each ear.</p>



<p>"In most cases when hearing changes, it happens equally, left and right," says Dr. McCray. "His loss is milder on the left and moderately severe on the right. We may never really know what caused the greater loss for Charlie in just one ear."</p>



<p>Dr. McCray explained the degree of Charlie's hearing loss to him and recommended hearing aids to improve it. Hearing aids digitally process incoming sounds. They make soft sounds more audible while keeping a limit on the overall output so that the volume isn't too loud.</p>



<p>Charlie was fitted with hearing aids that have a small instrument behind the ear connected to a domed earpiece in each canal. Dr. McCray explains that this style is comfortable for people who wear glasses like Charlie. They are also well-suited for the field he wanted to enter.</p>



<p>"Charlie needed something that would help him hear as clearly as possible in difficult environments with background noise," says Dr. McCray. "His hearing aids are the same model in each ear, but they are programmed differently based on his hearing loss."</p>



<p>Dr. McCray explains that some professions — including construction — increase the risk of hearing loss due to loud noises from equipment or instruments used. Some other examples include mechanics, truck drivers, farmers, factory workers, surgeons and dentists.</p>



<p>"If your employer requires hearing protection on the job, use it. Noisy hobbies, like woodworking, hunting and engine repairs, should also include hearing protection when sound levels are high," says Dr. McCray. "Hearing loss has an additive effect over a lifetime so preserving [hearing] early makes a difference."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moving forward</h2>



<p>Two weeks after his initial appointment, Charlie got his new hearing aids. Dr. McCray completed the necessary paperwork and testing so he would clear the employment medical evaluation. He was hired by the TSA and began training.</p>



<p>In July, Charlie was selected to give the graduation address at the end of TSA training. He shared his speech with Dr. McCray at a follow-up appointment.</p>



<p>"It was really moving to know that all his effort and hard work had brought him to that grand conclusion," says Dr. McCray. "I am really proud of him."</p>



<p>Charlie says he is enjoying his new career at the airport and is grateful for the expertise of the Mayo Clinic Health System&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/audiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audiology</a>&nbsp;team.</p>



<p>"The work that Dr. McCray did was above and beyond to help make all this stuff come to fruition for me," he says. "She is like a master of her craft and knew exactly what we needed to do."</p>
