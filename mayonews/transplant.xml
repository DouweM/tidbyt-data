<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> surgeons successfully performed Minnesota's first robotic-assisted kidney transplant earlier this month. This minimally invasive procedure may be beneficial for patients with a higher body mass index and may reduce the risk of incisional complications, such as hernia or infection.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's first robotic-assisted kidney transplant was successfully performed on Oct. 4 on a woman in her 60s who received a kidney from her daughter.</p>



<p>“Mayo Clinic has been a leader in the field of kidney transplants for six decades. We are proud to continue that tradition by completing the first robotic-assisted kidney transplant in Minnesota," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-timucin-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055648?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Timucin Taner, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, division chair of Transplant Surgery at Mayo Clinic. Dr. Taner and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dean-patrick-g-m-d/bio-20054709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Dean, M.D.</a>, performed the robotic-assisted surgery.</p>



<p>For patients with kidney failure, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> remains the best treatment available. Most kidney transplants are done via open surgery. The surgeon makes an incision 4- to 8-inches long on the right or left side of the lower abdomen to transplant the donated kidney. For a robotic-assisted kidney transplant, the surgeon makes a roughly 2-inch incision around the belly button and a smaller incision to insert the robotic instruments. The surgeon sits at a console that controls the surgical robot.</p>



<p>“A robotic-assisted kidney transplant requires a smaller incision. It lowers the risk that patients will experience complications, such as an infection or hernia. Patients may also have less discomfort and a speedier recovery, potentially meaning less time in the hospital after surgery," says Dr. Dean, surgical director of Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/kidney-transplant/sections/overview/ovc-20203202?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidney Transplant Program</a> in Minnesota.</p>

<p>For most patients, the traditional kidney surgery method remains the best option. It is safe and successful.</p>



<p>“Robotic-assisted kidney transplant will not replace open kidney transplantation entirely,” Dr. Taner says. “It will, however, offer another option for those who may benefit from an alternative incision site — especially those with higher body mass indexes, previous hernias or prior abdominal surgeries.”</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is the largest integrated transplant center in the U.S. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a> in Minnesota performed 311 kidney transplants in 2022 — more than any other transplant center in the state.</p>

<p>In the U.S., <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17 people</a> die every day while waiting for an organ transplant.</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of people on <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=27#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of,percent%20of%20white%20living%20donors.">transplant waiting lists</a> come from minority communities, while about 30% of donors are people of color.</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/does-my-race-ethnicity-matter-in-organ-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood types</a> and certain HLA, or antibodies, tend to correlate with various ethnic groups," says Dr. Mao. "So it is not directly related to a particular minority group; however, organs will end up with someone of a similar background because the better matched an organ is, the more longevity that organ has."</p>



<p>Higher rates of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are present in minority communities, contributing to more organ failures.</p>



<p>"The more people we can help the sooner through transplant, the better," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>She says living donors do not experience a change in their quality of life after surgery, but a recipient's life can change for the better almost immediately.</p>



<p>"If somebody is approved to be a <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/process/living-donation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donor</a>, we expect they will live a full and normal life following their donation process," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>In most states, <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signing up</a> to be a donor after death can be done online or when registering for a driver's license or identification card. For a <a href="https://www.kidneyregistry.org/for-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donation</a>, contact the recipient's care team or a <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant center</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Today is National Navajo Code Talkers Day - a day to honor the group of U.S. Marines who created a secret code credited with helping the U.S. win World War II.</p>



<p>At 94 years old, Peter MacDonald Sr. is the youngest of three surviving Navajo code talkers in the world. </p>



<p>He visited Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona to share his defining chapter in American history. MacDonald also made a personal plea for improving access to high-quality healthcare for people in his homeland, which he hopes will be part of his legacy.</p>

<p>About 200 Mayo Clinic employees attended the special ceremony honoring National Navajo Code Talkers Day. Another 1,000 employees joined live online for the rare opportunity to step back in time and hear a firsthand account of events from the battlefields in 1942 that would shape American history. </p>



<p>MacDonald, now confined to a wheelchair, greeted the audience with a warm, energetic welcome and a touch of lightheartedness that brought chuckles to the crowd. If you want to keep a secret, MacDonald teased the crowd, "Just start talking to people in Navajo code," he said with a grin. "No one in the world will understand what you're talking about!"  </p>

<p>Before MacDonald began his story, he wanted to deliver a message. MacDonald asked the audience for their support in helping achieve health equity in Native American communities. "On the Navajo Reservation, we have so many health problems," explained MacDonald. He admitted that his efforts which began in the 1970s as chairman of the Navajo Nation to eliminate health disparities have fallen short. "I still feel that even today if you read the news, or watch TV, you know there are a lot of illnesses on Navajos, like diabetes," said MacDonald. "It's high as opposed to what's in the rest of the country."</p>

<p>MacDonald shared his own experience of receiving medical care at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota 50 years ago. He was inspired by Mayo Clinic's multidisciplinary approach to medical care. "The doctor asked me a lot of questions, and then had me see three other specialists," said MacDonald. "The next day I went back and he had all the reports in front of him. He said 'Ok, this is how we are going to take care of you.' I will never forget that. We need that kind of care on the Navajo Reservation."</p>

<p>MacDonald applauded recent efforts by Mayo Clinic to eliminate barriers to healthcare for people in Native American communities with its <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/breaking-barriers-helping-native-americans-in-need-get-the-gift-of-life/">new community outreach program</a>.  A year ago Silena Thomas began working as a Native American patient outreach navigator for Mayo Clinic. Silena was born and raised on the Navajo Nation in northern Arizona. Fluent in both English and Navajo, Silena works connecting American Indians and Alaskan Natives with lifesaving organ transplants at Mayo Clinic. </p>

<p>Thomas has helped dozens of people navigate the maze of getting an organ transplant. "Many of the people living on the reservation don't have a phone, computer, or Wi-Fi to make appointments. Also, a lot of people don't have transportation. I help patients organize all those details so it's not so overwhelming," said Thomas. "Because I can speak the language and I understand the culture, patients feel more comfortable. It feels like home. For me, it feels like I'm talking to my mom or my grandma." </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Robert's story</h2>



<p>Robert Monroe and his wife Jackie live in a remote area with their children and grandchildren on the Navajo Reservation. Their small trailer has no air conditioning, a wood-burning stove for heat, intermittent cellphone service, and is miles from high-quality healthcare. Five years doctors told Monroe he would need weekly dialysis for a failing kidney. It was an hourlong drive to the closest dialysis center. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>"Mosty of the time I just ended up hitchhiking to get to kidney dialysis."</em></p><cite>Robert Monroe, Resident Navajo Nation</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"It would take the whole day and I couldn't be there to take care of our home and our family," said Monroe. It is almost two years after Monroe's successful transplant. "I'm grateful to Silena, and the person who gave me this new kidney. I've been able to get back to work and take care of my family."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The top-secret classroom</h2>



<p>After MacDonald's plea for support for his homeland, he spent nearly an hour sharing a vivid account of how the code talkers used a secret code they created based on the complex, unwritten Navajo language.  MacDonald described the top-secret classroom surrounded by armed guards and razor wire where the group of 29 Navajo service members converged to create the code. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="609" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-14-at-12.05.22-PM-1024x609.png" alt="" class="wp-image-372916" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-14-at-12.05.22-PM-1024x609.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-14-at-12.05.22-PM-300x178.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-14-at-12.05.22-PM-768x457.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-14-at-12.05.22-PM.png 1422w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>"In that classroom, were tables with four chairs around each table. On the walls were huge blackboards with chalk and erasers," described MacDonald. "Now we're talking June of 1942. The Marine Corps Colonel looked at us and said 'Gentlemen of the United States Marines, are you ready to go fight a war in the Pacific? But before you do that, we would love for you to do something else first. We'd like for you to develop a military code using your own language.'"</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>"Are you ready to go fight a war in the Pacific? Before you do that, we would love for you to do something else first. We'd like for you to develop a military code using your own language."</em></p><cite>Peter MAcDonald recalls the order by the U.S. Military in 1942</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>By the beginning of July, with part of the code created, MacDonald said they were given the order to find out of the code would work. "We're going to stop here. We're going to test this code," remembers MacDonald describing the Colonel's words. "You must develop an actual battle to see how your memory works under enemy fire. You can't write anything down because if you get shot the enemy will search you and find messages in your pocket. We don't want that," adds MacDonald.</p>

<p>The code was never cracked by the enemy. Historians argue the Navajo Code Talkers helped expedite the end of the war saving thousands of lives. It wasn't until 1968 the Navajo Code Talkers program was declassified by the military. Since then, the Navajo code talkers have drawn the attention of crowds eager to hear their war stories.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/statsmaps/current-season-data.html">confirmed</a>&nbsp;reports of West Nile virus in 10 states. The bite of an infected mosquito most commonly spreads the virus.</p>



<p>"West Nile virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne illness in the U.S.,"&nbsp;says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/pritt-bobbi-s-m-d/bio-20514068?_ga=2.154748797.494579088.1679408198-755292986.1678201035?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Bobbi Pritt,</a>&nbsp;director of the Clinical Parasitology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It's a flavivirus —a specific type of RNA virus that can infect humans, birds and horses.</p>



<p>"West Nile virus is transmitted predominantly through the bite of an infected mosquito. Less commonly, it can be transmitted through other means, like blood transfusion," says Dr. Pritt. "The mosquito that's most commonly implicated is the&nbsp;<em>Culex</em>&nbsp;mosquito, different from the&nbsp;<em>Anopheles</em>&nbsp;mosquito that transmits malaria."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms</h3>



<p>Most people infected with the West Nile virus do not experience any symptoms though some may develop a fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting and rash. While most people fully recover, some may experience ongoing weakness and fatigue for months.</p>



<p>Severe symptoms from West Nile virus are uncommon though people over 60 face a higher risk of severe illness if infected. Those with medical conditions, such as <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-make-changes-to-stop-prediabetes-from-developing-into-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/multimedia/vid-20538081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension</a> or <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-understanding-chronic-kidney-disease-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney disease</a>, or who have undergone organ transplants, also are at an increased risk of serious health complications due to the virus.</p>



<p>Severe symptoms affecting the nervous system develop in about 1 in 150 infected people,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/symptoms/index.html">according</a>&nbsp;to the CDC. Severe symptoms may include inflammation of the brain, known as <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-do-you-know-about-encephalitis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encephalitis</a>, or of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meningitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350508?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">meningitis</a>.</p>



<p>Seek medical attention immediately if you have signs or symptoms of a serious infection, such as severe headaches, a stiff neck, disorientation or confusion. Hospitalization is usually necessary for a serious infection.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Testing and diagnosis </h3>



<p>"West Nile virus infection is usually diagnosed by detecting antibodies in a patient's blood sample. It's a type of test that we call serology," says Dr. Pritt. "Mayo Clinic Laboratories also offers a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, test that's particularly good for the first day to several days of infection. Usually, PCR would be combined with serology so that you don't miss infection."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h3>



<p>Mosquitoes can transmit a number of harmful pathogens, says Dr. Pritt, including the West Nile virus and malaria. The best way to avoid mosquito-borne illness is to avoid mosquitoes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Consider these tips:</strong></p>



<p>• Use insect repellent with DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus.<br>• Wear permethrin-treated clothing while outdoors or in the woods.<br>• Empty standing water in outdoor areas, including pet bowls and rain barrels.<br>• Install screens in windows.</p>



<p>"There are also measures people can take to control mosquito populations around their home," she says. "It's important to know that mosquitoes breed and lay their eggs in bodies of water. One of those preventive measures is to remove standing bodies of water around the house, such as bird baths and other containers that may collect rainwater, for example. Then you could also pay to have the outside of your home professionally treated."</p>

<p>John and Stacy Reiser joke that their life is like a Hallmark movie — a classic boy meets girl, falls in love and gets married. Except in this Hallmark movie, the girl also saves the boy's life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their story goes like this:</p>



<p>Stacy, a diabetes educator at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, stumbled across John's profile on a dating app in 2019. His profile said he loved to be in the kitchen or on the grill making food, so she messaged him asking what his favorite thing was to cook.</p>



<p>"It took him a whole month to message back," teases Stacy, a nurse educator at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.</p>



<p>And it's a good thing he did.</p>



<p>They would turn out to be a perfect match. In two very important ways.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Budding romance, with time constraints</strong></h2>



<p>Before long, Stacy and John were talking on the phone almost every night. After getting to know each other a bit, Stacy decided it was time to meet in person. So one afternoon, she invited John to tag along to a beer expo she was attending with a friend.</p>



<p>"That's when I had to tell her I don't drink," John recalls. "And I had to tell her something serious.</p>



<p>John had <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iga-nephropathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20352268?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IgA nephropathy</a>, also known as Berger's disease, a kidney disease that occurs when an antibody called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in your kidneys. He was diagnosed in 2014, and by this time the disease had progressed significantly, requiring dialysis three times a week to remove waste and fluid from his blood.</p>



<p>To be added to the deceased organ donor <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a> list, John's doctor told him, would require losing a significant amount of weight.</p>



<p>"I was going to have gastric bypass, but the insurance company wouldn't cover it, so I decided to do it old school. It was do or die," John says.</p>



<p>On the days he didn't have dialysis, he worked out, sometimes twice a day, usually walking eight to 16 miles on a track at a nearby gym. This disciplined regimen, paired with an extremely restrictive diet, allowed him to lose over 140 pounds, qualifying him for the transplant list.</p>



<p>He waited for many months without a match, and he was running out of time.</p>



<p>That's when Stacy stepped in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saving the love of her life</strong></h2>



<p>Stacy was falling in love with John and seeing how much harder dialysis got for him, so she researched the requirements to become a living organ donor.</p>



<p>She found the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a> number and left a message requesting more information about becoming a living donor. Within a week, a living donor advocate contacted her and set the process in motion.</p>



<p>Stacy learned she was a match for John, but there was one other box she needed to check before they could schedule the transplant.</p>



<p>Living donors must have a body mass index of 35 or lower, and Stacy did not quite meet that threshold.</p>



<p>Luckily, though, she was already enrolled in a weight-loss study at Mayo Clinic. John was the incentive she needed to stick with it. In just three months, she lost 40 pounds and qualified to donate her kidney to John.</p>



<p>Without wasting any time, they scheduled the transplant.</p>



<p>On June 16, 2021, the operation took place.</p>



<p>"When I got to the operating room and saw her kidney, it finally felt real. I remember the doctor telling me to 'relax' because I was tense, and the next thing I knew I was waking up in recovery with a new kidney," John says.</p>



<p>I was so happy that I think I was probably even slightly annoying," he admits. "I'm so grateful Stacy did this for me. If it weren't for her, I would probably not be here."</p>



<p>Stacy is humble about the role she played in saving John's life.</p>



<p>"Here I was just trying to give away something I already had enough of to my best friend and soulmate, and everyone thought I was a superhero," Stacy says. "It’s already inside us — the gift to donate a kidney, part of a liver, bone marrow or something else. Might as well pay it forward and bring that light and love to others."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/skinnycouple16x9-1024x575.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-367051" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/skinnycouple16x9-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/skinnycouple16x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/skinnycouple16x9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/skinnycouple16x9-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/skinnycouple16x9.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kudos to the care team</strong></h2>



<p>Both John and Stacy say they are grateful for the care they received at Mayo Clinic before, during and since their operation.</p>



<p>"I felt supported and taken care of the entire time. At every office visit they would ask: Are you sure you want to go through with this?" Stacy recalls. "If I ever had doubts or wanted to give it more thought, I knew the living donor advocate team would step in like a mother bear and pause the journey while I took the time I needed."</p>



<p>As a nurse herself, Stacy had heard many out-of-state patients say how incredibly fortunate the locals are to have the country's top hospital nearby.</p>



<p>"I have a whole new level of pride after getting to experience the efficiency, professionalism and class firsthand as a patient," Stacy says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Life post-transplant</strong></h2>



<p>Since the transplant, Stacy and John have been happy, healthy and enjoying life.</p>



<p>John will take anti-rejection medication for life, and is committed to eating right and drinking plenty of water, but says he is feeling well.</p>



<p>Stacy says she feels better than ever.</p>



<p>"Many people told me going into the kidney donation that the surgery is harder on the donor than the recipient," Stacy says. "I disagree! I may have been lucky, but I had no issues during or after surgery. I do not notice any differences now with just one kidney."</p>

<p>The newlyweds are having fun discovering new hobbies together — traveling, trying new restaurants and riding motorcycles — and are looking forward to many more years of adventures together.</p>

<p>Travis Kelchen's path to a regenerative intervention at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> began when he was on vacation in the Dominican Republic and could barely walk at his brother's wedding. At 31, he was tired, winded and losing color. Within months, his cardiologist said he could not do anything more for Travis' congenital heart defect and referred him to Mayo Clinic. Travis arrived at Mayo just in time: His failing heart went into cardiac arrest.</p>



<p>Whether it was luck, fate or a miracle, his Mayo physician, the ICU team and the cardiac surgery team were all on duty at the time. They pulled together instantly, rushing Travis to the operating room and implanting a mechanical bridge to transplant.</p>



<p>"I just remember a bunch of doctors saying, 'Mr. Kelchen, I gotta shock you to bring you back,'" says Kelchen. "They kept me alive when a lot of people didn't think I would make it. I just have to say, 'Thank you' to the doctors."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Living with Ebstein anomaly</h2>



<p>Travis was born with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ebsteins-anomaly/symptoms-causes/syc-20352127#dialogId52948187?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ebstein anomaly</a>, a rare defect in which the tricuspid valve in the right side of the heart is malformed. The native of Monticello in eastern Iowa had few debilitating symptoms for most of his life. Silently, however, his heart was having difficulty pumping blood and had grown to more than five times its normal size to compensate.</p>



<p>"He needed a transplant, but he was too sick to have anesthesia. It was a complex case made even more risky by the size of his heart. He was not a good candidate for surgery at that time," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/behfar-atta-m-d-ph-d/bio-20149077?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atta Behfar, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a transplant cardiologist. "We chose an intervention that went through the skin and major blood vessels to stabilize his heart function without surgery." Dr. Behfar is the Russ and Kathy Van Cleve Professor of Regenerative Medicine and director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/van-cleve-cardiac-regenerative-medicine-program/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Van Cleve Cardiac Regenerative Medicine Program</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ECMO as a bridge to transplant</h2>



<p>Dr. Behfar and the cardiology team used <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ecmo/about/pac-20484615?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment (ECMO)</a> to bypass Travis' diseased heart. ECMO is a mechanical circulatory support device that pumps blood through body when the heart is too weak to function on its own.</p>



<p>"We believe this is one of the first cases, if not the first reported case, of successfully bridging an Ebstein's anomaly patient to transplant with a mechanical intervention of this type," says Dr. Behfar. "ECMO took pressure off his diseased right heart so it and nearby organs could regenerate and heal. Our goal was to get him well enough to tolerate a heart transplant."</p>



<p>The use of ECMO as a regenerative medicine bridge to transplant is a procedure Dr. Behfar's team studied and developed in the Mayo Clinic Van Cleve Cardiac Regenerative Medicine Program within Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>. Together with the cardiovascular transplant team, they are now bringing it to other patients with rare and complex conditions.</p>



<p>This first known documented use of ECMO as a bridge to transplant for Ebstein's anomaly is described in <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00003-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Successful transplant</h2>



<p>While on ECMO, Travis was able to get up, move around and participate in physical therapy. After 38 days, his heart was strong enough for anesthesia and he was taken off the machine. Eight days later, in May 2021, Travis received a heart transplant.</p>



<p>"When I was first training as a fellow, extraordinary measures like ECMO for complex heart cases were typically done with surgery," says Dr. Behfar. "Now they are less invasive and are becoming a key element to our practice. It's exciting to see how this technology has progressed to meet the needs of our patients."</p>



<p>Dr. Behfar credits the efforts of a multidisciplinary team for the success. This case was a collaboration with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/villavicencio-theoduloz-mauricio-a-m-d/bio-20507419?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mauricio Villavicencio Theoduloz, M.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dearani-joseph-a-m-d/bio-20053326?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Dearani, M.D.</a>, from surgery; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/yalamuri-suraj-m-m-d/bio-20341412?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suraj Yalamuri, M.D.</a>, from cardiac anesthesia; and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/miranda-william-r-m-d/bio-20435814?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William Miranda, M.D.</a>, from adult congenital heart disease, who helped guide this bridge to transplant procedure and manage the patient."</p>

<p>Travis has returned to his job in shipping and receiving at a farm, home and auto store in Iowa. He uses his second chance in life to enjoy hobbies like hunting, fishing and camping.</p>



<p>"I have way more energy, and I can do a lot more things," says Travis. "I have an exercise bike that I ride, and when the weather is good, I walk three miles a day."</p>

<p>Dr. Behfar's team continues to refine regenerative bridge to transplant procedures through research within the Mayo Clinic Van Cleve Cardiac Regenerative Medicine Program. The program also focuses on research to advance cellular and acellular therapies and tissue engineering, which supports the strategic goals of the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics and its objective of delivering new cures to the practice.</p>

<p>"Oh man, I can eat more now," says Juan. "Before I didn't want to eat anything because it would mess up my stomach and stuff because something wasn't working right."</p>



<p>That led Juan to his doctor's office where a series of tests revealed he had late-stage liver disease.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)</h2>



<p></p>



<p>"They told me I had liver cirrhosis," says Juan. "Nobody has ever told me that. They also said I needed a liver transplant, and quick."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487 ?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cirrhosis </a>is often caused by long-term, chronic use of alcohol. However, like in Juan's case, people who consume little, or even no alcohol, can develop cirrhosis. Many, like Juan, unknowingly live with a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can lead to a more severe, aggressive condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  In patients with NASH, the liver becomes inflamed and can progress to advanced scarring (cirrhosis) and liver failure. "I was never a big drinker," says Juan. "Maybe I would have a beer every once in a while. This came as such a surprise to me. I never expected this." </p>

<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the world. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/numerous-conditions-can-increase-risk-of-fatty-liver-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NAFLD</a> is a buildup of extra fat in the liver that is not caused by alcohol use. In the U.S. alone, approximately 75-100 million people, are affected by NAFLD, and rates are rising. Among those most impacted, according to experts, are people like Juan, who are Hispanic.</p>



<p>"We know that Hispanics have a genetic predisposition to develop fatty liver disease, specifically people from Mexico, compared to other countries from Latin America," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lizaola-mayo-blanca-c-m-d/bio-20510069 ?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Blanca Lizaola-Mayo</a>, medical director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818 ?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liver Transplant Center in Arizona</a>. "There is a report of 48% of the U.S. Hispanic population that has fatty liver disease, meaning that almost half of the Hispanics who live in the United States have metabolic syndrome and fatty liver disease, and many of them don't even know that they have it."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The silent disease</h2>



<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is referred to as a "silent disease" because often there are no symptoms. However, as the disease progresses, symptoms may include feeling weak, loss of appetite, and nausea. Juan admits to experiencing some of these symptoms but didn't think it was anything serious. "Sometimes I would feel tired and sleep a lot," says Juan. "I could only eat a little bit. Eventually, I just wasn't feeling myself anymore."</p>



<div class="wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-2 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-obesity-in-young-kids-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NAFLD is also on the rise among children</a>. It is currently the most common liver disease in children in the U.S., affecting an estimated 8 million children and adolescents. Risk factors include obesity, high cholesterol, insulin resistance, and high blood sugar levels. "We believe that this is related to the lack of exercise and physical activity," says Dr. Lizaola-Mayo. "We're seeing more kids watching TV, playing video games, instead of being outside playing. And also their diet is super important."</p>

<p>Juan ended up getting a liver transplant. Now he's feeling great. He and Gisela are sticking to a healthy diet, including lots of fruits and vegetables. Juan is grateful his disease was caught in time, and also for the donor who gave him the gift of life.</p>



<p>"I want to thank them. I am thankful that people <a href="https://www.dnaz.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donate</a>," says Juan. "I'm a donor, too. It would be great for people to accept and to donate their organs, and I want to thank the family for doing it."</p>

<p>The transplant center at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> has reached its 800<sup>th</sup> lung transplant since the program's inception in 2001. This milestone is part of a record-setting quarter that has seen <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lung-transplant/about/pac-20384754?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lung transplants</a> nearly double the number completed at the same time last year.</p>



<p>"As one of the leading medical centers in the world, Mayo Clinic prides itself on delivering excellent care and having patient well-being at the center of its care model," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/baz-maher-a-m-d/bio-20534599?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maher Baz, M.D.</a>, division chair of Lung Failure and Transplantation at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "Reaching 800 lung transplants reflects how our dedicated multidisciplinary team has consistently lived up to the Mayo model for more than 20 years. This year, we have been transplanting at a faster pace with excellent results."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How did it happen</h2>



<p>The milestone can be attributed to several factors, including outcomes from the Transforming Transplant initiative, aimed at creating new clinical options for patients with organ dysfunction and failure. The use of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/news/organ-perfusion-systems-a-boon-to-heart-and-lung-transplants/mac-20518585?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ex vivo lung perfusion</a> has given the transplant center the ability to use lungs that previously may not have been usable. Additionally, donor pool expanding allows the transplant center to get organs from farther away. The team also credits the increased volume of transplants to the ability to treat patients who need multi-organ transplants, such as lung-heart. An increase in community education on the benefits of organ donation also has contributed to the growing number of transplants performed so far this year.</p>



<p>"On behalf of our program and our patients, I would like to express our gratitude to the donors and their families who are an invaluable part of this milestone and saving lives," says Dr. Baz.</p>



<p>The transplant center anticipates reaching a record-setting 60 to 70 lung transplants in 2023. Comparatively, 37 lung transplants were completed by year-end 2022. Nationwide, nearly 1,000 people are currently waiting for a lung transplant.</p>

<p>For many American Indians and Alaska Natives, living on an Indian reservation provides a sense of pride, independence, and the ability to maintain cultural and social traditions important to their heritage.</p>



<p>Life on the Indian reservation can also mean high rates of poverty, lack of access to food, transportation, communication and health care. Complex medical procedures like an <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consider-organ-donation-during-donate-life-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organ transplant</a> can seem unattainable.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic in Arizona is working to change that.</p>



<p>A new patient outreach program is helping to connect American Indians and Alaska Natives with the lifesaving transplants they need. Marty Velasco Hames takes us to the Navajo Reservation in Northern Arizona where one man says the program helped save his life.</p>

<p>Miles off the paved road, in the rugged Northern Arizona desert near the banks of the Colorado River, sits the small Native American community of Leupp. The very first Navajo chapter on the Navajo Indian reservation. </p>



<p>Robert Monroe, his wife Jackie, and their children are one of a handful of families born and raised, and living on this on this land today. Like with many others who call this community home, they live with little means, far below the poverty line.</p>



<p>"You know money is tight. It is a limited income," says Jackie. "And now we have the two grandkids that we have to provide for."</p>

Doctors told him he needed <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/science-saturday-mayo-clinic-researchers-integrate-genomics-into-kidney-disease-diagnosis-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney dialysis</a> three days a week. The closest dialysis center was about an hour away from their home. They had a car, but the back-and-forth trips became costly. Jackie and the kids would make lollipops and frybread to sell and raise extra money for gas.</p>



<p>"It wasn't easy," says Robert. "A lot of times we hitchhiked to dialysis."</p>

<p>Then after several years, dialysis was not enough. Doctors told Robert he needed a kidney transplant to survive. </p>



<p>That's when <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silena Thomas</a> stepped in. Silena also grew up on the Navajo reservation facing similar struggles. She attended school on the reservation where she was able to learn English as well as Navajo. At home, her mother and grandmother only spoke Navajo so Silena often found herself translating for them.</p>

<p>"My mom had a second grade education, and just following her to stores and different places, she would struggle communicating with non Navajos," says Silena. "During doctor visits, she had a hard time understanding, medications, doctor's instructions. I really wanted to be that bridge for my mom and help her with those barriers with communicating with her health care providers." </p>

<p>Silena is now bridging the communication and cultural gaps for hundreds of other Native Americans. She works as a patient navigator in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant center at Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>. She helps coordinate care for American Indians and Alaska Natives in need of a lifesaving organ donation. Her goal is to help remove the fears her family faced. </p>



<p>"You come here and this is a huge facility, and being from a remote area surrounded by all your family, and you come here and all you see are white faces, and you know that is scary, and that is intimidating, and plus you don't understand what they're saying," says Silena. "Then they try to ask you questions, and that can be very intimidating."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="597" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/Silena-with-patient-1024x597.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-364756" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/Silena-with-patient-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/Silena-with-patient-300x175.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/Silena-with-patient-768x448.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/Silena-with-patient-1536x895.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/Silena-with-patient-2048x1194.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>Silena reached out to Robert when she found out he was scheduled for a kidney transplant at Mayo Clinic. In the weeks leading up to the transplant, Silena helped the family with transportation, lodging, insurance, medical appointments, and other details necessary before the transplant. Jackie says being able to talk to Silena in Navajo, and the cultural connection they shared made them feel at home.</p>



<p>"She was like part of us at Mayo Clinic because she knew Navajo," says Jackie. "We would speak and laugh with her in Navajo and we felt comfortable because she was like a sister."</p>



<p>Silena has been in her new role for about a year. She says she loves her work, and feels it is a tribute to her heritage and her family. "I know that my mom would be very proud that I am doing this," says Silena. "Being able to do what I did for her and my grandma, and now I can do that for other patients as well."</p>

<p>Robert's kidney transplant was a success. Fully recovered, he is back home on the land he loves, enjoying time with his family, and looking forward to a brighter future with gratitude for Silena and the donor who gave him the gift of life.</p>



<p>"The person who donated has a bigger heart than I do," says Robert. "Thank you for making me special again."</p>

<p>Heart failure continues to be an epidemic in the U.S. Despite efforts put into awareness and prevention, heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart transplant</a> is the gold standard to treat advanced heart failure. With more than 100,000 people on the transplant waiting list, Mayo Clinic is hoping to save more lives by adopting strategies for expanding the donor pool for heart transplants.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/0xAYdBFKMHk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: The Mayo Clinic Minute.</a></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/Mayo-Clinic-Minute-Saving-more-lives-by-expanding-the-donor-pool-CLEAN.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:10) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please "Courtesy: Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/SCRIPT-MCM-Expanding-the-donor-pool.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>On average, 17 people die each day waiting for a transplant, which is why expanding the donor pool has never been more important.</p>



<p>Traditionally, donor hearts were retrieved from patients who were declared brain dead, but their heart remained beating.</p>



<p>However, game-changing organ perfusion systems, such as "heart in a box," have allowed for increased use of donation after circulatory death, where the heart stops beating.</p>



<p>"Donors (from) circulatory death, their heart has stopped, there is a five-minute waiting period, a declaration of their death, and then we take the heart out and put it in a box and perfuse it over there," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/villavicencio-theoduloz-mauricio-a-m-d/bio-20507419?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mauricio Villavicencio</a>, a Mayo Clinic heart and lung transplant surgeon.</p>



<p>Once the heart is reanimated, the function of the organ is assessed for transplant. The system allows the organ to stay warm and metabolically active, extending the time between retrieval and transplant by several hours.</p>



<p>"We have had three, four, five, six hours of perfusion on the device," says Dr. Villavicencio. "If you have four hours, you could go essentially around all North America with that."</p>



<p>Something else that's helping to expand donor pools is the new generation of antivirals that allow for the safe transplantation of organs from hepatitis C-positive donors. A significant source of donor organs that, before, would have been discarded.</p>
