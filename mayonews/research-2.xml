<p>While the bacteria in the intestine are helpful for digesting food and fighting infections, they have long been suspected to play an essential role in triggering&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rheumatoid arthritis</a>. This chronic inflammatory disorder affects the joints.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a link between an abundance of specific gut bacteria and the triggering of an immune response against a person's tissue. They also found that this happens even before the clinical symptoms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rheumatoid arthritis</a>&nbsp;appear. They published their findings in a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37656793/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;in Science Advances.</p>



<p>"As we age, our gut bacteria and their byproducts change, which impacts our immune system," says senior author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/taneja-veena-ph-d/bio-00027247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Veena Taneja, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic immunologist. There is a known link between imbalances in gut bacteria, aging, and rheumatoid arthritis, but it is challenging to prove this connection in humans. "This research sheds light on the complex relationship between gut microbiota and rheumatoid arthritis."</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:34% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="600" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/MSS_0001342127.jpg-Veena-Taneja.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-374711 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/MSS_0001342127.jpg-Veena-Taneja.jpg 500w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/MSS_0001342127.jpg-Veena-Taneja-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p></p>



<p>Dr. Taneja explains that it is difficult to determine if gut microbiota is the cause of the disease in patients because an autoimmune response&nbsp;precedes the onset of clinical symptoms in patients by one to 10 years.</p>



<p>"The gut microbiome may hold the key to understanding healthy aging, how to avoid chronic diseases, and may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment," says Dr Taneja.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Using a preclinical model (experimenting in the lab and not on patients), the researchers determined that the gut bacteria&nbsp;<em>Eggerthella</em>&nbsp;<em>lenta</em>&nbsp;causes an autoimmune response before the onset of the clinical symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. In that response, the immune system produces autoantibodies that mistakenly target and attack the body's tissues and cells instead of foreign invaders, such as bacteria or viruses.</p>



<p>This same microbe also reduces amino acids such as arginine, citrulline and tryptophan metabolites to levels more similar to that of much older people, who see a gradual deterioration of their immune system due to aging.</p>



<p>In addition to their findings, researchers noted a connection between Eggerthella lenta and higher levels of these autoantibodies in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting the importance of considering gender-specific factors in the disease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Informing patient care</strong></h2>



<p>Rheumatoid arthritis has a genetic predisposition; however, many at risk may not know whether they are at risk for severe rheumatoid arthritis</p>



<p>This biomarker may help diagnose severe rheumatoid arthritis and assess its progression.</p>



<p>The research suggests that clinicians could use measurements of metabolic byproducts induced by these gut bacteria as a marker for the severity of the disease. In familial cases and people harboring rheumatoid arthritis-susceptible genes, the researchers say that sequencing bacteria, autoantibodies and metabolites — especially in healthy females — may help predict the likelihood of them developing rheumatoid arthritis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future directions</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers plan to work on how clinicians can use&nbsp;<em>Eggerthella lenta</em>&nbsp;in their diagnoses, especially in women. They will study whether targeting it using antibiotics or specific genes and metabolites can affect preclinical autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis. They are also exploring the link between&nbsp;<em>Eggerthella lenta</em>&nbsp;and its effect on aging.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disclosures</strong></h2>



<p>The technology has been patented in 11,634,744 "Methods and Materials for Assessing and Treating Arthritis." The patent holders have received no royalties.</p>

<p>"Physiologically, AugMAP can be considered a marker of global left ventricular contractile function," says Chieh-Ju Chao, M.D., senior associate consultant in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Department of Cardiovascular Medicine</a> and the study's first author. "AugMAP is easily calculated from the patient's blood pressure and mean aortic gradient, and we found that low AugMAP is associated with higher mortality in all moderate aortic stenosis patient subgroups."</p>



<p>Aortic stenosis is one of the most common cardiac valvular abnormalities, affecting about 5% of people older than 65 years. For most patients with moderate aortic stenosis, clinical guidelines call only for periodic monitoring with echocardiography, a test that uses sound waves to show how blood moves through the heart. However, growing evidence shows that patients with moderate aortic stenosis have poor longer-term survival rates and could benefit from earlier intervention.</p>



<p>The study looked at 4,563 patients with moderate aortic stenosis who were treated at Mayo Clinic from January 2010 through December 2020. The findings indicate that AugMAP is a better prognostic tool compared to other available measures and can detect early-stage left ventricular dysfunction before a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction is observed. "With this information, we can identify patients at higher risk of mortality with current management strategies and initiate discussion about other treatment strategies," says Dr. Chao.</p>



<p>"Moderate aortic stenosis does carry a higher risk of morbidity and mortality compared to the general population based on several prior studies," says senior author <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/arsanjani-reza-m-d/bio-20163932?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reza Arsanjani, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.&nbsp;"Current guidelines recommend active surveillance although earlier intervention might benefit select patients.&nbsp;Our study could potentially identify high-risk individuals who might benefit from earlier intervention."</p>



<p>The authors say future studies should consider whether patients with lower AugMAP can benefit from earlier intervention rather than periodic monitoring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A recent study based on real-world community patient data confirms the effectiveness of the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE), developed by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology in 2013. The PCE is used to estimate a person's 10-year risk of developing clogged arteries, also known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atherosclerosis</a>, and guide heart attack and stroke prevention efforts. Study findings are published in the <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.07.018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American College of Cardiology</a>.</p>



<p>The new study highlights to patients and clinicians the continued reliability and effectiveness of the PCE as a tool for assessing cardiovascular risk, regardless of statin use to lower cholesterol.</p>



<p>The PCE serves as a shared decision-making tool for a clinician and patient to evaluate their current status in preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The calculator considers input in the categories of gender, age, race, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for high blood pressure, diabetes status, and smoking status.</p>



<p>Using retrospective data from more than 30,000 patients enrolled in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/quantitative-health-sciences/divisions/epidemiology/research/rochester-epidemiology-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rochester Epidemiology Project</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers found the PCE performed well at the community level and with relative accuracy between sexes, across age groups and race. The use of statin medications to lower cholesterol did not change the value of the predictions, even though the PCE was developed before statins became widely available. The tool also retained its accuracy when using measurement factors, such as blood pressure, age and cholesterol levels, that were outside the original risk profile range.</p>



<p>"We have seen the excellent performance of the Pooled Cohort Equation over the years in clinical practice," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-b-a/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study. "The study shows that this tool is reliable, not only in light of new cholesterol-lowering drugs, but for patients who previously were not evaluated with the PCE because maybe their blood pressure was higher or lower than the standards, or they did not fit the age profile, for example. By including patients with values outside the accepted range, I think we can calculate the risk for heart attacks in another 20% to 25% of patients, which is not small."<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>

<p>Lifestyle modification is essentially the mainstay of cardiovascular disease prevention, and clinicians talk with patients about what to focus on to prevent the serious consequences of a heart attack or stroke.</p>



<p>"Beyond wellness questions about exercise, diet, stress level and good sleep, the PCE guides the conversation to decide if it's time to talk about starting treatment for high cholesterol or hypertension. With this study, we wanted to provide confidence that the Pooled Cohort Equation still performs well at the community level, and our data supports that," says Jose Medina-Inojosa, M.D., a research scientist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Statins are medications that reduce the amount of cholesterol made by the liver.</p>



<p>"Cholesterol builds within plaques that accumulate and grow inside the arteries, sometimes to the point that those arteries will be blocked," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenz.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>And blocked arteries can lead to coronary heart disease. But are statins for everyone?&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The patients that will benefit from taking statins the most will be individuals with history of heart attacks, strokes and other conditions known to be caused by cholesterol plaques," he says.</p>



<p>Diet also plays an important role. Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says to eat less processed meat and more grains, fruits and vegetables.</p>



<p>"The most impactful changes people can make to lower cholesterol will include consuming less animal products other than fish, consuming less saturated fat," he says.</p>



<p>And if your healthcare team recommends medication as well as lifestyle changes?</p>



<p>"Take those medications, check your numbers, be sure that all those factors are well under control,” says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>When Tanner Bommersbach, M.D., and a team of Mayo Clinic researchers analyzed national records of pediatric emergency department visits, they provided essential data to describe the growing national crisis in pediatric mental health.</p>



<p>Their study found that from 2011 to 2020, youth visits to emergency departments for mental health reasons&nbsp;<em>doubled</em>, while the proportion of visits for suicide-related symptoms increased&nbsp;<em>fivefold</em>.</p>



<p>The team's findings were recently published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2804326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Bommersbach, a child and adolescent psychiatry fellow, hopes the study's results will be useful in national conversations about youth mental health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking on a serious problem</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/Bommersbach-Tanner-J._15901441_20220701-240x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-374697" style="width:265px;height:331px" width="265" height="331" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tanner Bommersbach, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Bommersbach has had a longstanding interest in children's mental health. During high school and college, he worked in a North Dakota group home for children with developmental disabilities where he observed their interactions with their psychiatrists. The experience prompted him to pursue a career as a physician. He attended&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine</a>&nbsp;where he found a mentor in psychiatrist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/bostwick-j-michael-m-d-mfa/bio-00027634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J. Michael Bostwick, M.D</a>. Working with Dr. Bostwick during medical school, Dr. Bommersbach became interested in research and took part in studies investigating how people with suicidal symptoms interact with the healthcare system.</p>



<p></p>



<p>After pursuing a master's in public health to learn more about research methodology and completing his residency, Dr. Bommersbach returned to Mayo for fellowship training, where he has continued to conduct research on suicide prevention and epidemiology in pediatric mental health. He was recently first author on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00071-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another study</a>&nbsp;about rising rates of suicidal behaviors and unmet treatment needs among U.S. adults who experience a major depressive episode.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rising rates of illness</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Bommersbach says the study of pediatric emergency room visits expanded upon other studies that have shown rising rates of youth mental health concerns — but the magnitude of the rise in pediatric mental health visits, especially those that were suicide-related, took him by surprise.</p>



<p>The study used data from 2011 to 2020 from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, an annual cross-sectional national probability sample survey of emergency departments. The research team examined mental health-related visits for patients aged 6 to 24 years. Data showed a significant rise in visits across all age groups, sexes, races and ethnicities. But the greatest increase was for patients aged 10 to 14 years.</p>



<p>Even though data were not yet available from 2021 or 2022, the findings did include some data from early in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:29% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/McKean-Alastair-J.-MD_15241271_201406250921-250x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-374698 size-full" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>"Over the last few decades, we've seen an increase in youth mental health issues. COVID likely accelerated and exacerbated these concerns," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mckean-alastair-j-m-d/bio-20149218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alastair McKean, M.D.</a>, a co-author of the JAMA study.</p>
</div></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prompting change</strong></h2>



<p>The findings of the study do not identify why children's mental health visits increased so dramatically, but the authors point to several potential contributing factors, including increased awareness of mental health concerns among youth, improved and increased referrals from doctors, greater willingness among young people to seek help and reduced access to other mental health services in the community.</p>



<p>Of particular concern is the increase in suicide-related symptoms in young people, which increased in all age groups, across sex, race and ethnicity, insurance type and geographic region. The authors point out that suicide-related visits among adolescents accounted for 6.6% of all ED visits in 2019-2020.</p>



<p>The numbers are a call to action, they say.</p>



<p>"The first part of prompting change is having real data, and this study shows that this is a growing national crisis," says Dr. McKean.</p>



<p>"One area that needs to be addressed in a national conversation is increasing access to non-hospital services that can treat mental health issues. Emergency departments frequently act as safety nets for individuals with unmet health needs, especially for uninsured and undocumented children," says Dr. Bommersbach. "My goal is to continue research that will illuminate these national gaps so that we can move toward a national commitment to mental healthcare and expanded community-based services for young people."</p>

<p>As a pulmonologist and genomic scientist,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ortega-victor-e-m-d-ph-d/bio-20520652" target="_blank">Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is leading a charge to breathe new life into precision medicine advancements. His mission is rooted in a deep commitment to health equities and inspired by his grandmother.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"My grandmother died of asthma, and that should not have happened. She was Puerto Rican like me, and Puerto Ricans have the highest severity and frequency of asthma of any ethnic group in the world," Dr. Ortega says. "They also represent less than 1% of people in genetic studies. So, I've made it a life mission to develop cures and diagnostics for people like my grandma, and for all people."&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Predicting disease risks: Polygenic Risk Scores</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/Ortega-Victor-E._14023334_202109070736-250x300-1.jpg" alt="Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D." class="wp-image-374446" style="width:193px;height:231px" width="193" height="231" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em><sub>Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D.</sub></em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In his new role as the associate director for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a>&nbsp;in Arizona, Dr. Ortega is guiding his team toward a transformative future of healthcare, where each person's unique DNA profile may serve as a personalized guide to their health and well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Imagine knowing your genetic predisposition for having a heart attack in your 50s, or if you're in the top 5% of the population for the risk of cancer or diabetes. With this knowledge, you could make informed lifestyle choices and receive screenings to mitigate that risk," Dr. Ortega says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously inconceivable, he says personalized health forecasts, derived from so-called polygenic risk scores, are possible because of new and sophisticated genome sequencing technologies. The complex scores are compiled from a combination of data from thousands of a person's DNA variants. The data has the potential to predict disease risks, such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and specific cancers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ortega says getting to the point where all people know their polygenic risk scores will require a solid foundation of "omics" research and datasets, cutting-edge technologies and further discoveries of gene-disease links — all of which are within his team's expertise and capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Omics is an emerging multidisciplinary field of biological sciences that encompasses genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and more. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's going to take considerable work and planning, but it really is the way of the future,"&nbsp;he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advancing omics beyond research labs</strong></h3>



<p>In the shorter term, Dr. Ortega plans to transition more omics discoveries from research labs to the clinic. Omics data can help identify the molecular culprits driving a person's disease, as well as biomarkers that can lead to the development of targeted treatments and diagnostics.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Expanding genomic testing across diseases</strong></h3>



<p>Drawing from his years of extensive clinical experience in treating patients with severe respiratory illnesses, Dr. Ortega is also working to expand genomic testing to a broader set of diseases. He highlights the center's collaborative Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases as an effective model that he hopes to amplify. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases proactively engages healthcare teams across Mayo's clinical practice to conduct&nbsp;targeted genomic testing for patients with a suspected rare genetic disease. He says expanding this strategy to more diseases will help build collaborations across Mayo and educate more clinicians on genomics. It may also ensure the most effective genomic sequencing tests are given to patients, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He points to cystic fibrosis, a genetic respiratory disorder, as an example of how genetic misconceptions and wrong testing strategies can negatively affect diverse populations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"Clinicians might overlook genetic tests for cystic fibrosis in minority groups because of a misconception that cystic fibrosis is most prevalent in people of European white ancestry," he says. "However, the disease can affect various ethnic populations with distinct variants, so they also may order the wrong test." &nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clearing the path to cutting-edge medicine for all</strong></h3>



<p>Dr. Ortega emphasizes the importance of collaborations and data sharing to accelerate medical discoveries and improve health equity. His dedication to collaborations extends beyond the walls of Mayo Clinic to other consortiums that share profound commitments to enhancing diversity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The future of healthcare is happening right now," Dr. Ortega says. "But it's much bigger than genomics advancements and innovations. It's about making sure cutting-edge medicine is accessible to every person." </p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Researchers from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/education/gerstner-family-career-development-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a> have discovered new genetic markers to identify Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancer with high accuracy. Studies are underway to determine if these genetic markers are in stool samples and, if so, how this could lead to a non-invasive screening option for patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome.</a> Their research was published in <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/doi/10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-23-0107/729134/Methylated-DNA-Markers-for-Sporadic-Colorectal-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer Prevention Research</a>, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.</p>



<p>"This is an exciting finding that brings us closer to the reality that clinicians may soon be able to offer a non-invasive cancer screening option to patients with the highest risk of getting cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/samadder-niloy-jewel-jewel-j-m-d/bio-20415667?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jewel Samadder, M.D.</a>, co-lead author of the paper and gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "I look forward to the day when I no longer have to remind patients with Lynch Syndrome to schedule their annual colonoscopy and complete the prep, when they will instead be able to provide a stool sample to screen for cancer."</p>



<p>Lynch syndrome is an inherited genetic condition that significantly increases the risk of multiple cancers, most notably colorectal and uterine cancers. Approximately 1 in 300 people have Lynch syndrome, many of whom are unaware of it. Patients with Lynch syndrome undergo <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopies</a> annually to detect and remove pre-cancerous lesions that can form colorectal cancer, in addition to undergoing invasive tests or prophylactic surgery to prevent uterine cancer.</p>



<p>For this study, the researchers evaluated a panel of methylated DNA markers (MDM) for sporadic colorectal and endometrial cancers in people with Lynch syndrome (LS). Sporadic cancer is cancer that occurs randomly in people with no family history or known predisposing risk factors. The researchers also included control groups with no cancer. For colorectal cancer, there were 23 LS cases, 48 sporadic cases, 32 LS controls, and 48 sporadic controls. For endometrial cancer, there were 30 LS cases, 48 sporadic cases, 29 LS controls and 37 sporadic controls.</p>



<p>"We found that a marker panel composed of three biomarkers (LASS4, LRRC4, PPP2R5C) could effectively differentiate Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancer from Lynch syndrome controls, with 92% accuracy. This three-marker panel also performed similarly in distinguishing sporadic colorectal cancer cases from controls," says Dr. Samadder. This three-marker panel is being tested in a multi-site clinical trial in patients with Lynch syndrome as a non-invasive screening option.</p>



<p>"Our findings support the feasibility of cancer detection in stool and lower gynecologic genital tract samples in the setting of Lynch syndrome and warrant further testing," says Dr. Samadder.</p>

<p>Nearly 200,000 people in the U.S. are affected. Most are over the age of 50. The disease is more common in Rochester, Minnesota, than other locations due to the area's large resident populations of Northern European or Scandinavian descent, which may be genetically predisposed to GCA.</p>

Weyand, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Associate Consultant in Rheumatology and Immunology, and Professor of Immunology and Medicine, in her research lab.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Over the last three decades, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/weyand-cornelia-m-m-d-ph-d/bio-20527870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cornelia Weyand, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo rheumatologist and clinician-scientist, has been building on the work of her predecessors to investigate the source of the disease. Her work has illuminated the immune system's role in the inflammatory process and paved the way for potential new therapies. These insights may also lead to immune therapies that treat more common diseases, including cancer.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Surprising from the start</strong></h2>



<p>Bayard Horton, M.D., Thomas Magath, M.D., Ph.D., and George Brown, M.D., first observed the symptoms of GCA — including bulging arteries at the temples — in two different patients and were among the first in the world to perform temporal artery biopsies,&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/539500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing their findings in 1934</a>. They also were among the first to classify the condition as a&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-vasculitis-affects-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vasculitis</a>, but they didn’t have an explanation for how the disease worked.</p>



<p>A physician in England, J. R. Gilmour, M.B., C.M., renamed the disease giant cell arteritis due to the enlarged cells he observed in 1941. But a significant breakthrough did not come until a decade later when in 1950, Mayo Clinic physicians&nbsp;<a href="https://libraryguides.mayo.edu/historicalunit/cortisone#:~:text=In%201950%2C%20Mayo%20Clinic%20doctors,of%20cortisone%20to%20rheumatoid%20arthritis." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Edward Kendall, Ph.D., and Philip Hench, M.D.</a>, received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of cortisone. Because cortisone suppresses inflammation, it became one of the primary treatments for GCA. However, the treatment doesn't get to the source of the condition.</p>



<p>From early on, scientists were surprised to find that GCA involves the immune system. Blood vessels, critical to the body's function, tend to evade the inflammatory and damaging processes of immune cells, a characteristic that researchers refer to as "immune privilege." However, GCA targets the blood vessels, including the aorta, the largest artery in the body.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking a closer look</strong></h2>



<p>Nearly a decade passed before another Mayo physician looked at the disease more closely. "When I started, no one was interested in giant cell arteritis," says Gene Hunder, M.D., a rheumatologist and emeritus physician at Mayo.</p>



<p>He says GCA was not on physicians' radar simply because the disease had not been well defined. "If you know about something, you see it in a patient and make a note of it. If you aren't aware of it, you let it go by. I think that was what was happening with giant cell arteritis for many years," Dr. Hunder says.</p>



<p>He recalls seeing a patient at Mayo in the mid-1960s who presented with a barely palpable pulse and was diagnosed with inflammation of the aorta. He and a resident examined the case in detail. Then, they delved into the medical files to find records of several patients with low pulses in their arms or neck but no further diagnoses. They conducted an epidemiologic study, which provided evidence that patients with GCA frequently also had inflamed aortas.</p>



<p>The finding attracted the attention of the medical world. "I think the fact that the aorta was involved struck the doctors harder because that's a big blood vessel and could have disastrous side effects," Dr. Hunder says.</p>



<p>It's known that GCA is more prevalent in women than men, but no one can predict who will get it. The frontline treatment — the corticosteroid prednisone — is the same approach as half a century ago but relieves symptoms only temporarily. "In vasculitis, it's not unusual for some symptoms to go away, but the inflammation in the arteries will go on. The activity of the disease declines with the corticosteroid therapy, but there is still inflammation in the blood vessel," Dr. Hunder says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Picking up the thread</strong></h2>



<p>In 1990, Dr. Weyand joined Mayo Clinic and soon saw the scientific opportunity to diagnose and treat many patients with GCA in Minnesota and to study the disease.</p>



<p>A few years ago, she and her colleagues identified a problem with a protein that seemed to cause the immune system to go haywire in patients with GCA. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A typical immune system responds to antigens, or toxins, that cause infection or are derived from cancerous cells. While immune protection against infection and cancer is a high priority, the immune system also needs built-in brakes, or immune checkpoints, that tell the immune system to stop and prevent it from over-responding. Dr. Weyand and colleagues, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goronzy-jorg-m-d-ph-d/bio-20527076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jörg J Goronzy, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, found that the protein PD-L1 is weakly expressed in patients with GCA, preventing the delivery of a stop signal to T cells. This finding led the team to conclude that patients with GCA have a broken immune checkpoint, which explains an overabundance of inflammation.</p>



<p>"That became a landmark <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28115719/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> because it was the first report of human autoimmune disease linked to a nonfunctional [immune] checkpoint," she says.</p>



<p>Recently, her research team made another discovery, furthering the understanding of an immune system gone awry. They found a second immune checkpoint that is not working in GCA. They saw that a specific ligand, a molecule that binds to and activates a receptor on immune cells, gets trapped and can't make it to the surface of the immune cell to signal the immune system to stop. When the ligand, called CD155, gets trapped, it triggers the unrestricted proliferation of T cells. The T cells invade and accumulate in blood vessel walls. There, they secrete the cytokine interleukin-9, which further attacks and damages the blood vessel.</p>



<p>"We now have seen a second checkpoint that is not working. So, this seems to be the reason why these patients are driving inflammatory responses in the aorta where they are not supposed to be," Dr. Weyand says.</p>



<p>That&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/pdfExtended/S2666-3791(23)00122-2">study showed</a>&nbsp;the immune cells lacking the CD155 ligands also can be detected in blood and GCA lesions and therefore are new biomarkers of the disease that may help improve diagnosis.</p>



<p>What's more, the researchers have shown in another <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37672564/">recent paper</a> that the structure of the blood vessel tissues itself shelters and fosters the disease-inducing immune cells in GCA. This provides even more information for potential GCA therapies.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advancing immunology has relevance to cancer too</strong></h2>



<p>These advances in the immunology of GCA have relevance to cancer, too, Dr. Weyand points out. Increasingly, immune therapies that enhance a person's own immune response are being used to treat various forms of cancer.</p>



<p>Patients with cancer are on the opposite end of the spectrum from patients with vasculitis in that their immune checkpoints, or brakes, work too well to stop immune response, and tumors take advantage of that. As a result, oncologists prescribe immune checkpoint inhibitors to unleash patients' immune systems to fight cancer cells and tumors.</p>



<p>Ultimately, knowing how to target faulty immune checkpoints opens the opportunity to identify new GCA treatments. Dr. Weyand's team has developed a preclinical model outfitted with human arteries and a human immune system called an immune avatar. The model system enables researchers to study GCA more closely, monitor inflammation and test immunotherapies to suppress inflammation.</p>



<p>"That immune avatar has been a dimensional step forward for us," she says. "This research changes our fundamental understanding of the pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis and paves the way for an entirely new approach for treatment."</p>



<p>Dr. Weyand's research has received support from the National Institutes of Health, Stanford University and Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have identified risk factors that can cause adult <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a> patients to suffer symptoms that linger for months or years. The condition is often referred to as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-haul COVID</a>. The findings are reported in the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10815589231190560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Investigative Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers surveyed more than 3,000 adults over the age of 18 who were treated via Mayo Clinic's virtual COVID-19 clinics in Florida, Arizona and Minnesota between March 2020 and March 2021. They reviewed the patients' symptoms, the incidence of long-haul COVID in the group and how many were hospitalized due to COVID-19. The patients were also asked to rate their perception of the severity of their symptoms, whether they received a diagnosis of long-haul COVID, how long it took for them to resume their usual activities, and how much time they missed from work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Study Findings</h2>



<p>"We found that patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms were more likely to have long-haul COVID than those who had mild symptoms," says Bala Munipalli, M.D., an internist at Mayo Clinic in Florida and co-senior author of the study. "A majority of these were women who had been hospitalized, suffered from psychological impacts from COVID-19 such as anxiety and depression, and required more than one month to return to their normal activities after the illness."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/Munipalli_Bala_21559457_201911070239.jpg" alt="Dr. Bala Munipalli" class="wp-image-374245" style="width:301px;height:361px" width="301" height="361" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/Munipalli_Bala_21559457_201911070239.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/Munipalli_Bala_21559457_201911070239-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Bala Munipalli</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The average age of the respondents in the study was 54 and most were women, including 57% of the patients surveyed who reported severe symptoms; 60% with mild symptoms; and 65% with moderate symptoms. Most patients (92%) with mild symptoms were able to resume their usual schedules within four weeks after COVID-19 infection, but 23% of these patients with mild acute infection developed long-haul COVID. Significantly more (37.4%) patients with severe symptoms were hospitalized than those with mild (0.9%) or moderate symptoms (4.8%). Hospitalized patients also reported having persistent symptoms of long-haul COVID (67%), needing a month or more to resume their usual activities, missing work for at least three weeks, and having negative psychological side effects.</p>



<p>Most respondents in the study reported long-haul COVID symptoms that lasted three to six months, with those symptoms ranging in severity. The most common symptoms in the study group were fatigue, loss of smell, altered taste, shortness of breath and poor sleep.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">More to learn</h2>



<p>"The inability to resume normal activities within one month after acute COVID-19 may be a predictive factor for long-haul COVID. As we continue to study this disease, we hope to gain a better understanding of who is susceptible to it, the symptoms that remain persistent, and how to best manage these patients in the early course of their illness," says Dr. Munipalli. "Additional studies may help guide the standardization of future assessment tools to evaluate impairment and also provide valuable information to employers, educators, policymakers and patients."</p>



<p>The researchers note that a multidisciplinary approach to long-haul COVID is needed and that healthcare personnel should recognize key symptoms, obtain a careful medical history and physical examination, as well as pay close attention to comorbid medical conditions in patients with persistent symptoms.</p>



<p>Dr. Munipalli says her team plans additional research focusing on treatments for long-haul COVID.</p>
