<p>Up to 10% of newborns are born with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tongue-tie/symptoms-causes/syc-20378452?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ankyloglossia</a>, a condition more commonly known as tongue-tie. The most common symptom for infants is difficulty with breastfeeding or bottlefeeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics is <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-067605/198022/Identification-and-Management-of-Ankyloglossia-and?autologincheck=redirected">raising concerns</a> about the increasing use of surgeries, using scissors or lasers, to treat infants with tongue-tie, when research suggests these surgical treatments may not be necessary.</p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, Rebekah Huppert, nurse and lactation consultant at Mayo Clinic, discusses how latching and feeding challenges caused by tongue-tie can be addressed with or without the need for any procedure.</p>

<p>Latching and feeding challenges can be caused by a number of issues. Tongue-tie sometimes can be to blame.</p>



<p>"Typically, the things that we see the tongue causing problems with are going to be the latch. Primarily, it's difficult for baby to get a hold of the nipple and pull it into the soft palate," says Huppert.</p>



<p>With tongue-tie, an unusually short, thick or tight band of tissue tethers the bottom of the tongue's tip to the floor of the mouth, restricting the tongue's range of motion.</p>



<p>"The band of tissue is something that we can look for, but sometimes you can see it and the tongue moves great. And sometimes it's not super obvious and the tongue doesn't move well. So although that can be an indicator, it isn't the diagnosis just because it's there," says Huppert.</p>



<p>Some cases may require a simple surgical procedure for correction. But not all babies with tongue-tie require treatment. Some families and care providers choose a wait-and-see approach. In that case, Huppert suggests working with a lactation professional who can provide some strategies.</p>



<p>"We can work on different positionings with latch. One of the primary things that we like to do is what we call the laid-back position, where we have moms kind of laying back on their back. That's thought to have gravity bring that chin and tongue forward a little bit more."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Cardiologists in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/heart-rhythm-clinic/overview/ovc-20442477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart Rhythm Clinic</a> are using a new innovative energy source to safely and successfully treat a common type of heart arrhythmia. The therapy, called pulsed field ablation (PFA), has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and represents a significant milestone in treating <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a> (AFib).</p>



<p>The irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm of AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart, increasing a patient's risk of stroke. Clinicians can use medication and therapies to help reset the heart rhythm, but some patients have AFib that persists and worsens. Ablation therapy has been used for about two decades to treat these patients, but pulsed field ablation uses a different approach.</p>



<p>Instead of applying heat or cold energy as in traditional ablation, the PFA catheter therapy uses short bursts of high energy called irreversible electroporation to affect heart tissue that causes atrial fibrillation. The PFA therapy successfully transitioned to patient care at Mayo Clinic in Rochester in February 2024. Mayo cardiac specialists have since used PFA to treat more than 200 patients for AFib.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Limitations inspired development of new energy sources</h2>



<p>"The traditional approaches using thermal energy sources to treat AFib — radiofrequency, laser, cryo energy — all carry an associated injury risk to nearby structures, the esophagus and the phrenic nerve," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kapa-suraj-m-d/bio-20055752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suraj Kapa, M.D.</a>, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PFA technology has been in development for more than 18 years. Mayo Clinic's pioneering research in ablative therapy began under another cardiac electrophysiologist and prolific inventor, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/asirvatham-samuel-j-m-d/bio-20053066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel J. Asirvatham, M.D.</a> He had a growing interest in developing novel energy sources that would allow for cardiac-selective impact.</p>



<p>"The principle underlying PFA is that, depending on the makeup of the cell membranes of different types of tissues, certain tissue may have different energy thresholds that may be 'deadened' or ablated while other tissue types may be preserved," says Dr. Kapa. "Research through hundreds of preclinical trials has suggested that PFA of the heart tissue can allow for a heart tissue-specific approach to ablation while avoiding collateral injury to structures such as the esophagus or the phrenic nerve."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research led to the development of two recently U.S.-approved systems to deliver pulsed field energy to the heart. Dr. Kapa notes that both catheters are approved to treat AFib in the form of pulmonary vein isolation and have shown similar efficacy in clinical trials when compared with traditional radiofrequency ablation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of pulsed field ablation</h2>



<p>PFA can lead to faster procedures while reducing anesthesia time and removing some of the risks of traditional AFib ablation.</p>



<p>"Minimizing risk and making potentially effective treatments more broadly available is critical to providing therapy to the largest number of patients," says Dr. Kapa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is estimated that 12.1 million people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AFib by 2030 — more than double the number in 2010. Globally, the number of patients diagnosed with AFib is increasing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"A growing body of evidence supports more aggressive rhythm control with ablation, whether earlier in a patient's AFib diagnosis to achieve better long-term outcomes or in the setting of other comorbidities such as heart failure, in which ablation has shown to reduce mortality," says Dr. Kapa.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Assessing how PFA may be used for other arrhythmias, such as ventricular arrhythmias, is in the works. Early preclinical data suggest that PFA may be superior to current traditional thermal energy-based approaches in this arena. Looking ahead, Dr. Kapa anticipates rapid growth and evolution in pulsed field therapy.</p>



<p>"Within the next year, we expect the introduction of at least a half dozen catheters and systems utilizing pulsed field therapy, each offering new research opportunities and the potential to provide transformative, curative care for patients with arrhythmic diseases."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Bracamonte advises keeping an eye on air quality measures in your area. "If certain levels are high, it's recommended that you stay indoors," he says. "Try to close up windows as much as possible. Try to make sure you have a central air conditioning system so that the air is circulated in your home appropriately"</p>



<p>He says in some instances where the air quality is poor, you're at high risk and must go outdoors, you might consider the use of a respirator to avoid underlying lung injury.</p>

<p>Processed, and especially ultra-processed, foods have been blamed for the national rise in obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. But what exactly are these foods, and are they really all that bad for you?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Defining processed foods</h2>



<p>According to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome" target="_blank">Department of Agriculture</a>, processed foods are any raw agricultural commodities altered from their original state. This includes washing, cleaning, milling, cutting, chopping, heating, pasteurizing, blanching, cooking, canning, freezing, drying, dehydrating, mixing or packaging.</p>



<p>While processing includes basic steps like washing, foods cross into ultra-processed territory when they contain preservatives, flavorings and other food additives, or substances approved for use in food products, such as salt, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-consuming-too-much-sugar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sugars</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/fast-facts-on-fats-and-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fats</a> used to enhance flavor and increase shelf life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ranking foods from minimally to ultra-processed</h2>



<p>Here's how the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eatright.org/" target="_blank">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a>&nbsp;ranks processed foods from minimally to mostly or ultra-processed:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Minimally processed foods, such as fresh blueberries, cut vegetables and roasted nuts, prepped for convenience.</li>



<li>Foods processed at their peak to lock in nutritional quality and freshness including canned tomatoes, tuna, frozen fruit or vegetables.</li>



<li>Foods with ingredients added for flavor and texture, such as sweeteners, spices, oils, colors and preservatives, include jarred pasta sauce, salad dressing, yogurt and cake mixes.</li>



<li>Ready-to-eat foods like crackers, chips and deli meat, which are more heavily processed.</li>



<li>The most heavily or ultra-processed foods include sweetened breakfast cereals, soda, energy drinks, artificially flavored crackers and potato chips, chicken nuggets and hot dogs.</li>
</ul>



<p>Minimally processed foods have a place in healthy diets. For example, low-fat milk, whole-grain or wheat bread, precut vegetables and fresh-cut greens are considered processed foods. Dairy- and plant-based milks and juices may be fortified with vitamin D and calcium, while breakfast cereals may have added fiber. Canned fruits packed in water or natural fruit juice can be part of a healthy diet when fresh fruit isn't readily available.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reading the labels</h2>



<p>When choosing foods, do some investigative work by examining ingredient lists and analyzing the nutrition facts labels:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Avoid foods that contain additives and preservatives, such as high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, food dyes, monosodium glutamate, sodium nitrates, sodium nitrites and sulfites such as sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite or sodium sulfite.</li>



<li>Cut back on ultra-processed foods and purchase more unprocessed or minimally processed foods.</li>



<li>Look for more natural ingredients.</li>
</ul>



<p>When reading the nutrition facts labels, watch for hidden sugars, fats and salt, especially those added during processing.</p>



<p>Most labels now include <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-not-so-sweet-truth-of-added-sugars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added sugars</a>. The <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a> recommends that people older than 2 get less than 10% of total calories from added sugars, or about 200 calories in a 2,000-calorie diet. Children younger than 2 shouldn't have any added sugars in their diets. Learn to spot words like maltose, brown sugar, corn syrup, honey and fruit juice concentrate.</p>



<p>When it comes to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/kids-and-sodium-serious-risks-and-alarming-realities">sodium</a>, people often comment that they salt their food. As it turns out, you don't need to because manufacturers have already added salt for you, and it's often too much. The Dietary Guidelines also recommends adults consume less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day. Look for low- or reduced-sodium foods. Also try rinsing canned vegetables with water to remove some of the salt.</p>



<p>When checking fat content on labels, scan for saturated fats and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114" target="_blank">trans fats</a>. Choose foods lower in saturated fats. Trans fats are considered one of the worst types of fat because they can raise your low-density lipoprotein (LDL or "bad") cholesterol and lower your high-density lipoprotein (HDL or "good") cholesterol.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Taking baby steps toward healthier eating</h2>



<p>Take baby steps by making one dietary change at a time. Consider healthy swaps, such as whole-grain cereal with no added sugar instead of highly processed, sugary cereals. Choose whole-grain, high-fiber breads over white bread products. When looking for a healthy snack, reach for fresh fruit or vegetables instead of crackers, potato chips or processed cookies.</p>



<p>The key to healthy eating starts with you. Educate yourself on what to look for and talk with your healthcare professional or nutrition expert to discuss a food plan that works best for you.</p>

<p>Eastern Caribbean or Western Caribbean, lounging on the ship or island hopping, Julie Pulmano's love language is "any vacation on a boat." The 60-year-old nurse has been on more than two dozen cruises in her life — including the one where she met her husband, Sherman.</p>



<p>Of all the cruises she's taken, though, one stands out in Julie's mind.</p>



<p>"I was going up the stairs on a ship, and I was having chest pain and was short of breath," she says. "My husband said to me, 'You really need to go to the doctor. You promised me 90 years together.' That was a promise we made to each other, that we'd be married for 90-plus years. I didn't want to let him or our kids down. I went and had my heart checked out. It wasn't my heart, though. It was my weight."</p>



<p>Julie wasn't surprised by the news. She'd always battled her weight.</p>



<p>"I was that person who would be getting ready to go somewhere and I'd be in the closet, trying to find something that would fit," she says. "But nothing looked good on me, so I wouldn’t go. I'd tell my husband that I wasn't going and would just cry in the closet instead.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="204" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Before-204x300.png" alt="Julie Pulmano sitting on a scooter before her bariatric surgery" class="wp-image-392049" style="width:188px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Before-204x300.png 204w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Before.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Julie Pulmano before her bariatric surgery</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"I'd plan amazing cruises for six months out and buy cute outfits and start trying to lose weight, but I'd never lose it, and I'd be so sad. I'd go buy big-girl clothes instead and still go on the cruise, but the whole time I'd be so jealous of all the thin people around me. So, I'd promise myself that, next time, I was going to be one of those thin people. But then I'd book another cruise, and the same pattern would just repeat every year."</p>



<p>It took learning her weight was harming her health — and could potentially shorten her life — to encourage Julie to take additional action.</p>



<p>"That was what made me realize I needed to do something," she says. "I've never looked back."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Turning to Mayo Clinic</h2>



<p>At the time, Julie was working as a nurse on the surgical floor of Mayo Clinic. Mayo had opened its <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/bariatric-center-florida/sections/overview/ovc-20523458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric Center in Florida</a> in 2007, and ever since, Julie had been struck by the success stories she heard from patients who'd gone through the program.</p>



<p>In 2012, Julie entered the program as a candidate for weight-loss surgery. While Sherman and her kids supported her, Julie felt judged by other family members and friends, and she left the program.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bowers-steven-m-d/bio-20055099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Steven Bowers</a>, a surgeon in the Bariatric Center, says the response Julie received isn't uncommon. "Some people may view surgery as extreme," he says. "But they're often not thinking about the long-term toll obesity has on health. They also may not recognize that if you have a lot of weight to lose, you're unlikely to get there through diet alone."</p>



<p>In 2014, Julie realized she needed help if she was going to meet her weight-loss goals. She reentered the program, determined to complete it successfully this time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Second time's the charm</h2>



<p>The Bariatric Center at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> offers surgical and non surgical options for patients. To be cleared for bariatric surgery, patients must undergo certain evaluations, including blood and imaging tests, as well as behavioral, heart and lung assessments to reduce the risk of complications.</p>



<p>"I went through the evaluations," Julie says. "I met with the dietitians and nurses. I met with the bariatrician, who determined I was a great candidate for surgery. And I went to the classes to learn how to eat properly and exercise. Everyone in the program was wonderful."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="227" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/After-227x300.png" alt="Julie Pulmano standing on a staircase following bariatric surgery" class="wp-image-392050" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/After-227x300.png 227w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/After.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Julie Pulmano following bariatric surgery</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Julie credits the lifestyle changes she learned before her gastric bypass surgery with the outcome she achieved afterward — losing 125 pounds and keeping it off for 10 years and counting. The behavior modifications she maintains, like focusing on portion size, not plate size, and learning how to meal prep, have been the most important factor, she says.</p>



<p>"Buying into the behavior aspects of the program is what leads to success with bariatric surgery," says Dr. Bowers, who was Julie's surgeon. "Julie is a great example of someone who took to heart the importance of changing your diet and changing your lifestyle, and she's done extremely well."</p>



<p>Although Julie acknowledges she's biased because she works for Mayo Clinic, she says she'll never go anywhere else for her health.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic has the highest standards," Julie says. "They're so comprehensive. They truly walk alongside you, from start to finish."</p>



<p>In addition to the help and encouragement Julie received from the bariatric program team, she also drew inspiration and motivation from her peers through the program's support groups.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A (role) model nurse</h2>



<p>In May 2023, Julie switched roles, moving from the surgical floor to work as a nurse in the Bariatric Center. She now serves as a "standard bearer" for bariatric patients coming behind her, Dr. Bowers says. She shares her story with patients, as well as before-and-after photos, and tells them how much the program has helped her.</p>



<p>"This is the perfect job for me," Julie says. "I feel like I'm able to inspire patients. I tell them it's not easy, but it's worth it. And it will bring them longevity and happiness."</p>



<p>Julie stresses to patients that deciding to go through the bariatric program and have weight-loss surgery is something they must choose for themselves.</p>



<p>"It took me two tries," Julie says. "The second time was the right time for me, and it has to be the right time for them. But helping to overcome the judgment patients may feel from others is one of the reasons I want to share my own experiences now."</p>



<p>Julie says she also explains to patients that weight-loss surgery is about much more than appearance.</p>



<p>"Obviously, it gives your confidence a boost, but it also benefits your health and gives you a better quality of life," she says. "You just feel better. Your whole attitude toward life is better."</p>



<p>With her next cruise coming up in September, Julie says she no longer wonders if she'll be able to fit into her clothes by the time she boards.</p>



<p>"Now, I go into the closet and pull out an outfit and know it's going to fit," she says. "It's such an amazing feeling to hold my head high and not hide in a corner. Going through the bariatric program is the best decision I've ever made. My one regret is that I didn't do it sooner."</p>

<p>Starting a workout program or being physically active takes motivation and commitment. The key is to start slowly and do something you take pleasure in.</p>



<p>"If you hate swimming, don't try to start to become a swimmer. But (if) you enjoy dancing or other activities (such as) gardening, those are forms of activity that once you engage in, you increase your consistency and compliance that will have the most health benefits," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-1024x576.jpg" alt="a smiling older woman seated on a yoga mat, doing stretches" class="wp-image-256796" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Being active can build muscle strength and improve cognitive and cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>"Three percent, or 30 minutes a day, of our waking hours, if we commit that to physical activity, will have huge benefits," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>And for those young at heart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.</p>



<p>"As we get older, dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips to get started and stick with a workout plan:</strong></h3>

<li>Research workout routines.</li>

Most of the cases are among children under age&nbsp;5,&nbsp;and more than half of all cases have resulted in hospitalization.</p>



<p>"Measles is a viral infection that is highly contagious if you're not immune to it,"&nbsp;says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rajapakse-nipunie-s-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20308514?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse,</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;pediatric infectious diseases physician with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's Center.</a>&nbsp;"It’s generally characterized by fever, cough, runny nose and a pretty characteristic rash that can involve much of the skin surface."</p>



<p>Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 through a successful vaccine program, yet it persists globally. People can bring it to the U.S. if they're not vaccinated and get infected when they travel. The CDC says travelers should seek medical care if they develop symptoms of measles, including a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose or red, watery eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases out there. If you're in the same airspace as someone with measles, if they were there two hours ago and you're not immune to it, you can still contract measles, even without ever coming in face-to-face contact with that person. That's why the vaccination is so important. It gives you baseline immunity," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Complications from measles&nbsp;</h3>



<p>"Measles used to be a relatively common childhood illness. Since we've introduced very effective immunization, measles is quite rare to see here in the U.S.," says Dr. Rajapakse. "It can infect the brain, for example, resulting in something called encephalitis. It can cause severe pneumonia. We're trying to avoid these complications by vaccinating children before they get sick with it."</p>



<p>Children under the age of 5, adults over 20, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems are more likely to have complications from infection.</p>



<p>Complications from measles include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Diarrhea and vomiting.</li>



<li>Ear infection.</li>



<li>Bronchitis, laryngitis or croup.</li>



<li>Pneumonia.</li>



<li>Encephalitis.</li>



<li>Pregnancy problems, including premature or low-birth-weight babies.</li>
</ul>



<p>The CDC says that out of every 1,000 children with measles, about 1 to 3 die due to breathing and brain problems.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reducing measles outbreaks </h3>



<p>"Measles vaccination is a component of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/measles-and-rubella-virus-vaccine-live-intramuscular-route-injection-route/proper-use/drg-20062133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine</a>&nbsp;that is routinely given between 12 to 18 months of age, and then again in the preschool vaccines between 4 to 6 years of age," Dr. Rajapakse says.</p>



<p>Two MMR vaccine doses are 97% effective against measles, while one is about 93% effective.</p>



<p>Before the 1963 measles vaccination program, around 3 to 4 million people got measles every year in the U.S., according to the CDC.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-why-skipping-breakfast-can-be-bad-for-your-heart/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Why skipping breakfast can be bad for your heart</a></h2>



<p>Some say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Is it really? That's up for debate. However, skipping the first meal is not the healthiest choice and can even put someone at risk for health issues. In this Mayo Clinic Minute,&nbsp;Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, explains why.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/detecting-pancreatic-cancer-through-changes-in-body-composition-and-metabolism/">Detecting pancreatic cancer through changes in body composition and metabolism</a></h2>



<p>New research from Mayo Clinic&nbsp;represents a promising step toward identifying biological signals or biomarkers that may aid in early detection of pancreatic cancer. By tracking changes in body composition and metabolism, researchers are working to identify high-risk patients who could benefit from selective screening for the disease, which kills more than 50,000 Americans a year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-reducing-thumb-arthritis-pain/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Reducing thumb arthritis pain</a></h2>



<p>Thousands of Americans suffer from thumb arthritis. This disorder can greatly affect daily life and can make it a struggle to do simple things like opening doors or holding objects.</p>



<p>Dr. Sanj Kakar, a Mayo Clinic orthopedic surgeon who specializes in wrist and hand disorders, explains the condition and available treatments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-role-of-the-larynx-and-how-to-protect-it/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Role of the larynx and how to protect it</a></h2>



<p>When you talk, many parts of your body work together to make a sound. The larynx, also called the voice box, plays an important part in the process. </p>



<p>Dr. David Lott, a Mayo Clinic otolaryngologist who led the first known clinical trial on laryngeal transplantation in the U.S., says that, along with speech production, the larynx has many other vital roles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-recognized-for-disability-inclusion/">Mayo Clinic recognized for disability inclusion</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic recently received the highest possible score on the Disability Equality Index and was named a "Best Place To Work For Disability Inclusion" by the&nbsp;American Association of People with Disabilities&nbsp;and&nbsp;Disability:IN.</p>

Fibroid symptoms may include heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, bowel and bladder problems, and sometimes infertility and miscarriage. For women of African descent, fibroids may develop at an earlier age and be more frequent and severe. Many women, particularly Black women, are likely to undergo hysterectomy to alleviate significant health issues.</p>

<p>"Uterine fibroids are so common that women tend to normalize the pain," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/stewart-ebbie-a-m-d/bio-00095802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ebbie Stewart, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gynecologist and researcher. "Further study is needed to fully understand the health disparities in diagnosis and treatment of fibroids. Improving care for all women and especially Black women is a key research goal."</p>



<p>The traditional approach to treating fibroids has been observation to avoid unnecessary intervention and hysterectomy for more serious cases. Understanding the barriers to wider use of conservative nonsurgical treatment options is needed.</p>



<p>Over many years, Dr. Stewart and collaborators have published extensive research on facets of  uterine fibroids that disproportionately affect the African American population, calling it a public health issue in a 2013 <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(13)00834-X/abstract">study</a> published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. A 2021 <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40615-021-01059-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> in the Journal of Racial Ethnic Health Disparities provides insight into the ethnoracial factors and cultural barriers that women of color experience in the management and treatment of uterine fibroids.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New center to address a public health issue</strong></h2>



<p>To establish a specialized center for research on health disparities around uterine fibroids, Mayo Clinic was awarded a <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/newsroom/news/062124-two-fibroid-research-centers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$7.5 million grant</a> from the <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</a>, part of the NIH.</p>



<p>The new center at Mayo, named the Collaboration for Equity in Uterine Leiomyomas Center, will advance efforts to diagnose patients with fibroids earlier, identify barriers that make it difficult for patients to receive care, and increase communication between patients and healthcare providers, through the lens of health disparities. Dr. Stewart will lead the center’s effort and collaborate with researchers at the Fibroid Foundation; the University of Florida College of Medicine, Jacksonville; and the University of Mississippi Medical Center.</p>



<p>Community outreach is an important part of the project, including dissemination of material to women who suffer from fibroids and to healthcare providers, family members and policy makers. The collaboration involves researchers who participated in the COMPARE-UF fibroid registry project, a multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment strategies for uterine fibroids. Dr. Stewart was clinical leader of the <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(18)30396-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, first published in 2018 in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p>



<p>Researchers will also explore strategies to see if electronic health records can help women with fibroids receive more timely care. The data will be used to develop risk prediction models to aid in screening for fibroids and in spotting signs of progression to hysterectomy following conservative therapy, and to improve diagnosis.</p>



<p>"We believe the findings of our research will impact every facet of uterine fibroid care and improve the experience for all women," says Dr. Stewart.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is one of two institutions to receive NIH funding to establish specialized centers for research on health disparities. The University of Michigan will lead the other center.</p>

<p>The contaminated food may be linked to sliced meats from deli counters. When it comes to deli meats and hot dogs, make sure they are cooked to 165 F. Fruits and vegetables should be washed well.</p>



<p>Dr. Rajapakse says listeria is a significant concern for people with compromised immune systems and pregnant women because of the risk of spreading it to the unborn child.</p>



<p>"It can have really severe outcomes for babies, including risks of stillbirth or death," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>



<p>Symptoms of listeria can vary but may include fever, muscle aches, nausea, diarrhea, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions. It also can cause a flu-like illness in pregnant women, joint aches and pains, and fatigue also can occur.</p>



<p>Contact your healthcare team if you suspect you have a foodborne illness.</p>
