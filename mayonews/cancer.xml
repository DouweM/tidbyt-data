<p>Sisters often share certain genetic traits, such as hair color and facial features. But for three sisters from Minnesota, they discovered a much deeper connection — a shared genetic mutation known to dramatically increase their risk for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Their BRCA1 variants came to light through a <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a> DNA sequencing study. The study highlights the importance of genetic screening and the potential for hereditary health concerns. The diagnoses have prompted each of the sisters to take preventative actions for themselves, and their families. </p>



<p>"Having this knowledge is lifesaving and life changing," says Chris Swatfager, the middle sister from Minnesota who was the first to undergo the DNA testing and receive the difficult diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>BRCA1 is an inherited condition that significantly increases the likelihood of developing breast and ovarian cancer during a person's lifetime. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet#:~:text=Breast%20cancer%3A%20About%2013%25%20of,age%20(2%E2%80%934)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>, the breast cancer risk is 55%-72%, compared to approximately 13% for the general population. The risk for ovarian cancer ranges from 30%-60%, compared to approximately 1% for the general population. A parent with a BRCA1 mutation has a 50% chance of passing it down to their child. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Genetic screening reveals hidden health risks</h3>



<p>Given Chris's medical history of breast lumps, and her sister Carrie's breast cancer battle 16 years earlier, she says a clear picture suddenly came into focus. However, her original motivation to participate in the DNA sequencing study was driven by the heartbreaking death of her youngest sister, Amy, who had a heart attack in 2020. It marked the second heart attack-related death in the family. Chris believed there must be a hereditary link to heart disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris had learned that the Mayo Clinic study was screening for three actionable hereditary conditions, including a high cholesterol disorder called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/familial-hypercholesterolemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">familial hypercholesterolemia</a>, which raises the risk for a heart attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other conditions in the study were related to BRCA1, as well as BRCA2, which is associated with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Additionally,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank">Lynch Syndrome</a>&nbsp;was being assessed, which raises the risk of colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>Though none of these other conditions had crossed her mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To her surprise, Chris's results ruled out a genetic susceptibility to familial hypercholesterolemia, revealing instead a BRCA1 mutation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After undergoing comprehensive genetic counseling and receiving guidance from her physician, Chris opted for a double mastectomy and hysterectomy to mitigate her cancer risks. She also shared her diagnosis with her sisters, who, in turn, pursued genetic testing and received their own BRCA1 diagnoses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Carrie Patnode, who had already battled breast cancer at the age of 48, the diagnosis has brought assurance that she can stay ahead of any new cancer developments with increased screenings and scans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I think I may have done things differently if the BRCA test would have been provided when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer," Carrie says. "Now, after everything I've been through, I figure I'm going in every six months and getting mammograms every year and doing MRIs every year, and I'm confident they're going to find anything that reappears."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cindy Larson, the oldest among the sisters and a retired letter carrier, developed bladder cancer shortly after receiving her genetic test results. She has chosen to hold off on any preventative procedures related to her BRCA1 variant, guided by the advice of her Mayo Clinic physician,<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pruthi-sandhya-m-d/bio-00083681">&nbsp;Sandhya Pruthi, M.D.</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A new frontier in predicting disease risk</h3>



<p>Dr. Pruthi specializes in breast cancer prevention, and she’s working to pinpoint Cindy's genetic risk estimation related to her breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Pruthi says new and sophisticated genome sequencing technologies are opening the door to less invasive alternatives with the advancement of polygenic risk scores. The complex scores, compiled from a combination of data from thousands of a person's DNA variants, have the potential to offer precise insights into how patients should respond to a genetic mutation diagnosis associated with a cancer syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Polygenic risk scores allow us to potentially determine a patient's 5-year, 10-year and lifetime cancer risk," Dr. Pruthi says. "It may help us determine if and when a patient should undergo preventative procedures now or opt for surveillance over the next decade." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, Dr. Pruthi says the power of genetic testing lies in its ability to help identify patients at high risk for cancer, enabling earlier screening and mitigating the risk of metastatic cancer and premature deaths — something she sees all too often.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quest to bring genetic screening into everyday healthcare</h3>



<p>Mayo Clinic is advancing the idea of bringing genetic screening to routine patient care.</p>



<p>“We’re also studying the health utilization needs of those patients affected. This knowledge will transform the delivery of care in the coming decade,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights">Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.D.</a>, the Carlson and Nelson Endowed Executive Director for Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine.</p>



<p>Dr. Lazaridis says the immense impact of population-scale genetic screening reaches far beyond the benefits to individual people. It is also about the biological family members of those affected.</p>



<p>“It provides a collective wisdom that can shape public health strategies, increase disease prevention, and advance individualized medicine. It empowers people to be proactive about their own healthcare and prevention.” Dr. Lazaridis says.</p>



<p>For Chris, Carrie and Cindy, equally important to their own diagnoses is sharing the hereditary condition with their children and other blood relatives so they too can receive early disease detection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This affects generations of families and I hope genetic testing will soon become available for everyone," Chris says.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I'm a 28-year-old woman recently diagnosed with breast cancer. My care team recommends starting treatment as soon as possible. While I'm ready to do the necessary treatments, I'm worried about the affect it may have on my ability to have children in the future. Are there options that can help preserve my fertility during cancer treatment?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> When a person is <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/11-tips-for-coping-with-a-cancer-diagnosis">diagnosed with cancer</a>, the focus is often on immediate treatment and recovery. However, it's important to consider the long-term effects of cancer and its therapies on fertility. These treatments can significantly affect a person's reproductive organs, potentially altering their ability to have children in the future.</p>



<p>Cancer and its treatments can cause <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/benign-breast-disease">changes in your body</a>. For some people, cancer damages a part of the reproductive process and affects fertility. For others, the necessary cancer treatments interfere with fertility. The likelihood that cancer treatment will harm your fertility depends on the type and stage of cancer, the cancer treatment method and your age at the time of treatment.</p>



<p>Cancers that have a greater risk of affecting fertility – including through treatment – are breast cancer, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer and blood cancers like lymphomas.</p>



<p>Certain cancer treatments can harm your fertility. The effects might be temporary or permanent.</p>



<p>Cancer treatment and its effects might include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong><br>This common <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/scalp-cooling-therapy-prevents-hair-loss-during-chemotherapy">cancer treatment targets</a> and destroys active cells in the body. The ovaries and testicles, which are vital reproductive organs, contain a high number of active cells and are susceptible to damage from chemotherapy. This damage can affect the ability of the ovaries or testicles to produce viable eggs or sperm after cancer treatment, thus affecting fertility. Future fertility depends on various factors, such as the type, duration and dose of chemotherapy, and the patient's age.</li>



<li><strong>Radiation</strong><br>This therapy also can affect fertility, primarily when administered in the pelvic area at high doses. In some cases, patients may opt to have surgery to reposition the ovaries from the radiation field, reducing the risk of damage.</li>



<li><strong>Surgery</strong><br>Fertility also can be harmed by the surgical removal of the testicles, uterus or ovaries.</li>



<li><strong>Other cancer medications</strong><br>Hormone therapies used to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/medications-to-lower-breast-cancer-risk">treat certain cancers</a>, including breast cancer, can affect fertility. But the effects often are reversible. Once treatment stops, fertility may be restored.</li>
</ul>



<p>Various fertility preservation options may be available for cancer patients before they undergo cancer treatment.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Freezing</strong><br>For women, egg freezing or embryo freezing are standard practices, with minor differences depending on whether the patient has a partner or intends to use donor sperm. These methods involve hormonal stimulation with injections over a few weeks and retrieval of eggs from the ovaries. The eggs can be immediately cryopreserved or mixed with sperm for fertilization for the cryopreservation of embryos.</li>



<li><strong>Cryopreservation</strong><br>Another option is ovarian tissue cryopreservation, which involves removing and freezing part or all of an ovary. The ovarian tissue is divided into small strips and cryopreserved for future use. This method is particularly suitable for young girls who haven't reached puberty or women who need to start cancer treatment immediately. Men may consider sperm cryopreservation, which involves freezing and storing sperm for use at a later date. Testicular tissue cryopreservation also could be a consideration for boys before puberty.</li>



<li><strong>Suppression</strong><br>Ovarian suppression may be considered, but it is not a proven method of fertility preservation. Ovarian suppression involves medications temporarily suppressing ovarian activity, potentially protecting the ovaries from chemotherapy's effects.</li>
</ul>



<p>During cancer treatment, radiation shields can protect fertility in men and women. This procedure places small lead shields over the ovaries or testicles to reduce the radiation exposure they receive. Proton radiotherapy also can preserve fertility by delivering targeted therapy and minimizing exposure to adjoining organs and tissues.</p>



<p>The diagnosis of cancer and the treatment process can be overwhelming. However, you have options if you're concerned about how cancer treatment might affect your fertility. Don't wait. Talk with your care team about fertility preservation methods before you begin cancer treatment to help you make an informed choice. — <strong><em>By </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/alicia-ogle-np"><strong><em>Alicia Ogle</em></strong></a><strong>,<em> </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/obstetrics-and-gynecology"><strong><em>OB-GYN</em></strong></a><strong> <em>nurse practitioner, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire"><strong><em>Eau Claire, Wisconsin</em></strong></a><strong><em>, and </em></strong><a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/reproductive-endocrinology-and-infertility-fellowship-minnesota/department-and-faculty/"><strong><em>Jessica Bleess</em></strong></a><strong>,<em> </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/reproductive-endocrinology-and-infertility-in-minnesota/overview/ovc-20424328?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><strong><em>Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility</em></strong></a><strong><em> physician assistant, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My sister was just diagnosed with breast cancer and will have a double mastectomy. What types of reconstruction could she have, and when can the reconstruction be done? Are there any new reconstruction options that she should be aware of? I've heard about 3D tattooing. Is that an option?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Breast reconstruction is a procedure that restores the shape of your breast after <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">mastectomy</a>, which is an operation that removes your breast to treat or prevent breast cancer.</p>



<p>Breast reconstruction can be performed with either an implant — silicone devices filled with silicone gel or saline — or a patient's own tissue. Most people who undergo mastectomy tend to choose <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-reconstruction-implants/about/pac-20384934?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">implant-based breast reconstruction</a>, with a smaller portion opting for flap, or autologous, reconstruction. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-reconstruction-flap/about/pac-20384937?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Breast reconstruction with flap surgery</a> involves taking a section of tissue — skin, fat and occasionally muscle — from one area of your body, most often your abdomen, and relocating it to create a new breast mound.</p>



<p>Each method has its benefits and drawbacks. For example, implant-based breast reconstruction involves a shorter operation and recovery, whereas flap surgery is a longer, more complex operation with a longer recovery time. Also, implants are temporary and will require removal or replacement on average every 10 years. With flap surgery, typically, no further operations are necessary.</p>



<p>Breast reconstruction starts at the time of mastectomy. A team of breast oncologic and plastic surgeons working together to devise the appropriate plan for your needs is essential.</p>



<p>Depending on the location of the tumor and the patient's breast size, they may be a candidate for a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-cancer-surgery/about/pac-20385255#dialogId52876411?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">nipple-sparing mastectomy</a>, which allows for a more natural reconstruction appearance. A nipple-sparing mastectomy involves the removal of the breast tissue, but spares the skin, nipple and areola, also called the nipple-areolar complex.</p>



<p>If the tumor is abutting the nipple-areolar complex, the patient will need surgical removal of the nipple. Nipple reconstruction can be done with a 3D nipple-areola tattoo with or without the creation of a raised area of skin to reconstruct a raised nipple. 3D nipple tattooing is highly encouraged for all patients who have required surgical excision of the nipple-areolar complex. Data shows patients are more satisfied with reconstruction and can move forward from their cancer journey when reconstruction of the nipple is performed.</p>



<p>In the past, breast reconstruction would not provide the same sensations as before mastectomy. However, breast resensation is the new frontier within breast reconstruction. This is a new technique of breast nerve repair during breast reconstruction that can potentially restore feeling after a mastectomy. This can be done in one of two ways.</p>



<p>First, suppose the patient is a candidate for nipple-sparing mastectomy and is approximately a C cup or less at the time of mastectomy. In that case, we can identify the nerves on the lateral chest and bridge the gap beneath the nipple-areolar complex with a nerve graft. The nerve will then regenerate through the graft, providing sensation to the nipple-areolar complex. While this can take up to two years, it should restore light touch to the breast and nipple-areolar complex, but it will not fully return premastectomy breast sensation.</p>



<p>The second approach is pursued if the patient is undergoing flap surgery. We can identify a nerve on the tissue from the abdomen and connect that via nerve graft to a nerve in the chest. This can be an option for patients who have already had a mastectomy — and possibly implant-based breast reconstruction — and desire more sensation.</p>



<p>Breast reconstruction is an excellent option for many patients. It can give you a breast contour, provide symmetry to your breasts under clothing and help you avoid the need for an external prosthesis inside your bra. Many patients find that their self-esteem and body image improve after reconstruction, and it helps to erase physical reminders of their cancer journey. However, before breast reconstruction surgery, consult a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/plastic-reconstructive-surgery-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20473067?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">plastic surgeon</a> who is board-certified and experienced in breast reconstruction following mastectomy. <em>—</em> <strong><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/harless-christin-a-m-d/bio-20343911?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Dr. Christin Harless</a>, Plastic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>Mammograms have been a standard screening for breast cancer since the 1970s. They have transformed early breast cancer detection and diagnosis by identifying breast cancer before it causes signs and symptoms. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mammograms</a> have been shown to reduce the risk of dying of breast cancer and have saved countless lives.</p>



<p>New screening options go beyond traditional mammography with advancements that may not be familiar. Here's what you need to know about the most common options and which might be best for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mammogram</h2>



<p>A mammogram is an X-ray image of your breasts and is the breast cancer screening technique that most people think of. It also can be used for diagnostic purposes, such as to investigate symptoms or unusual findings on another type of imaging test.</p>



<p>During a mammogram, your breasts are compressed between two firm surfaces to spread the breast tissue. Then an X-ray captures black-and-white images that are displayed on a computer screen and examined by a radiologist for signs of cancer. A traditional mammogram creates two-dimensional images of the breast.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic Health System, healthcare providers offer screening&nbsp;mammography, beginning at 40, for women at average risk of breast cancer.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/8-faq-about-mammography-screening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Average risk of breast cancer</a>&nbsp;means women with no family history of breast cancer and no other risk factors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digital breast tomosynthesis</h2>



<p>This screening exam, also known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/3d-mammogram/about/pac-20438708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3D mammography</a>, has become a best practice in women's health for breast cancer-detecting technology. Breast tomosynthesis differs from traditional mammograms in how the image of the breast is obtained and, more importantly, viewed.</p>



<p>Like a traditional mammogram, your breasts are compressed between two firm surfaces to spread the breast tissue. A digital tomographic image is created, and the radiologist can view and manipulate the images on high-resolution computer monitors that enhance visualization of the structures within the breast tissue. The tomographic images help to detect small calcifications, masses and other changes that may be signs of early cancer.</p>



<p>Tomosynthesis, or 3D mammograms, are best practice for all women, regardless of their cancer risk.</p>

</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Molecular breast imaging</h2>



<p>This procedure uses a radioactive tracer and a special camera to take pictures of the breast tissue.</p>



<p>During the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/molecular-breast-imaging/about/pac-20394710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">molecular breast imaging (MBI)</a> exam, a small amount of radioactive tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer travels through your blood to your breast tissue. Cells growing quickly take up more of the tracer than slowly growing cells. Cancer cells often grow quickly and can be identified if they are taking up more of the tracer.</p>



<p>A special camera, called a gamma camera, detects the radiation released by the tracer. In the pictures made by the gamma camera, the cells that take up more of the tracer look brighter than the surrounding cells.</p>



<p>MBI provides the greatest benefit for women with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/in-depth/dense-breast-tissue/art-20123968" target="_blank">dense breasts</a>&nbsp;or intermediate breast cancer risk. As the density of breast tissue increases, the ability to detect breast cancer with screening mammography becomes more challenging. It's important to know that MBI does not replace, but is used in addition to, screening mammography for early breast cancer detection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Breast MRI</h2>



<p>Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast, also called&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-mri/about/pac-20384809" target="_blank">breast MRI</a>, is used to evaluate breast cancer or to help healthcare teams determine the causes of other problems in the breast. Breast MRI also is recommended as a screening exam for women with an elevated lifetime risk of breast cancer, such as a strong family history of breast cancer, genetic risk or other factors.</p>



<p>A breast MRI uses powerful magnets, radiofrequency detectors and a computer to create high-detail images of the breasts. A breast MRI may be done after a biopsy shows cancer, as a screening exam or possibly to further investigate a breast finding. Breast MRI also can evaluate the extent of any cancer, as well as evaluate the other breast.</p>



<p>Breast MRI may be used with mammography as a screening tool for detecting breast cancer in some people. This includes people with a high risk of breast cancer. It also includes people with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast cancer gene changes passed down through the family, called an inherited gene.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team about your risk for breast cancer and the benefits, risks and limitations of each screening option. In addition, discuss all changes to your breasts you notice and ask about an appropriate screening schedule for you.</p>

<p><em><strong>For her one-year anniversary, Luana Q., a Mayo Clinic patient, shares her liver transplant story. Luana was the 4,000<sup>th</sup> patient to receive a liver transplant since the program began at Mayo Clinic in Florida in 1998. For her transplant, the team used normothermic regional perfusion to preserve the donated organ. This innovative approach uses a machine to pass blood through organs in a donor's body after the heart has irreversibly stopped beating. The procedure also allows for a variety of therapeutic interventions, potentially enhancing the organ's quality before transplantation.</strong></em></p>



<p></p>



<p>On Oct. 22, 2022, I had my <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida. I live in New Smyrna Beach which is an hour and a half away from Jacksonville. I am so thankful for the donor who gave me the opportunity to continue to live a healthy life after my transplant.</p>



<p>I had <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver cancer</a> by the name of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This cancer developed from having <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-c/symptoms-causes/syc-20354278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hepatitis C</a> in prior years. Even though I went through the medical treatment of riboflavin and interferon for one year, and the treatment was successful (the hepatitis C was no longer detectable), we continued to monitor my bloodwork and liver biopsies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="296" height="640" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Luana-Quinette.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376503" style="aspect-ratio:0.4625;width:135px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Luana-Quinette.jpg 296w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Luana-Quinette-139x300.jpg 139w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" /></figure></div>


<p>In 2016, during a routine exam, a lesion was discovered on my liver which turned out to be HCC liver cancer. My doctor made arrangements for me to go to Mayo for further care.</p>



<p>My tumor was larger than acceptable for me to be a transplant candidate; however, the Mayo team did not give up. I was given the opportunity to have Y90 radioembolization, where a special radiation specifically targeted the tumor on my liver to shrink it.</p>



<p>Prayers were answered and the tumor shrank, so I could be placed on the liver transplant list. I had to wait six months for my Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score to increase, which placed me in a position to be called sooner for a transplant.</p>



<p>On Sept. 23, 2022, I received "the call" to come to Mayo for a possible liver transplant, but, unfortunately, the organ donor's liver was unsuitable for transplant, and the surgery was canceled. That was disappointing, but I am glad my care team thoroughly examined the organ.</p>



<p>Soon after, I was called again on Oct. 22, 2022, and had a successful liver transplant. I was given the best team of doctors and nurses who gave me the most wonderful care. I remained in the hospital for four days and continued my stay at the Gabriel House for another four weeks so I could return to Mayo for follow-up monitoring.</p>



<p>I am so honored to be the 4,000th liver transplant patient and praise Mayo for all the lives they change by successfully caring for each patient and their needs. The teams really care, and I never felt like just a number as that sometimes happens. I truly love the care that I continue to receive.</p>



<p>I feel each day is a special gift, and I truly am thankful to Mayo Clinic and my organ donor. I thank God for his love and mercy for me, and giving me this wonderful gift.</p>

<p>Risk can be a complicated and confounding concept, particularly when it comes to life-or-death situations like cancer. The discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the 1990s enabled many women to learn they are at high risk of developing breast cancer. More than a dozen other <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> genes have been identified since, but the risks associated with them have been far less certain. Research from Mayo Clinic has filled critical gaps in the understanding of how these genes predispose women to disease, in ways that directly influence patient care.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Siddartha-Yadav-200x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376410" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Siddhartha Yadav, M.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This is truly bench to bedside research," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/yadav-siddhartha-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20489847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siddhartha Yadav, M.D.</a>, a medical oncologist and breast cancer researcher. "Just finding out you have one of these genetic alterations is not good enough — we need to know the risk so we can mitigate that risk."</p>



<p>Dr. Yadav has been working with cancer geneticist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/couch-fergus-j-ph-d/bio-00027515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</a>, for the last six years to define the risks that come with inheriting various genetic variants. In 2021, they and nearly 60 other researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471974/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a seminal study</a>&nbsp;in the New England Journal of Medicine that provided more accurate risk estimates for 28 different breast cancer genes.</p>



<p>"We’ve known about these genes for quite some time," says Dr. Couch. "But nobody ever had enough information or enough data to really say anything about the risks associated with them."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aggregating Data to Estimate Risk</strong>s</h2>



<p>In 2016, Dr. Couch and his colleagues built a large, population-based study drawing from 17 established epidemiology studies such as the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study and the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention Studies. The result was the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility (CARRIERS) consortium, which amassed a collection of samples from approximately 35, 000 women with breast cancer and another 35,000 women without breast cancer.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/1299536_3506340_0027-200x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376409" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fergus Couch, Ph.D., is the Zbigniew and Anna M. Scheller Professor of Medical Research.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Analyzing these samples revealed that the risks associated with mutations for women in the general population were lower than previous estimates, which had been based on high-risk populations with a personal or family history of breast cancer. The analysis, published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471974/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seminal NEJM study</a>, indicated that 16 of the 28 genes previously thought to play a role in breast cancer did not increase a woman’s risk of disease.</p>



<p>"There was a lot of false information out there about what genes may or may not increase risk," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-00027285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>, breast cancer oncologist and director of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/research-programs/womens-cancer-program/breast-cancer-spore/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s Breast Cancer&nbsp;SPORE</a>, which has funded research in this area since its creation in 2005. The&nbsp;<a href="https://trp.cancer.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SPORE</a>, or Specialized Program of Research Excellence, is a cornerstone of the&nbsp;National Cancer Institute's efforts to promote collaborative, interdisciplinary translational cancer research.</p>



<p>"Dr. Couch’s work brought clarity, and led to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) taking at least one gene off their list of genes to test for," says Dr. Goetz.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/1173095_3367870_0012-200x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376408" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Updating Guidelines, Understanding Outcome</strong>s</h2>



<p>The NCCN is one of several organizations, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Breast Surgeons, that have set guidelines for screening for inherited breast cancer gene changes, known as germline genetic testing. "Deciding who needs testing is one of the biggest controversies in the field," says Dr. Yadav. "Some have suggested all women get tested; others have recommended testing only women of a certain age."</p>



<p>Dr. Yadav and his colleagues evaluated these criteria, applying them to a large patient registry that included nearly 4,000 women treated for breast cancer at Mayo Clinic. They found that the NCCN guidelines missed 35-50% of patients with disease-causing genetic mutations. The findings, published in 2020 in the&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32125938/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Oncology</a>, led NCCN and other organizations to expand their guidelines on germline genetic testing.</p>



<p>Another area where the Mayo team has made a significant impact is in linking breast cancer genes to clinical outcomes. According to Dr. Yadav, women newly diagnosed with cancer in one breast often want to know the chances that the disease will spread to the other breast or to other parts of the body. "For BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, we knew that their risks were high," he says. "But for these other genes that cause breast cancer, what happens to those women? There were no answers to that."</p>



<p>Using data from the CARRIERS consortium, the researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36623243/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">determined the risks</a>&nbsp;that women carrying different germline genetic mutations had of developing cancer in both breasts, known as contralateral breast cancer. For example, they found that carriers of ATM mutations did not have a significantly elevated risk of contralateral breast cancer, whereas those with BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 mutations had double the risk. The researchers believe the findings make genetic information more actionable, as different breast cancer genes appear to create tumors that behave quite differently.</p>



<p>At the molecular level, breast cancer is typically broken down into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/in-depth/breast-cancer/art-20045654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four major subtypes</a>&nbsp;— triple-negative, HER2-positive, luminal A and luminal B — each with different degrees of aggressiveness and responses to treatment. Through an industry collaboration with a genetic testing company, the Mayo team analyzed testing results from nearly 55,000 breast cancer patients and found that&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32091585/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different breast cancer genes</a>&nbsp;appear to drive each of the different subtypes.</p>



<p>"Those insights into tumor biology are critically important for treatment and prevention," says Dr. Goetz. "There are some drugs, for example, that work fairly well to reduce the risk of developing luminal A breast cancer, but they don’t do anything to reduce the risk of triple-negative breast cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Examining Variants of Uncertain Significance</strong></h2>



<p>BRCA1, BRCA2 and most of the other genes associated with breast cancer are normally involved in repairing damage to DNA. When these genes are defective, DNA damage can accumulate, allowing cells to grow out of control and turn cancerous. Researchers have identified hundreds of genetic alterations that are known to cause breast cancer, but they have also uncovered thousands more that could either cause disease or be benign. These variants of uncertain significance (VUS), as they are called, are a big problem for clinicians and patients alike.</p>



<p>"There’s 30,000 women, probably more, in the United States carrying these types of variants and we don’t know what to do with them," says Dr. Couch. "We’re supposed to just ignore those results, but the psychological impact is already there. We hear stories about women getting prophylactic surgeries on the basis of VUS results just because they’re so worried about them."</p>



<p>Dr. Couch has led&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35736817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive efforts</a>&nbsp;to reclassify the VUS lurking in breast cancer genes, methodically reproducing one variant after another in the lab and assessing their effect on DNA repair. "Our approach has proved invaluable in improving our understanding of these different variants, but it has been slow-going," he says. "In 15 years, we’ve done about 500 variants of BRCA2." Recently, his team ramped up its research by using high-throughput, CRISPR-based gene editing technology to generate each variant, which will enable them to create a catalog of every possible VUS and their impacts.</p>



<p>In the future, the researchers plan to continue probing the connections between genes and breast cancer, examining how cancers with different genetic mutations respond to therapy and even searching for previously undiscovered breast cancer genes.</p>



<p>"This is not just some esoteric research that stays in the lab or an academic publication," says Dr. Couch. "These findings get rapidly integrated into the clinical workflow, informing patients about the risks they face and how to manage them."</p>

It's the second-most common cancer diagnosed in women in the U.S., and it will affect 1 in 8 women, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. Much of the messaging around breast cancer research focuses on the disease in women. However, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374740?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer can occur in men</a> as well.</p>



<p>October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which makes this<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>a good time to learn about breast cancer in men.</p>



<p>An estimated 2,800 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in men in the U.S. this year, and about 530 men will die from the disease, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer-in-men/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. Men diagnosed with breast cancer at an early stage have a good chance for a cure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Signs and symptoms of male breast cancer can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>A painless lump or thickening in your breast tissue.</li>



<li>Changes to the skin covering your breast, such as dimpling, puckering, redness or scaling.</li>



<li>Changes to your nipple, such as redness or scaling, or a nipple that begins to turn inward.</li>



<li>Discharge from your nipple.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2>



<p>Factors that increase the risk of male breast cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Older age.</strong><br>The risk of breast cancer increases as you age. Male breast cancer is most often diagnosed in men in their 60s.</li>



<li><strong>Exposure to estrogen.</strong><br>If you take estrogen-related drugs, such as those used for hormone therapy for prostate cancer, your risk of breast cancer is increased.</li>



<li><strong>Family history of breast cancer.</strong><br>If you have a close family member with breast cancer, you have a greater chance of developing the disease.</li>



<li><strong>Klinefelter syndrome.</strong><br>This genetic syndrome occurs when boys are born with more than one copy of the X chromosome. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/klinefelter-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353949?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Klinefelter syndrome</a> may adversely affect testicular growth, resulting in smaller than normal testicles, which can lead to lower production of testosterone.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Liver disease.</strong><br>Certain conditions, such as cirrhosis of the liver, can reduce male hormones and increase female hormones, increasing your risk of breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Obesity.</strong><br>Obesity is associated with higher levels of estrogen in the body, which increases the risk of male breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Testicle disease or surgery.</strong><br>Having inflamed testicles or surgery to remove a testicle can increase your risk of male breast cancer.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some men inherit mutated genes from their parents that increase the risk of breast cancer. Mutations in one of several genes, especially a gene called&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>, put you at greater risk of developing breast and prostate cancers.</p>



<p>If you have a strong family history of cancer, discuss this with your healthcare team. They may recommend that you meet with a genetic counselor in order to consider genetic testing to see if you carry genes that increase your risk of cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Male breast cancer&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-breast-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374745?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank">treatment</a>&nbsp;often involves surgery to remove the tumor and surrounding breast tissue. Radiation therapy, hormone therapy and chemotherapy also may be recommended. If you've been diagnosed with breast cancer, your treatment will be based on the stage of your cancer, your overall health and your preferences.</p>

<p>There's also a treatment called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/radiofrequency-ablation-therapy-for-large-benign-thyroid-nodules/mac-20439239">radiofrequency ablation</a>&nbsp;(RFA), which uses heat to make the nodules smaller.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/stan-marius-n-m-d/bio-20055065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Marius Stan</a>, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist, says this nonsurgical treatment for shrinking thyroid nodules offers patients a safe and highly successful procedure. He says Mayo Clinic also is researching how RFA may be used to treat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid cancer</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Radiofrequency ablation, which many people might simply call an RFA, is a way of targeting a specific part of the thyroid, an abnormal part, by delivering high energy into that specific area of the thyroid and destroying it," says Dr. Stan.</p>



<p>He says patients with enlarged, benign thyroid nodules are good candidates for RFA.</p>



<p>"Patients will have an inch and a half to two inches thyroid nodules in diameter that we think are reaching the point where a problem is present or is likely going to be present," Dr. Stan says.</p>

<p>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) works by works by using heat to shrink or destroy benign thyroid nodules.</p>
</div></div>



<p>Along with retaining thyroid function, there are other advantages.</p>



<p>"The benefit is that we can do it in the outpatient setting, without the scar on the neck," he says.</p>



<p>Treating thyroid nodules is one application for RFA. Mayo Clinic is one of the leading U.S. institutions to research using RFA for thyroid cancer treatment.</p>



<p>"We hope that this will also be able to destroy a thyroid cancer very specifically, as opposed to a surgical approach that would eliminate part of the thyroid," says Dr. Stan.</p>

<p>A breast self-exam is an inspection of your breasts that you do on your own. To help increase your breast awareness, you use your eyes and hands to regularly observe the look and feel of your breasts.</p>



<p>Many breast changes detected during a breast self-exam have benign causes. This means they are not caused by cancer. Other changes may signal something serious like breast cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A breast self-exam that you do for breast awareness helps you understand the usual look and feel of your breasts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These self-exams aren't as effective as routine <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammograms</a> in detecting <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> or improving survival for women who have breast cancer. </p>



<p>Still, many healthcare professionals believe there is value in women becoming familiar with their breasts so they understand what's typical for them and can promptly report changes to their healthcare teams.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does a breast lump feel like?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A breast lump is a growth of tissue that develops within your breast. It may be described as a mass, growth, swelling, thickness or fullness. A breast lump can vary in the way it looks and feels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many women find lumps or changes in their breasts at various points in their menstrual cycles. These are typical changes that occur, and finding a change or lump in your breast is not a reason to panic. Breasts often feel different in different places. The look and feel of your breasts will also change as you age.</p>



<p>Watch for these breast changes:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>A distinct lump with definite borders.</li>



<li>A thickened, slightly more prominent area in your breast that's different from surrounding breast tissue.</li>



<li>Breast pain or tenderness.</li>



<li>Nipple changes, such as a nipple pulled inward (nipple inversion) or spontaneous fluid discharge from your nipple.</li>



<li>One breast that's noticeably larger than the other.</li>



<li>Other breast changes, such as redness, dimpling or pitting of the skin.</li>
</ul>



<p>Sometimes, a breast lump is a sign of breast cancer. That's why you should seek prompt medical evaluation.&nbsp;However, many breast lumps result from noncancerous (benign) conditions like<a>&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/benign-breast-disease">benign breast disease</a>, especially in women under 50.</p>



<p>Your family's cancer history can affect your cancer risk and the chance that a lump might be a more serious concern.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What causes breast lumps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A breast lump can develop as a result of conditions such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Breast cancer</li>



<li>Breast cysts</li>



<li>Fibrocystic breasts</li>



<li>Hamartoma, a noncancerous tumor in the breast</li>



<li>Injury or trauma to the breast&nbsp;</li>



<li>Mastitis</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can a mammogram determine what is causing a breast lump?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In some cases, yes. A mammogram can help your healthcare team determine the cause of the lump and if additional treatment is necessary.&nbsp;They also may recommend additional tests and procedures, such as ultrasound or biopsy.</p>



<p>Early detection and routine mammogram screenings are key to reducing death from breast cancer.&nbsp;That's why Mayo Clinic Health System recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer start screening mammograms yearly at 40.&nbsp;Average risk of breast cancer means women with no family history of breast cancer and no other risk factors for breast cancer. Women with a family history or other risks may need earlier or more frequent mammograms at the guidance of their healthcare team.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When should a breast lump be evaluated?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Any breast symptoms, such as a breast lump, nipple discharge or breast pain, should be evaluated by a medical professional.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schedule an&nbsp;appointment with your healthcare team if you notice:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>A breast lump is new or unusual and feels different from the surrounding tissue or tissue in your other breast.</li>



<li>A breast lump doesn't go away or gets bigger after your next menstrual period.</li>



<li>A breast lump changes and becomes bigger, firmer or more defined from surrounding breast tissue, especially if you have not had it examined by a healthcare professional previously.</li>



<li>Bloody, possibly spontaneous, discharge from your nipple.</li>



<li>Skin changes on your breast, such as redness, crusting, dimpling or puckering.</li>



<li>Your nipple is turned inward (inverted), although it isn't typically positioned that way.</li>
</ul>



<p>Your healthcare team may recommend <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-importance-of-supplemental-screenings-for-dense-breasts/">additional tests</a> and procedures to determine the cause of your breast changes.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a distinctive pattern in a specific set of 17 genes that may be associated with remission after treatment for&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/in-depth/breast-cancer/art-20045654" target="_blank">triple-negative breast cancer</a>. The multi-omics study,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-023-01656-x" target="_blank">published in Breast Cancer Research</a>, highlights the potential for further investigating this signature as a target for individualized medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately 10-15% of breast cancers fall into the category of "triple-negative," indicating that their growth is not driven through the hormone receptors for estrogen or progesterone, nor by the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In contrast, other breast cancers have at least one of these receptors, allowing for treatments that can target or block them to inhibit the cancer's progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Triple-negative breast cancer is known for its resistance to targeted therapies, leaving chemotherapy as the primary treatment option. While most patients initially respond well to the standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, nearly 20% of patients will experience recurrence after treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's crucial that we create tools that assist clinicians in making informed treatment decisions," says&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kalari-krishna-r-ph-d/bio-00095546" target="_blank">Krishna Rani Kalari, Ph.D.</a>, a lead author of the study and an associate professor of biomedical informatics at the Center for Individualized Medicine. "This 17-gene signature is one of the candidate tools that shows potential. However, for this signature to have clinical utility, there will need to be studies evaluating whether alternative drugs/drug combinations may work in this group of patients."&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Decoding pattern in 17 genes</h3>



<p>In their study, the researchers investigated tumor samples before and after treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer who failed to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Using multi-omics analysis and machine learning technologies, they examined changes in gene expression to understand the molecular underpinnings driving tumor recurrence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Multi-omics is an emerging multidisciplinary field of biological sciences that encompasses genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and more.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team identified 17 genes associated with relapse-free survival and found that many of the genes may play a role in triggering inflammation to initiate an immune system response. Dr. Kalari says failure to initiate immune response prevents the clearance of weakened tumor cells, thereby permitting the development of treatment resistance and disease re-occurrence.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quest for individualized medicine</h3>



<p>The study is an extension of Mayo Clinic's clinical prospective breast cancer study known as Breast Cancer Genome-Guided Therapy Study (<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/research/clinical-studies/beauty2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BEAUTY</a>). The goal of the study is to determine why some patient’s tumors respond to chemotherapy while others don't, and to use that knowledge as a catalyst to develop personalized medicine therapies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the team plans to further investigate the gene signature and test therapeutic strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-lead authors of the study are Mayo Clinic researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kalari-krishna-r-ph-d/bio-00095546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krishna Rani Kalari, Ph.D.</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/boughey-judy-c-m-d/bio-00027350">Judy Boughey, M.D</a>., and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-00027285">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>&nbsp;Additional authors include Xiaojia Tang, Ph.D. and Kevin Thompson, Ph.D. A comprehensive list of the authors, disclosures, and funding are available in the <a href="https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-023-01656-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>.&nbsp;</p>
