<p>A trip to Disney World in 2023 was an eye-opener for Katie Crow. It wasn't the rides, parades or immersive activities that caught her attention but that she struggled to have the energy to go to the amusement park every day.</p>



<p>"It wasn't the experience I wanted it to be. That's when I knew I finally needed to do something about my weight," says Katie, an endoscopy nurse with Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Crosse</a>, Wisconsin.</p>



<p>That summer, the 36-year-old saw her weight reach 296 pounds. Katie suffered from leg and back pain, had been diagnosed with severe <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/do-i-have-sleep-apnea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep apnea</a>, and her energy was at an all-time low. She also worried about developing diabetes and heart disease, which run in her family. Since 2019, she also had been coping with anxiety and depression.</p>



<p>"The worst part was I couldn't keep up with my kids," says Katie, the mother of three children, now ages 15, 13 and 3. "I was just surviving."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exploring the options</h2>



<p>No stranger to battling her weight, Katie had tried a slew of diets, but none were successful. In the spring of 2023, her primary care provider referred her to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/bariatric-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric Surgery Department</a> at Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse. There she learned about her options, which included <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-skinny-on-weight-loss-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss drugs</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a>.</p>



<p>"I considered the weight-loss drugs, but at the time, some hadn't been approved yet, and given the side effects, they didn't seem like an option for me," says Katie. "But the statistics showing the success of bariatric surgery sounded promising."</p>



<p>Katie hadn't decided on her next steps, and then came the Disney World trip. The trip turned out to be the push she needed to finalize her decision to proceed with surgery, even though she was nervous about the permanent nature of the procedure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing weight-loss surgery</h2>



<p>With the decision made, Katie started her bariatric surgery journey, which included various consultations, a psychological examination and a two-week pre-op diet to prepare her body for the surgery. She also met with <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/kathriena-greenwell-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathriena Greenwell, M.D.</a>, who would perform the surgery.</p>



<p>"Dr. Greenwell took the time to answer all my questions and thoroughly explain the risks and benefits," says Katie.</p>



<p>"Katie was an excellent candidate for surgery. Since the surgery, she's been very motivated in her weight-loss goals, dedicated to the weight-management program and is taking her lifestyle changes seriously," says Dr. Greenwell.</p>



<p>In December 2023, Katie underwent surgery. While her body healed, she was on a restricted diet for six weeks.</p>



<p>"I thought I'd never eat real food again," says Katie. "But I'd made the commitment and was determined to make it work."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="325" height="400" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow-before-and-after.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389786" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow-before-and-after.jpg 325w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow-before-and-after-244x300.jpg 244w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making lifestyle changes</h2>



<p>When she made her choice, Katie knew that this was a lifelong commitment. She decided to track her experience on social media, posting about the ups and downs of her weight loss and the changes she was making. The most noticeable was the pounds she was shedding. In five months, Katie lost 109 pounds and 84 inches off her body. She'd dropped from size 3X to large.</p>



<p>There were other changes, as well. Dr. Greenwell says Katie's&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank">body mass index, or BMI</a>, has decreased from 49.26 to 31, and she no longer is considered morbidly obese. Dr. Greenwell also noted that Katie has stopped experiencing gastric reflux and anticipates that as she loses more weight, she won't require a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine to treat her sleep apnea.</p>



<p>"Hopefully, by losing weight now while she's young, it will prevent her from developing the complications of obesity, including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension," says Dr. Greenwell.</p>



<p>Katie also has seen other personal victories beyond the numbers on the scale. Her leg and back pain are gone, she doesn't worry if a chair will hold her when she sits down, and she delights in shopping for clothes wherever she wants. Her anxiety and depression also have subsided.</p>



<p>"I have more energy than before," says Katie. "My goal is to get down to 150 pounds, but based on the way I feel now, I'd be happy staying at this weight. Bariatric surgery is a tool, but you still have to do the work every day. It requires mental toughness and dedication; I didn't realize how challenging it would be mentally."</p>



<p>For those considering weight-loss surgery, Katie advises researching the process and understanding the commitment you'll be making.</p>



<p>"Going in, you know that you're going to be on vitamins and supplements forever, you won't be able to tolerate certain foods, you need to monitor your protein and hydration, and you have to become a regular exerciser," says Katie. "But ultimately, you have to look at the bigger picture.</p>



<p>"I'm no longer just surviving; I'm thriving. I've become the mom I always dreamt of being," she says. "My only regret is that I didn't do this sooner."</p>

<p>Twenty-seven-year-old Ani Roy, a patient, Mayo Clinic staff member and transmasculine nonbinary person, says the IBD Pride Clinic is a place of comfort.</p>



<p>Ani doesn't take eating for granted. They were diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2017 after experiencing painful stomach aches and, at times, being unable to eat.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It was difficult to digest foods</strong></h3>



<p>"The only thing that I was really able to eat was chicken strips and raspberry iced tea. For some reason, those were the only things that didn't make me want to vomit," explains Ani.</p>



<p>Inflammatory bowel disease took a toll on Ani's body, causing frequent trips to the toilet with bloody diarrhea and other symptoms.</p>



<p>"It got to the point where I was starting to pass out," they say. "I was shaking and just, like, sweating, feeling very faint and wasn't really able to function as a human being."</p>



<p>After several hospitalizations and failed medications, Ani had their colon and rectum removed, leaving them with an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/ostomy/art-20045825">ileostomy</a>. The surgical procedure creates an opening in the stomach to divert stool. Waste is collected in an ostomy bag that's attached to the abdomen," says Ani.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crohn's disease is mentally and physically challenging</strong></h3>



<p>"It is a very big mental adjustment," they say.</p>



<p>With the stigma surrounding the ileostomy and their gender identity and sexual orientation, Ani reached out to the Mayo Clinic IBD Pride Clinic for support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389699" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Patient Ani Roy talks with Dr. Victor Chedid.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"Many LGBTQ+ patients suffer in silence," says Dr. Victor Chedid, director of the Mayo Clinic IBD Pride Clinic. </p>



<p>"They might be struggling with their identity internally. And add to it the fact that you're struggling with your diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, that has a double or additional psychological impact on you," says Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>"It's so nice to go to a provider that is informed about the LGBTQ+ community so that I don't feel like I have to educate them on that part of me. I can just be that part of me," says Ani.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healing and Hope</strong></h3>



<p>The IBD Pride Clinic is staffed by healthcare professionals who are trained to be sensitive in the care of LGBTQ+ patients.</p>



<p>"This is a safe space for you to talk to us about your inflammatory bowel disease and anything that might be impacting your life," says Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ani is turning their pain into purpose, sewing ostomy bag covers for themselves and others. Living life one day — and one stitch — at a time.</p>



<p>"Overall, I'm doing pretty well, living life as best as I can," says Ani.</p>

<p>Rich Bugay, an HVAC business owner, husband, and father to two children, hadn't been feeling well for over a year. What started out as sinus issues gradually turned into severe acid reflux and exhaustion, making it hard for Rich to get through the workday.</p>



<p>"I wasn't feeling well — I had a lot of acid reflux and stomach discomfort. I had been going to a lot of different doctor visits, like my family practitioner, and I wasn't getting any answers," says Rich. "And so, at some point, I decided I wanted to go to the best place I could go."</p>

<p>Rich and his wife, Lori, left their house in Escanaba, Michigan, and drove more than six hours to Mayo Clinic in Rochester for an appointment with Dr. Houssam Halawi, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist.</p>



<p>During the appointment, Dr. Halawi listened to Rich's history, concerns and symptoms.</p>



<p>"And what caught my attention was, he had a lot of different symptoms that didn't really belong in the GI (gastrointestinal) world," says Dr. Halawi. "And at that point, in my mind, I was thinking this is not an acid reflux problem."</p>

<p>When Dr. Halawi listened to Rich's heart, he heard a suspicious murmur. He knew something — potentially big — was going on, and he recommended that Rich receive an urgent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856#:~:text=An%20echocardiogram%20uses%20sound%20waves%20to%20create%20pictures%20of%20the,disease%20and%20other%20heart%20conditions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>. An echocardiogram is a common test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart to find heart disease and other heart conditions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich was hesitant to have the echocardiogram since he just wanted some relief from his presumed acid reflux and didn't think he had a life-threatening issue.</p>



<p>Knowing that Rich would most likely go home if the echocardiogram couldn't be scheduled quickly, Dr. Halawi asked the scheduling team if there was any way they could arrange the echocardiogram for the next day. When the scheduler asked, "Would tomorrow morning work for you?" Dr. Halawi didn't expect it to be that quick.</p>



<p>Rich and Lori decided to stay at Mayo Clinic for the echocardiogram the next morning.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Confirming suspicions</h2>



<p>Kylie Marvin, the sonographer who performed the echocardiogram, immediately noticed something was seriously wrong. She walked out into the hallway and informed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jain-c-charles-m-d/bio-20543120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Charles Jain</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, about her findings.</p>



<p>"His aorta was severely dilated, well over what we would traditionally consider as the surgical cutoff for elective intervention," says Dr. Jain.</p>



<p>A severely enlarged aorta — the pipe that delivers blood out of the heart — could have acute complications, such as a rupture, which can be life-threatening.</p>



<p>The echocardiogram also showed that Rich had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bicuspid-aortic-valve/cdc-20385577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bicuspid aortic valve</a>.</p>



<p>The aortic valve usually has three cusps. A bicuspid valve has only two cusps. Rich's bicuspid valve wasn't closing tightly, which was causing blood to flow backward.</p>



<p>Dr. Jain called a radiologist and arranged an urgent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> for Rich that same day. The results of the CT scan confirmed the findings, and Dr. Jain called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bagameri-gabor-m-d/bio-20384030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gabor Bagameri,</a> a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular surgeon, who was willing to make room in his schedule to quickly see Rich and arrange for surgery.</p>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic, the needs of the patient always come first, and even in the middle of the night, 24/7, you can always reach for help," says Dr. Bagameri.</p>



<p>He encouraged Rich that his heart problems were fixable and advised him not to wait to undergo surgery.</p>



<p>"He let me think about it and came back into the room about five minutes later and he says, 'OK, so we're going to do this Thursday, right?' I say, 'You know it.' And he says, 'I knew you were going to say that!' So, we were ready," says Rich.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"Like a well-oiled machine<strong>"</strong></h2>



<p>On the day of the surgery, Rich said everything was very structured and organized. The surgery itself was a success, as was his hospital stay.</p>



<p>"Like a well-oiled machine, everything just went so well, so smoothly," says Lori. "I've never experienced anything like that before, and that's how healthcare should be everywhere. Everyone deserves to be treated like they do here."</p>



<p>Now, nearly six months after his procedure, Rich feels almost 100% better.</p>



<p>"They saved my life," says Rich. "I'm a completely different person — I feel like a million bucks. I can do what I want to do, and my energy levels are much better."</p>



<p>Looking back on the experience, Dr. Halawi recognizes that Rich wouldn't have had such a positive outcome without every single person involved at Mayo Clinic. Dr. Jain echoes that sentiment, "When there are patients who are having a significant abnormality, particularly with urgency, such as Rich's, everything is already set up for teamwork to be natural, and fortunately, this makes it all relatively seamless."</p>



<p>Reflecting on his healthcare journey, Rich says that you need to advocate for yourself.</p>



<p>"If you haven’t been feeling right for a long time and feel like you're not getting answers, come to Mayo Clinic because they'll get to the bottom of it," says Rich.</p>

<p>People often associate IBD with the bathroom because of its symptoms, but it's a serious and chronic condition. There are two main types of IBD: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353309?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353331?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a>.</p>



<p>"Ulcerative colitis only impacts the colon and causes inflammation in the entire colon, while Crohn's disease can impact anywhere from the mouth to the anus," says Dr. Chedid.</p>

<p>Patients often experience diarrhea, rectal bleeding, fatigue, weight loss, and stomach and joint pain.</p>



<p>"Some patients might develop what we call extraintestinal manifestations of their inflammatory bowel disease. And these can impact other organs. That means organs that are beyond the intestines," explains Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>There is no cure and no exact cause for IBD, but there are medications to reduce inflammation. Also, watching what you eat can help alleviate some symptoms.</p>



<p>"We have to have a focus on diets that are high in anti-inflammatory foods and antioxidants, and low in foods that are processed that can be proinflammatory, says Dr. Chedid.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatments to manage inflammatory bowel disease</h2>

<p>You experience sudden, intense pain in your abdomen or back pain between your shoulder blades — maybe even nausea or vomiting. You could have gallstones.</p>



<p>"Typically, symptoms of gallbladder-related pain is pain associated with meals. Usually after you eat meals with fatty foods," says Dr. Jorge.</p>



<p>He says there are several reasons why your gallbladder can form gallstones. The most common cause is what you eat. A diet high in fiber and low in cholesterol and fat will reduce your risk.</p>



<p>"Native Americans and Hispanic populations have a higher risk of developing gallstones and so do women. And as we get older, we're at higher risk of developing gallstones," says Dr. Jorge.</p>



<p>He says, once you have gallstones, they won't go away on their own. Recommended treatment is surgery to remove your gallbladder.</p>



<p>"It's an organ that people can live without and not have any long-term consequences from," says Dr. Jorge. "We take out the gallbladder not just because it has stones, but it's because it's where most stones are formed. But there is a small percentage of patients that can develop stones within the bile ducts themselves."</p>

<p>"Irritable bowel syndrome is a common disorder in the United States, affecting approximately 10% of U.S. adults," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lacy-brian-e-m-d-ph-d/bio-20392407?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Brian Lacy</a>, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist.</p>



<p>The symptoms of IBS are sometimes embarrassing and can affect a person's physical and emotional well-being.</p>



<p>"Patients have symptoms of disordered defecation. And that, in some patients, means constipation, skipping days without a bowel movement, straining of a bowel movement, or diarrhea, loose, watery urgent bowel movements," says Dr. Lacy.</p>

<p>The exact cause of IBS is still unclear, but it's believed to be a combination of factors, including changes in the gut microbiome and food intolerances.</p>



<p>IBS is now categorized as a disorder of gut-brain interaction, which means there is a problem with how the gut and the brain communicate with each other.</p>



<p>"That stress, which can affect the brain, then sends signals to the gut, changing gut function and worsening your IBS symptoms," says Dr. Lacy.</p>



<p>There is no cure for IBS, but symptoms can be managed. Try eating smaller, more frequent meals, and exercising regularly. Deep breathing and yoga are also helpful to reduce stress.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When to see a doctor for irritable bowel syndrome</h3>



<p>See your healthcare professional if you have significant changes in bowel habits. Some severe symptoms include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bloody stools.</li>



<li>Unintended weight loss.</li>



<li>Unexplained vomiting.</li>
</ul>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new drug has been shown to increase healing and regeneration of the liver after major surgery, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867424002253?via%3Dihub">study published in the scientific journal Cell</a>. Researchers hope that this could lead to more surgical options for patients diagnosed with advanced liver tumors and liver failure.</p>



<p>"This research is significant because this is the first drug of its kind to show an increase in healing and regeneration of the liver after major surgery," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/nyberg-scott-l-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Nyberg, M.D., Ph.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon and co-senior author of the study. "This discovery has the potential to improve the treatment of liver failure, increase the safety of liver transplantation for living donors and potentially avoid the need for a liver transplant in some cases."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers collaborated with researchers at <a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tubingen University Hospital</a> in Germany, who led the <a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/das-klinikum/pressemeldungen/628?press_str=">project</a>. "Our drug candidate would not only be an urgently needed treatment option in oncological liver surgery but, by enabling safe living donor liver transplantations, also holds the promise to overcome the major problem of organ shortage in the field of liver transplantation," says Lars Zender, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author of the study from Tubingen.</p>



<p>Liver disease remains a major health concern, <a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(23)00194-0/fulltext#:~:text=Liver%20disease%20accounts%20for%20over,for%20600%2C000%20to%20900%2C000%20deaths." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">causing an estimated 2 million deaths</a> worldwide per year. While healthy livers have a nearly unlimited ability to regenerate themselves, that is not the case for livers that are damaged. As a result, surgeons treating a patient with primary liver tumors are limited in how large of a section of the liver can safely be removed to avoid liver failure.</p>



<p>The study found that a drug called HRX215 inhibits the MKK4 protein found in liver cells. That appears to trigger the self-healing function of the liver, allowing it to regenerate. Before the drug was tested in 48 healthy volunteers within the phase 1 study, it was investigated in animal models. The preclinical study was able to show that the use of HRX-215 increased liver regeneration and prevented liver failure, even after the removal of 85% of the organ. The phase 1 study found excellent safety and tolerability of the drug in people. Additional clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of the drug in humans.</p>



<p>Researchers are hopeful that this discovery will one day create more surgical options for patients with advanced liver tumors by allowing more of the liver to be safely removed. It also has the potential to benefit patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-liver-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20352863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute and chronic liver failure.</a> This drug could potentially allow for successful <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/care-at-mayo-clinic/pcc-20384845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplants</a> from a smaller portion of a healthy donor's liver, and thus posing less risk to healthy donors. Often, this liver is too small to successfully take over the function of the full-sized liver removed from the recipient. The hope would be that this drug could allow for rapid liver regeneration, creating a new safe transplant option for people struggling with liver failure. This drug also could potentially eliminate the need for a liver transplant for some patients.</p>

<p>Colorectal cancer, the third-most common cancer in the U.S., has been rising among younger people for the past two decades. It is not one type of cancer but two cancers: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colon cancer</a>, which starts in the large intestine, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rectal cancer</a>, which begins in the last part of the large intestine, known as the rectum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Derek Ebner, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/sections/overview/ovc-20348241?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gastroenterologist</a>, notes that colorectal cancer has been increasing in adults under age 50, particularly for rectal cancer.

<p>"Historically, colorectal cancer was equally divided along the colon and rectum, but particularly for those with early onset colorectal cancer — age less than 50<sub>&nbsp;</sub>— we're seeing higher rates of rectal cancer among the younger onset," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/07/a-medical-illustration-of-rectal-cancer-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of rectal cancer" class="wp-image-195705 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/07/a-medical-illustration-of-rectal-cancer-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/07/a-medical-illustration-of-rectal-cancer-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">

</div></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Warning signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Dr. Ebner says four key symptoms have been identified for people under 50 who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, seeing blood with bowel motions, as well as iron deficiency anemia," he says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="804" height="452" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg" alt="Graphic of warning signs of colorectal cancer with Mayo Clnic identifier" class="wp-image-383697" style="width:856px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg 804w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Warning signs of colorectal cancer</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Ebner notes that blood loss after bowel movements, even if not visibly apparent, can lead to low iron levels.</p>



<p>"If on a blood test, for example, we see a sign of iron deficiency, that would then prompt us to explore further," he says.</p>



<p>Even though it may be embarrassing, he stresses, "If you have any of those symptoms, you need to share it with a healthcare provider. That way, they can navigate those subsequent steps."</p>



<p>Which can lead to early treatment and better outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reducing risks of colorectal cancer</h2>

<p>While it's not possible to completely prevent cancer, there are ways to reduce your risks and that includes following a healthy lifestyle.</p>



<p>"Abiding by a healthy lifestyle is critical," says Dr. Ebner. "Following a well-rounded diet,  staying physically active, for instance, perhaps can be protective. The other key, though, is just being very mindful of those symptoms, and then also underscoring the importance of screening."</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Screening</strong>: Talk to your healthcare team about colorectal cancer screening.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise</strong>: Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Eat fruits, veggies and whole grains.</li>



<li><strong>Weight</strong>: Maintain a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Don't smoke, limit alcohol consumption.</li>
</ul>

<p>"What we need to know about taking any intervention for obesity, including these two new medications, is that they're not a quick fix. They're not a magic pill or, in this case, a magic injection," says Dr. Acosta, a Mayo Clinic expert in treating obesity and co-author of "The Mayo Clinic Diet Rx."</p>



<p>He says in order to achieve healthy, long-term weight loss, tools like weight-loss medications need to be part of a multidisciplinary program that includes diet and exercise routines.</p>



<p>"The diet is still key. What this medication is doing is suppressing our appetite, so I don't feel that hungry, so I can eat less. So, diet is important," says Dr. Acosta.</p>



<p>Dr. Acosta recommends sticking to a healthy, low-calorie, high-protein diet to ensure healthy weight loss.</p>



<p>"When the medications or effects are coming off, or we want to stop the medications, it's important that we consider what diet intervention I'm going to do — what changes I'm going to do to my lifestyle, to my diet, in my exercising, my physical activity — in order to keep that weight off for a longer period of time."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Two common types of inflammatory bowel disease</h3>



<p>IBD is a broad term for chronic inflammation of your digestive tract. Two types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</p>



<p>“Ulcerative colitis really tends to only involve the colon and be more of a superficial type inflammation; whereas Crohn's disease can impact anything in the intestine, essentially, from the mouth all the way down to the anus," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<p>She says diet alone does not cause IBD. While some foods may reduce symptoms, there is no one proven diet to control inflammation.</p>



<p>"The right diet is probably different for each individual, based on the type of IBD that they have, the location of their disease, whether they've had surgeries or other complications," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Young Hispanic or Latina woman cuts vegetables, bowl of fruit" class="wp-image-373059" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1.jpg 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Diet recommendations for inflammatory bowel disease depend on the indivdual. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid ultraprocessed foods, added sugars and animal fats. And drink plenty of fluid to stay hydrated.</p>



<p>Diet does not replace medical treatment. Dr. Johnson says there are effective <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20353325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> options, so it is important to work with your healthcare provider.</p>



<p>"The tenant of therapy we have are immune-suppressing-type therapies that try to target that inappropriate response to the intestines and then calm down that inflammation within the gut," she says.</p>
