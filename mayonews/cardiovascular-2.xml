<p><em>World Heart Day is September 29</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>JACKSONVILLE, Florida — Leg pain and leg cramps aren’t always an orthopedic issue: Both can be signs of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peripheral artery disease</a>, or PAD, a serious blood-flow issue with implications for the heart. In this expert alert, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/erben-young-m-m-d/bio-20446384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Young Erben, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/vascular-and-endovascular-surgery/overview/ovc-20458819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vascular surgeon</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/international" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Jacksonville, Florida, explains how the most common form, PAD that affects the legs and feet, is treated. Options include a surgical technique from the past that Mayo surgeons are reviving and refining to offer new hope to patients with advanced PAD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In peripheral artery disease, narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the affected limbs. They do not get enough blood flow to keep up with the demand. It is important to manage PAD as early as possible, Dr. Erben says. In the worst cases, PAD can progress to open sores that do not heal, causing tissue death and limb loss.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Dr.-Young-Erben_1655644_3919639_0016-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-394196" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Dr.-Young-Erben_1655644_3919639_0016-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/Dr.-Young-Erben_1655644_3919639_0016.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Young Erben, M.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Globally, peripheral artery disease tends to be undertreated, even though doctors widely recognize it as a risk factor for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>. PAD has become more prevalent in recent years; at least 113 million people worldwide 40 or older have the disease, <a href="https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/library/global-burden-peripheral-artery-disease-and-its-risk-factors-1990-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2023 report shows</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lower extremity PAD, or PAD in the legs and feet, is a spectrum,” Dr. Erben says. “It ranges from people who have leg pain when walking to more advanced cases, where the blood flow to the leg is so impaired that patients are in pain when they’re resting or are developing wounds in their toes and feet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Common symptoms include leg pain or cramps while walking and small sores on the feet that do not heal, Dr. Erben says. Your first inclination might be to think of these as small things to ignore, but it is best to bring up these symptoms with your healthcare team, she advises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Especially if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or smoke cigarettes and you have these aches and pains, bring it up to your doctor because it may uncover something,” Dr. Erben says. “Those little details are how we catch most PAD.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Treatment depends on where someone is on the spectrum. Early on the spectrum, treatment typically includes:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Addressing risk factors for peripheral artery disease such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high cholesterol</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking/basics/quitsmoking-basics/hlv-20049487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Screening for additional blood-flow problems, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>, may be needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Developing a walking program — typically involving time on a treadmill — that the patient can pursue at home or with a physical therapist or trainer.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>“Walking develops new collateral blood vessels and increased blood flow to the legs,” Dr. Erben explains. “I have seen it with my patients over time: Over three to six months, if they’re very diligent about walking, the pain with walking will diminish, and people who are in the very early stages of PAD can almost go back to normal.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>People in the middle of the PAD spectrum will have more plaque buildup and blockages in blood vessels in their legs. Medication may be needed to increase blood flow. In some cases, a procedure may be needed, such as the minimally invasive insertion of balloons and/or stents to open arteries; surgery to remove blockages; or bypass surgery, in which a surgeon removes a vein from another area in the body and connects it above and below a blocked artery to improve blood flow, Dr. Erben says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blood thinners may be prescribed to help maintain the improved circulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the most advanced peripheral artery disease, people may have ulcers in their feet that become infected. The goal then becomes saving the affected limb: Surgeons may perform bypasses and, in some cases, an operation called deep vein arterialization (DVA), in which they connect an artery with a vein to try to provide additional blood flow to help wounds heal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This procedure was pioneered elsewhere in the 1970s. It lost popularity amid the development of less-invasive techniques such as balloons and stents that could be used earlier in PAD. Vascular surgeons at Mayo Clinic are now reviving and refining it, Dr. Erben says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is considered an innovation, but it is one of those that was an old technique, then somehow forgotten, and now it has been resurrected. We started doing this roughly three years ago for patients whose limbs are threatened in the last stage of PAD and we are having success.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In very advanced cases of peripheral artery disease, treatment may require amputation of the affected limb, such as toes or the leg below or above the knee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The worst-case scenarios with advanced PAD and the success often seen when the disease is recognized and managed early, are why it’s important to tell your doctor if you start experiencing recurring <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscle-cramp/symptoms-causes/syc-20350820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leg cramps</a>, also known as charley horses; leg pain that starts with exercise and ends with rest or that doesn’t go away; or a foot sore, even a small one, that lingers, Dr. Erben says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The mild symptoms are the ones that people tend to ignore,” Dr. Erben says. “Unfortunately, they often do not realize that they have a problem until it becomes a dire problem. The most important message that I can give to patients is that you may think it’s a little complaint, but please bring it up to your doctor. Because it may uncover something that you never thought of.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."

<p>"Colorectal cancers and breast cancers are on the rise in the Hispanic community. And one of those reasons may be from lack of preventive screening," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says culture, access to care and past experiences contribute. But early screening can prevent future serious health issues.</p>



<p>"Screening tests for diabetes&nbsp;(such as checking a simple blood sugar), for cardiovascular disease to prevent strokes&nbsp;(such as checking on cholesterol and blood pressure), colon cancer screening,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/when-to-start-regular-breast-cancer-screenings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer screening</a>&nbsp;for females, are all available tools," he says.</p>



<p>Talk with your doctor to determine the right preventive screenings and when to begin. For instance:&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Colon cancer screening for both men and women, usually at age 45, is an option, breast cancer screening for women in their 40s such as with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram,</a>" he says.</p>

<p>Dr. Bracamonte recommends having a list of questions for your doctor about what you can do to stay healthy.</p>



<p>"Have that list prepared about what I should get done to keep me healthy in the long term. What behaviors can I do in the long term to stay healthy? Because I think prevention is a key," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<p>Genetic technology has the potential to significantly improve human health by improving disease risk prediction and guiding prevention strategies. The development of a new genetic test called a polygenic risk score is a major advance. Still, it may widen health disparities because such scores may not work equally well for different populations. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kullo-iftikhar-j-m-d/bio-00084951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iftikhar Kullo, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic, believes that global collaboration is needed to refine polygenic risk scores so they perform equitably across people from diverse groups.</p>



<p>Dr. Kullo recently authored a perspective piece in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01843-2#:~:text=Such%20collaborations%20should%20be%20guided,assessment%2C%20global%20collaboration%20is%20critical." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Genetics</a>, where he made the case for efforts to bring genomics to low- and middle-income countries. His argument is that the information gleaned from testing could not only benefit local populations but also many other groups around the world, including in the U.S. Here, he elaborates on this.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You've noted that the disease burden worldwide is shifting from communicable diseases such as &nbsp;hepatitis and influenza to noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer. How can genetics address this shift?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> The shift from infectious disease to noncommunicable disease is part of the "epidemiologic transition." Famines and pandemics were once the leading cause of mortality, but fortunately, these were addressed by antibiotics, vaccinations and adequate food production. Now, we live longer and, as a result, are prone to developing other diseases like heart disease, diabetes or cancer. One of the ways that we can reduce the burden of these noncommunicable diseases is to employ better ways of predicting risk. For many of these conditions, we have existing tools for risk prediction, but they don't always perform as well as we would like them to.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You are referring to a new genetic test called a polygenic risk score. Could you explain what a polygenic risk score is, and how it works?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Genetically, humans are 99.9% similar. Our genome has three billion letters (A, G, T and C), and every 1,000 letters or so, there is a variation or difference between any two people. These differences, or variants, account for how we look or behave, how we might react to drugs, and our predisposition to different diseases. Polygenic risk scores add up information from multiple such genetic variants that affect our risk of developing certain diseases. Each variant is not very useful by itself, but if we combine the information from many — thousands or even millions of variants in some cases — we get useful and actionable information about disease risk.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the limitation of polygenic risk scores? How could they widen global health disparities?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Polygenic risk scores don't perform well across different genetic ancestry groups. Because the vast majority of genetic studies are done in people of European genetic ancestry, these scores don't work very well, for example, in people of African genetic ancestry. One way we can address that disparity is to increase diversity in our studies here in the U.S., but an even better approach may be to undertake a global effort, conducting this work in diverse regions across the globe. We know that using diverse sources of data will improve the performance of these scores for everybody.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You wrote that African datasets are still a high priority for genomic studies. Yet, they are the least represented — less than 2% of human genomes analyzed so far are of people with African genetic ancestry. How can studying African genomes help advance our understanding of the genomic basis of common diseases in all people?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Africa contains the greatest genetic diversity among the continents, accumulated over 300,000 years of human evolution. By studying people of African ancestry, we will learn so much more about human origins and genetics because we're all Africans, in a way — that's where Homo sapiens arose. That long evolutionary history means that African populations could yield more information about genetic variants associated with disease. And it's a chance to make up for this big disparity in the number of Africans in genomic studies thus far.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What steps do you believe are necessary to achieve equity in the availability of polygenic risk scores to improve global health?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> We certainly need to increase the representation of minorities in genomic studies. Mayo Clinic is part of a large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded consortium called <a href="https://emerge.study/mayo-clinic/">eMERGE</a> that is looking at polygenic risk scores for 10 common conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, breast cancer and prostate cancer. The consortium is committed to ensuring that at least half of the 25,000 participants across the country come from diverse groups.</p>



<p>It's important to learn about the spectrum of genetic variation in all of humanity, not just in one group. I believe that means going beyond our borders, helping other countries to set up infrastructure to generate their own genetic data and creating resources for data-sharing across the globe. It's not an easy task, but we have many elements in place, and I think it's doable.</p>

<p>When Roger Thomsen had his first episode several years ago, the 69-year-old retired repairman felt lightheaded. He checked his pulse. His heart rate was around 200 beats per minute. A typical pulse is 60 to 100.</p>



<p>"I told the wife, I said, 'I think we need to go to the doctor,'" Roger says.</p>



<p>Roger soon learned he has a heart condition called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ventricular-tachycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355138?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ventricular tachycardia</a>, also called V-tach or VT.</p>



<p>"Ventricular tachycardia is an abnormal rapid rhythm arising from the bottom chambers of the heart that can cause significant symptoms to patients," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/siontis-konstantinos-m-d/bio-20503925?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Konstantinos Siontis</a>, a Mayo Clinic electrophysiologist.</p>



<p>It can even be fatal. Essentially a short circuit caused by scar tissue on the heart, a common treatment for V-tach is a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ventricular-tachycardia-ablation/pyc-20385006?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">catheter ablation</a>. Doctors enter the heart through blood vessels using a catheter to create tiny scars with heat energy and block the irregular signals. Roger had several of these complex ablations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The symptoms came back. I was in the hospital a couple two, three times after that," Roger says.</p>



<p>So a couple of years ago, Roger enrolled in a clinical trial at Mayo Clinic. He would be one of the first of a handful of patients with V-tach to have a precise form of radiation typically used in cancer treatments, called proton beam therapy, used on the heart.</p>



<p>"Got nothing to lose. And the way it was, it wasn't working good," Roger says.</p>



<p>"Proton beam is a unique type of radiation that's actually a charged particle. It's able to deliver the energy of radiation at a specific depth or target in tissue without any exit dose beyond," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merrell-kenneth-w-m-d/bio-20434012">Dr. Kenneth Merrell</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist.</p>



<p>"With catheter ablation, there are certain areas within the heart that can be difficult to access," says Dr. Siontis.</p>



<p>And unlike a catheter ablation, proton beam therapy is completely noninvasive.</p>



<p>"The patient does not require anesthesia. They can walk into the treatment area and walk out the same day within about 30 minutes to an hour of completing the treatment," says Dr. Siontis.</p>



<p>It's nearly a year since Roger has had an abnormally rapid heart rhythm. </p>



<p>"It made it so it was working," Roger says. Which is the type of result the research team at Mayo says could bring new hope for some patients with V-tach.</p>



<p>"This was an encouraging first step," says Dr. Siontis. </p>



<p>While more study is needed, researchers are excited for the future. "Most likely, this will be another tool in the tool belt for us to use in patients," says Dr. Merrell.</p>



<p>The full results of the clinical trial using proton beam therapy to treat VT have yet to be published. The team at Mayo plans to present them later this year.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart failure during pregnancy is a dangerous and often under-detected condition because common symptoms – shortness of breath, extreme fatigue and trouble breathing while lying down – are easily mistaken for typical pregnancy discomforts. Late-breaking research presented at the <a href="https://esc365.escardio.org/ESC-Congress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Society of Cardiology Congress</a> on a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> study showed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital stethoscope helped doctors identify twice as many cases of heart failure compared to a control group that received usual obstetric care and screening. Full <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03243-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study findings are published in Nature Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>The trial was conducted in Nigeria, where more women experience pregnancy-related heart failure than anywhere in the world. The results also indicate that screening including the AI-enabled digital stethoscope were 12-times more likely than traditional screening to flag heart pump weakness when evaluated at an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/expert-answers/ejection-fraction/faq-20058286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ejection fraction</a> threshold lower than 45%, which is the cutoff indicating a specific type of heart failure called <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cardiomyopathy/what-is-cardiomyopathy-in-adults/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-ppcm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peripartum cardiomyopathy</a>.</p>



<p>"Recognizing this type of heart failure early is important to the mother's health and well-being," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20507418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demilade Adedinsewo, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and lead investigator of the study. "The symptoms of peripartum cardiomyopathy can get progressively worse as pregnancy advances, or more commonly following childbirth, and can endanger the mother's life if her heart becomes too weak. Medicines can help when the condition is identified but severe cases may require intensive care, a mechanical heart pump, or sometimes a heart transplant, if not controlled with medical therapy."</p>



<p>The randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial included nearly 1,200 participants who were screened for heart conditions through typical obstetric care or AI-enhanced solutions. Mayo Clinic researchers previously developed a foundational 12-lead AI-electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm to predict a weak heart pump, clinically known as low ejection fraction. A version of this algorithm was further enhanced by Eko Health for its point-of-care digital stethoscope which is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared to detect heart failure with low ejection fraction.</p>



<p>The researchers found that doctors using AI-based screening with the digital stethoscope and 12-lead ECG detected weak heart function with high accuracy. Within the study cohort, the digital stethoscope helped flag twice as many cases of low ejection fraction &lt;50% and doctors using it were 12-times more likely to identify an ejection fraction &lt;45% as compared to usual care.</p>



<p>The AI-supported tools were evaluated at three different levels of ejection fraction used in clinical diagnosis. Less than 45% is the cut point for diagnosing peripartum cardiomyopathy. Less than 40% indicates heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and has strong evidence in favor of specific medications to reduce symptoms and the risk of death. An ejection fraction of less than 35% signals severely low heart pump function that often requires more intense management, including advanced heart failure therapies and an implantable defibrillator if pump function does not recover. Patients in the intervention group each had an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a> at study entry to provide confirmation of the AI-predictions.</p>



<p>"This study provides evidence that we can better detect peripartum cardiomyopathy among women in Nigeria. However, there are more questions to be answered," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "Our next steps would be to evaluate usability and adoption of this tool by Nigerian healthcare providers (including doctors and nurses) and importantly, its impact on patient care. Peripartum cardiomyopathy affects approximately 1 in 2,000 women within the U.S. and as many as 1 in 700 African American women. Evaluating this AI tool in the U.S. will further test its abilities in varied populations and healthcare settings."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers are using artificial intelligence (AI) with an advanced 3D body-volume scanner – originally developed for the clothing industry – to help doctors predict metabolic syndrome risk and severity. The combination of tools offers doctors a more precise alternative to other measures of disease risk like body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio, according to findings published in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ehjdh?login=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Heart Journal - Digital Health</a>.</p>



<p>Metabolic syndrome can lead to heart attack, stroke and other serious health issues and affects over a third of the U.S. population and a quarter of people globally. The condition lacks widely accepted screening strategies. However, researchers found that using a 3D body volume scanner combined with imaging technology and Mayo Clinic-developed algorithms may help clinicians offer a more accurate method for identifying people who have the syndrome, as well as those at risk for developing it.</p>



<p>The effects of metabolic disease create hardship for patients. In addition to heart attack and stroke, people with metabolic syndrome are more likely to develop <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, cognitive disease and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver disease</a>. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed clinically when at least three of these five conditions are present: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol and high fasting blood sugar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"There is a need for a reliable, repeatable measure of metabolic syndrome risk and severity," says Betsy Medina Inojosa, M.D., a research fellow at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. "Body mass index measurements and bioimpedance scales that measure body fat and muscle are inaccurate for many people, and other types of scans are not widely available. Our research shows that this AI model may also be a tool to guide clinicians and patients to take action and seek outcomes that are a better fit for their metabolic health."</p>



<p>To develop the tool, researchers trained and validated an AI model on 1,280 volunteer subjects who underwent an evaluation that included 3D body-volume scans, standardized clinical questionnaires, blood tests and traditional body shape measurements. An extra 133 volunteers had front- and side-view images taken via a mobile app from Select Research called myBVI to further test the tool's ability to evaluate whether they had metabolic syndrome, and if so, how severe it was.</p>



<p>People with metabolic syndrome typically have apple-shaped bodies, meaning they carry a lot of their weight around the abdomen. The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome revolves around laboratory tests, blood pressure and body shape measurements, but there are no widely accepted routine screening strategies because these measurements are not always available or reproducible in the same way. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"This small study finds that digitally measuring a patient's body volume index with 3D imaging provides a highly accurate measurement of shapes and volumes in critical regions where unhealthy visceral fat is deposited, such as the abdomen and chest," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, director of Preventive Cardiology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and senior author of the study. "The scans also record the volume of hips, buttocks and legs – a measure related to muscle mass and 'healthy' fat. The 3D information about body volume in these key regions, whether from the large, stationary 3D scanner or from the mobile app, accurately flagged the presence and severity of metabolic syndrome using imaging instead of invasive tests. Looking ahead, the next steps will be to broaden the sample of research subjects to include more diversity."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic and the researchers have a financial interest in the technology referenced in this press release. Mayo Clinic will use any revenue it receives to support its not-for-profit mission in patient care, education and research.&nbsp;</p>

Health consequences can range from a higher risk of early death to long-term conditions that lower your quality of life. And it is not just the physical toll — the stigma around obesity can affect mental health.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shah-meera-m-b-ch-b/bio-20114165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Meera Shah</a>, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist who specializes in treating people with obesity, says understanding and addressing these interconnected health issues is crucial for improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p>"Our primary care colleagues spend a lot of time with their patients dealing with their blood pressure, and their cholesterol and their arthritis, sleep apnea, and urinary incontinence and diabetes," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>She says it's important to step back to look at what these health issues have in common.</p>



<p>"What kind of unites all of those things? It's obesity," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is obesity?</h2>



<p>"There are many ways of defining obesity, but ultimately, it's a condition of excess adiposity – too many fat cells," explains Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>And carrying extra weight increases your risk of certain hormonal cancers such as breast and endometrial cancer.</p>



<p>"It is also a risk factor for certain GI cancers, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer&nbsp;—&nbsp;numerous cancers. And we don't always know why but the link between obesity and cancers is clear," Dr. Shah says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;As obesity rates increase, the reasons are not always clear-cut.</p>

But you don't need to spend money on new office equipment to achieve the benefits of an active workstation.</p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-20053705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, explains the concept of "activity snacks" and how they can be incorporated into just about anyone's daily routine.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:10) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/SCRIPT-MCM-Activity-snacks-SCRIPT-SME-reviewed-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Sitting at a desk for hours at a time may make some feel exhausted and unmotivated. If that's ever happened to you, it may be time for a snack … an activity snack.</p>



<p>The concept is simple, after sitting for an hour, take two to three minutes to get up and move your body.</p>



<p>"You break this sedentary status of your body by going to take the stairs for two or three flights, or just do some push-ups or do something that is meaningful in terms of activity for just a few minutes, and then come back and continue your work," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>In a way, Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says those two to three minutes reset your metabolic clock.</p>



<p>"It has been impressive, the biological changes those activity snacks can induce in your cells, in the metabolism of the sugar, in the metabolism of the cholesterol, just by having those little episodes of activity, even though you might be sitting down for the next 45 minutes," he says.</p>



<p>It's a small change that can make a big impact on your physical and mental health.</p>



<p>"You will see how that little thing will even sharpen your mind for the next half an hour, 45 minutes, absolutely," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Cardiologists in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/heart-rhythm-clinic/overview/ovc-20442477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart Rhythm Clinic</a> are using a new innovative energy source to safely and successfully treat a common type of heart arrhythmia. The therapy, called pulsed field ablation (PFA), has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and represents a significant milestone in treating <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a> (AFib).</p>



<p>The irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm of AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart, increasing a patient's risk of stroke. Clinicians can use medication and therapies to help reset the heart rhythm, but some patients have AFib that persists and worsens. Ablation therapy has been used for about two decades to treat these patients, but pulsed field ablation uses a different approach.</p>



<p>Instead of applying heat or cold energy as in traditional ablation, the PFA catheter therapy uses short bursts of high energy called irreversible electroporation to affect heart tissue that causes atrial fibrillation. The PFA therapy successfully transitioned to patient care at Mayo Clinic in Rochester in February 2024. Mayo cardiac specialists have since used PFA to treat more than 200 patients for AFib.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Limitations inspired development of new energy sources</h2>



<p>"The traditional approaches using thermal energy sources to treat AFib — radiofrequency, laser, cryo energy — all carry an associated injury risk to nearby structures, the esophagus and the phrenic nerve," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kapa-suraj-m-d/bio-20055752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suraj Kapa, M.D.</a>, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PFA technology has been in development for more than 18 years. Mayo Clinic's pioneering research in ablative therapy began under another cardiac electrophysiologist and prolific inventor, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/asirvatham-samuel-j-m-d/bio-20053066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel J. Asirvatham, M.D.</a> He had a growing interest in developing novel energy sources that would allow for cardiac-selective impact.</p>



<p>"The principle underlying PFA is that, depending on the makeup of the cell membranes of different types of tissues, certain tissue may have different energy thresholds that may be 'deadened' or ablated while other tissue types may be preserved," says Dr. Kapa. "Research through hundreds of preclinical trials has suggested that PFA of the heart tissue can allow for a heart tissue-specific approach to ablation while avoiding collateral injury to structures such as the esophagus or the phrenic nerve."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research led to the development of two recently U.S.-approved systems to deliver pulsed field energy to the heart. Dr. Kapa notes that both catheters are approved to treat AFib in the form of pulmonary vein isolation and have shown similar efficacy in clinical trials when compared with traditional radiofrequency ablation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of pulsed field ablation</h2>



<p>PFA can lead to faster procedures while reducing anesthesia time and removing some of the risks of traditional AFib ablation.</p>



<p>"Minimizing risk and making potentially effective treatments more broadly available is critical to providing therapy to the largest number of patients," says Dr. Kapa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is estimated that 12.1 million people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AFib by 2030 — more than double the number in 2010. Globally, the number of patients diagnosed with AFib is increasing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"A growing body of evidence supports more aggressive rhythm control with ablation, whether earlier in a patient's AFib diagnosis to achieve better long-term outcomes or in the setting of other comorbidities such as heart failure, in which ablation has shown to reduce mortality," says Dr. Kapa.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Assessing how PFA may be used for other arrhythmias, such as ventricular arrhythmias, is in the works. Early preclinical data suggest that PFA may be superior to current traditional thermal energy-based approaches in this arena. Looking ahead, Dr. Kapa anticipates rapid growth and evolution in pulsed field therapy.</p>



<p>"Within the next year, we expect the introduction of at least a half dozen catheters and systems utilizing pulsed field therapy, each offering new research opportunities and the potential to provide transformative, curative care for patients with arrhythmic diseases."&nbsp;</p>
