<p><em>October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>JACKSONVILLE, Florida — There are two surgical options to treat <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumpectomy/about/pac-20394650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lumpectomy</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mastectomy</a>. But there are many more reasons why women choose one over another, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mclaughlin-sarah-a-m-d/bio-20055048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah McLaughlin, M.D.</a>, a breast surgical oncologist and chair of the Department of Surgery at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/international" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Dr.-Sarah-McLaughlin-3x4-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395256" style="width:256px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Dr.-Sarah-McLaughlin-3x4-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Dr.-Sarah-McLaughlin-3x4-1.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sarah McLaughlin, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Some of that can be cancer-based, some of it can be family history and genetic, some of it can be personal peace of mind," Dr. McLaughlin explains.</p>



<p>More than 2 million women&nbsp;are diagnosed with breast cancer every year, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Health Organization</a>. Advances in&nbsp;treatment including surgical innovations are helping women and their healthcare teams personalize care and improve quality of life.</p>



<p>Breast cancer treatment involves a surgery to remove the cancer from the breast. It’s often used with other treatments, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy-for-breast-cancer/about/pac-20384940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation therapy</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy-for-breast-cancer/about/pac-20384931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hormone-therapy-for-breast-cancer/about/pac-20384943#:~:text=Hormone%20therapy%20for%20breast%20cancer%20is%20only%20used,called%20estrogen%20receptor%20positive%2C%20also%20called%20ER%20positive." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hormone therapy</a> and <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/06/07/using-targeted-therapy-to-treat-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted therapy</a>. Surgery may also be used to reduce the risk of future cancer.</p>



<p>Surgical options include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lumpectomy: Removing cancerous tissue and the surrounding margin of normal breast tissue.</li>



<li>Mastectomy: Removing the entire breast.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sentinel-node-biopsy/about/pac-20385264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sentinel lymph node biopsy</a>: Removing a few lymph nodes to check whether cancer has spread to them.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/sentinel-lymph-node-axillary-lymph-node-procedures-for-breast-cancer-at-mayo-clinic/vid-20535475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axillary lymph node dissection</a>: removing more lymph nodes from under the arm if there is many sentinel lymph nodes with cancer in them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Reconstructive surgery: <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/07/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-options-for-breast-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breast reconstruction</a> following a mastectomy rebuilds the breast.</li>
</ul>



<p>The approaches to all of these options are evolving as knowledge grows. For example, decades of research have shown similar long-term survival rates for lumpectomies and mastectomies, Dr. McLaughlin explains.</p>



<p>"If you don't need a mastectomy, you wouldn’t do better or live longer because you have one,” &nbsp;Dr. McLaughlin says.</p>



<p>Some patients no longer need lymph nodes under the armpit removed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contemporary mastectomy techniques focus on removing less skin and preserving the nipple and areola when possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In oncoplastic surgery for lumpectomies, surgeons place incisions remote from the actual site of cancer and, after removing cancerous tissue, rearrange the breast tissue that remains to maintain a cosmetically acceptable breast, Dr. McLaughlin says.</p>



<p>Dr. McLaughlin’s research focuses on improving the quality of life for breast cancer survivors. She is contributing to the establishment of a breast organoid biobank at Mayo Clinic using excess breast tissue from volunteers to speed research.</p>



<p>“Breast cancer patients are living longer and longer and longer, so issues of survivorship are becoming much more important,” Dr. McLaughlin says.</p>



<p>One significant issue for breast cancer survivors who have had lymph nodes removed can be <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphedema/symptoms-causes/syc-20374682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymphedema</a>, tissue swelling caused by an accumulation of fluid that usually is removed by lymph nodes. Lymphedema can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe, including discomfort, swelling, a feeling of tightness or heaviness, limited range of motion, recurring infections and hardened skin.</p>



<p>Dr. McLaughlin’s work includes studies to predict, prevent and improve treatment of lymphedema, including identifying biomarkers and developing tailored treatment strategies.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of current focus on techniques to reduce the risk of developing lymphedema,” she explains.</p>



<p>Those techniques include axillary reverse mapping, which maps the lymph nodes that drain the arm, separating them from those that drain the breast, allowing the surgeon to remove only those that drain the breast. Another option is reconstructing the lymphatic system if there is extensive lymph node removal.</p>



<p>Lymphedema can be debilitating and a chronic reminder of the cancer treatment, &nbsp;Dr. McLaughlin says.</p>



<p>“The intense focus on management and therapy related to it becomes time-consuming, expensive and painful for patients to manage,” she adds. “We want to try to reduce that as much as possible.”</p>



<p>It's important to work with your healthcare team to determine what treatments are best for you. Considerations may include the stage of cancer, your personal preferences and overall health.</p>



<p>“Our goal is to do as little as possible while achieving the highest level of success, which is long- term survival,” Dr. McLaughlin says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My mother and sister were both diagnosed with breast cancer. With my family history, when should I consider preventive surgery options, and what do those look like? Are there other risk factors I should be aware of?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Given your family history of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>, I'm so glad you want to know more about reducing breast cancer risk. There are a number of ways you can reduce your risk of getting breast cancer. These can be with surgery, such as a bilateral or double mastectomy, but also with less invasive methods such as healthy lifestyle choices and medication. </p>



<p>An important first step when considering the prevention of breast cancer is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-cancer-risk-assessment/about/pac-20393195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understanding your personal risk</a>. If you have not yet, I would recommend establishing care with a breast health specialist, or healthcare professional comfortable with breast cancer risk prediction counseling. This may be at a dedicated breast clinic, like the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/breast-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20459469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Breast Clinic</a>, or with your primary care clinician or OB-GYN. There are an increasing number of programs specifically created for people at high risk for breast cancer, and the healthcare team uses multiple prediction tools to identify your personal risk. Many factors, including age, hormone-related life events such as age of first period, pregnancy and breastfeeding, and prior breast imaging contribute to an individual’s risk. </p>



<p>Genetic counseling is also an important part of determining your personal risk and the benefit you would receive from risk-reducing medication or surgery. I would ask if either your mother or sister has undergone genetic testing and if they are comfortable sharing those results. If not, a genetic counselor will talk through your family tree and ask about each relative and what cancer(s), if any, each relative has had and their age when they developed cancer to help assess your risk. If appropriate, genetic testing will be offered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you know your personal risk of breast cancer, then it is important to discuss both screening and prevention, meaning what you can do to decrease that risk and by how much. Breast clinics and high-risk programs provide recommendations on what type of enhanced screening you should have in the future. Often tests such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-mri/about/pac-20384809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast MRI</a> are offered in addition to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traditional mammograms</a>. Your age, risk and characteristics of your breast tissue, such as density, are combined to create a personalized screening plan. </p>



<p>In terms of action items to decrease the risk of breast cancer, we know that a healthy lifestyle can decrease a woman's risk of developing breast cancer or of it coming back after a prior diagnosis. All of us can benefit from being active, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking and limiting alcohol use. Newer data suggests we need both cardio-based and weightlifting each week to get the most benefit.</p>



<p>There are certain medications that can be taken to reduce a person's risk of breast cancer. These can reduce your personal risk by 50%-70% and are taken daily for multiple years to see that benefit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Risk-reducing surgery, such as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bilateral mastectomy</a>, decreases the chance of getting breast cancer; surgery decreases your personal risk by about 90%-95%. And while extremely effective, not even surgery can completely eliminate the risk of breast cancer. It is important to note that bilateral mastectomy is a permanent change to your body, including appearance and sensation, and the impact on your quality of life, sex life and body image should all be carefully discussed before having surgery. </p>



<p>Risk-reducing surgery can be performed with or without reconstruction. A bilateral total mastectomy removes both breasts without reconstruction and leaves a flat chest wall. You can wear a prosthesis, and prostheses are also available for swimming suits. Breast reconstruction is also a great option for many women, and the process often can be started at the time of the mastectomy. A skin-sparing mastectomy can be performed which preserves the skin envelope of the breast. Nipple-sparing mastectomy is also an option for some women and preserves the skin envelope and the nipple-areola complex. Generally, however, while the nipple is preserved, the sensation is lost from the nipple with a nipple-sparing mastectomy. Newer techniques, including a robotic-assisted approach to nipple-sparing mastectomy, are currently being evaluated.</p>



<p>I would recommend meeting with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/breast-melanoma-surgical-oncology/sections/overview/ovc-20535267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast surgical oncologist</a> and a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/plastic-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20473067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reconstructive plastic surgeon</a> to discuss options further.</p>



<p>It's important to note that the decision to take medication or have surgery to reduce your risk of breast cancer is personal. It also is a fluid decision and may change over time. Factors such as menopausal status, desire to have children, and family and work obligations are all important to consider when making these decisions. I'd recommend discussing all these parts of life with your healthcare team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I commend you for being proactive and exploring your options to reduce your risk of breast cancer. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mrdutt-mary-m-m-d-m-s/bio-20523392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mary Mrdutt, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Breast and Melanoma Surgical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>Patients with breast cancer now have more options when it comes to radiation treatments. The goal is to remove any remaining cancer cells following chemotherapy or surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"In other situations, we use radiation if the cancer is more advanced, or spread to the lymph nodes," says Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>Advancements in technology allow healthcare professionals to treat patients more safely. One technique called "prone positioning" reduces the chance of beams targeting other organs. For this procedure, patients lie on their stomachs.</p>

<p>"We take advantage of gravity, the breast pulls away from the body, and we can treat the breast without exposing the underlying lung and heart to unnecessary radiation," explains Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is cutting-edge. Unlike traditional radiation, this procedure delivers X-rays directly to the targeted area from multiple angles, allowing for higher, more effective doses.</p>



<p>"Before intensity-modulated radiation therapy, we were not able to conform the dose around the chest wall," says Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>For patients undergoing radiation therapy, it's crucial to stay hydrated and try to sleep well to fight fatigue. It's also important to use sunscreen after treatment.</p>

<p>Blink and you'll miss Cheryl Robinson going in and out of rooms and preparing each for patients. Her speed is matched by her dedication as a volunteer and the compassion shown toward those seeking care on the Hematology/Oncology floor in Florida.</p>



<p>A former commercial insurance professional, Cheryl’s journey took a heartfelt turn when she became a caregiver to her husband, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/back-to-the-drawing-table-thanks-to-individualized-care-for-blood-cancer/">Jim Robinson</a>. Their love story, rooted in shared struggles and triumphs, inspired Cheryl’s commitment to volunteerism at Mayo Clinic, where Jim once received his care.</p>



<p>"I just remember walking into the clinic the first time and thinking, 'Wow, when I retire, I want to volunteer at Mayo and wear that smock,'" says Cheryl.</p>



<p>Cheryl and Jim’s bond was fortified through adversity. Jim, who bravely navigated the challenges of global aphasia and leukemia, found solace and expression in drawing. His artwork became a symbol of hope for Cheryl, who supported him unwaveringly. The couple’s daily routine, punctuated by Jim’s 7 a.m. drawing sessions, was a testament to their resilience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Volunteering at Mayo Clinic</h2>



<p>The loss of Jim in the fall of 2023 left a void in Cheryl’s life, but it also planted the seeds of a new purpose. After retiring in January 2024, she followed her dream and became a Mayo Clinic volunteer.</p>



<p>"Going to work was an outlet for me, and being a caretaker gave me a feeling of being appreciated,” says Cheryl. "I knew I needed those things in my life, so to find that volunteering at Mayo Clinic has been fulfilling."</p>



<p>Cheryl’s presence on Mangurian 3, where she volunteers four hours weekly, is more than just a helping hand; it’s a legacy in the making. Her tasks are straightforward yet vital: prepping rooms, stocking supplies and cleaning. These actions are reminiscent of the care she saw while taking Jim to appointments.</p>



<p>"Over the years, I would see Cheryl with her husband while he went through treatment for leukemia, then follow-ups when he went into remission," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ailawadhi-sikander-m-d/bio-20087330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sikander Ailawadhi, M.D.</a>, Hematology/Oncology. "I've seen Cheryl transform from her husband's caretaker to really providing care and service to our patients and staff. It's a remarkable and selfless gift."</p>



<p>Staff recognize her dedication, and she finds joy in the difference she makes, honoring Jim’s memory and serving others. As she moves through Mayo Clinic, memories of Jim, especially her interactions with his former care team members, stir deep emotions and strengthen her resolve to serve.</p>

<p>Gynecologic exams might not top the list of things you look forward to, but whether it's for a wellness visit or a new concern, such exams are critical for detecting gynecologic cancers early when they are most treatable. Gynecologic cancers include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endometrial</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vulvar-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20368051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vulvar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vaginal cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Gynecology visits should provide a valuable opportunity for you to ask questions, raise concerns and learn about your body from an expert who prioritizes your health and well-being. But if you've had difficulty getting answers, accessing the care you need or your experiences haven't been positive, these visits can cause some anxiety.</p>



<p>Learning how to advocate for your gynecologic health might help you feel more prepared for your next appointment, says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/butler-kristina-a-m-d-m-s/bio-20110364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristina Butler, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gynecologic oncologist. This is what she wants you to know:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You deserve a trusting relationship with your gynecologist.</h2>



<p>Trust is a critical part of the patient-clinician relationship. It allows you to have frank and open discussions with your gynecologist and alert them to significant details that might affect your care.</p>



<p>"Gynecologic cancers are difficult to talk about because they involve parts of the body that we don't routinely discuss with other people," says Dr. Butler. "It can be difficult for a patient to bring up, for example, that they have pain in their vulva."</p>



<p>If you don't feel comfortable or confident expressing concerns like these to your gynecologist, there's a risk that serious conditions like gynecologic cancers could be missed. If you don't feel heard, Dr. Butler says it's OK to look for someone who is a better fit for your needs. Recommendations from friends and family can often be a good starting point.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You are the expert on your body.</h2>



<p>When changes happen in your body, you might be the first — and often the only one — to notice. Informing your gynecologist of these changes helps them gain a more accurate understanding of your health and alerts them to anything that might require additional examination.</p>



<p>As life gets busy, it can be easy to overlook or dismiss certain changes, but Dr. Butler stresses the importance of being in tune with your body. "This means understanding what's normal for you. That can be difficult because everyone's 'normal' is a little bit different," she says. "If something is repetitive and doesn't feel right, it's important to talk about it."</p>



<p>While each gynecologic cancer has symptoms associated with it, some symptoms overlap. If you're experiencing any symptoms associated with gynecologic cancer, Dr. Butler says it's important to talk to a clinician who specializes in gynecologic health, especially if you don't feel your questions have been answered by your primary care physician. "Many gynecologic cancers have vague symptoms. Often, patients share symptoms with a provider who isn't a gynecologist, but it's important that they voice their concerns to multiple providers until they get the answers they need to know that they're safe," she says.</p>



<p>Symptoms you should always discuss with your healthcare professional include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Abnormal vaginal bleeding:</strong> Bleeding between periods, prolonged bleeding or any bleeding that occurs after menopause.</li>



<li><strong>Pelvic pain or discomfort: </strong>Pain or pressure in your pelvic area — the area of the body below the abdomen located between the hip bones.</li>



<li><strong>Early satiety: </strong>Feeling full after eating a small amount of food.</li>



<li><strong>Vulvar discomfort or itching: </strong>Pain, discomfort or itching in the vulva, which includes all the structures that make up the exterior genitals.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Many providers care for the pelvic area, and this can begin with your primary care physician, but may also progress to a gynecologist, urologist or gastroenterologist," adds Dr. Butler. "We can collaborate together for your best outcome."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You have the right to be informed about your health.</h2>



<p>Staying informed about your health can help you relay information to your healthcare professional and better prepare for appointments. Dr. Butler says you can do this in various ways.</p>



<p>"It's always helpful for patients to have a timeline. I am a proponent of having lists — lists of medications, surgeries, diagnoses and family history, which is tremendously important. All of this is lengthy and can be confusing or forgotten so keeping a timeline and a list of these things can help focus the visit," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>Dr. Butler recommends you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthit.gov/how-to-get-your-health-record/get-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take ownership of your medical records</a>&nbsp;so you can share them with your healthcare team. "Your healthcare information — reports, pathology, surgical information, radiology imaging including discs of viewable pictures — you own that. You are allowed to have access to that information through medical record departments. It's your right, and I empower patients to keep those for themselves and carry these items with you on your visits."</p>



<p>As you seek to learn more about your health, Dr. Butler says it's important to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/healthy-aging/how-find-reliable-health-information-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find reliable health information</a>. "Access to the internet is tremendously valuable for educating ourselves. However, we have to be careful about the resources from which we obtain information. Websites and blogs with inaccurate or completely false information can be anxiety-provoking and sometimes dangerous."</p>



<p>Dr. Butler recommends starting with these sites:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.nccn.org/patientresources/patient-resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/obstetrics-gynecology/sections/conditions-treated/orc-20423744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.cancer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You are allowed to ask for a second opinion.</h2>



<p>You have the right to seek a second opinion, and, Dr. Butler says, your gynecologist should never discourage you from doing so. "I find it concerning when a provider is bothered by a second opinion because patients have a right to formulate the best decision for themselves," she says.</p>



<p>You might wish to seek a second opinion for many reasons, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You feel your symptoms have been dismissed.</li>



<li>You are unclear on your diagnosis.</li>



<li>You are unsure of your treatment options.</li>



<li>You don't feel comfortable with the treatments recommended.</li>



<li>You have unanswered questions.</li>



<li>You don't feel you can trust your physician.</li>
</ul>



<p>Regardless of your reason, it's your choice and part of your right to advocate for yourself. "I encourage my patients to ask for second opinions because it's the best way to know that they're making the right decision for themselves," says Dr. Butler.</p>

<p>Cancer is a leading cause of death among Hispanic people in the U.S., according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/hispanics-latinos-facts-figures.html">American Cancer Society</a>.

<p>Early detection through screening can prevent serious health issues.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246">Dr. Jesse Bracamonte</a>, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, stresses the need for healthcare workers to discuss the importance of health screenings with patients, especially in&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-health-disparities-in-gynecologic-cancers/">underserved communities</a>.</p>

<p>"Educating underrepresented groups is very important to prevent cancer," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says some groups of people, including those in the Hispanic community, have higher rates of disease because they may not be getting the proper screenings.</p>



<p>"<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-who-should-be-screened-for-colorectal-cancer-2/">Colon cancer screening,</a>&nbsp;breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, screening for heart disease are all very important because those things are very predominant in our culture, in our society, and if caught early, it can be prevented," Dr. Bracamonte explains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Health screenings</h2>



<p>The type of health screening depends on a person's age and gender.</p>



<p>"For example, colorectal cancer screening is, at age 45, looking for colon cancer. Cervical cancer screenings, such as Pap tests, we start at 21 in females," he says.</p>



<p>Breast cancer screening is recommended to start at age 40, and regular blood pressure checks can help monitor overall health.</p>

<p>"One of the most important things that you can do is see your clinician, minimum, probably once a year, based on your age level, which is really important to stay healthy and stay out of the doctor’s office," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<p>October is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breast Cancer</a> Awareness Month. Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in women across the U.S. And rates of the disease continue to climb, notably among younger women. A recent report from the American Cancer Society calculates that 1 in 50 women will develop invasive breast cancer by the age of 50.</p>



<p>Early detection through screening can lead to more treatable and curable breast cancers. In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/cathcart-rake-elizabeth-j-m-d/bio-20558812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Elizabeth Cathcart-Rake</a> clears up confusion about who should be screened and when.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:06) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/MCM-BC-Screening-SCRIPT-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic recommends regular <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer screenings</a> start at age 40. However, it's not a one-size-fits-all decision.</p>



<p>Dr. Cathcart-Rake says these decisions should be individualized because some people may benefit from screening earlier.</p>



<p>"Based on personal history of either breast cancer or a pre-invasive type of cancer in the breast (or another lesion in the breast that increases risk – things like atypical ductal hyperplasia), a strong family history, a genetic predisposition to breast cancer or chest radiation prior to the age of 30," she says.</p>



<p>The standard screening at Mayo Clinic is a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/3d-mammogram/about/pac-20438708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3D mammogram</a>, but self-exams are crucial to notice any new or persistent changes in the breasts or chest wall.</p>

<p>"If you feel a lump, especially a hard lump that doesn't move very easily, that's persistent over the course of weeks and seems to only be stable or even getting worse, that's absolutely a reason to come in. And I always tell folks and tell my patients that if it's something that's bothering you, I want to know about it," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<p>She says it's important to discuss with care team your individual risk and what breast cancer screening decisions are right for you. Early detection helps people live longer.</p>



<p>"We know 1 in 8 women get breast cancer. That is common. This is, unfortunately, a common disease. And so it's really important that no matter what your family history is or your personal history is, that you still be thinking about breast cancer screening," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I understand surgery is often included as part of the treatment plan for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>. If I'm a candidate for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumpectomy/about/pac-20394650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lumpectomy</a> but am also considering a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mastectomy</a>, what are some things I should keep in mind? Should my breast density be a factor in my decision-making?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Women diagnosed with breast cancer are almost immediately confronted with treatment decisions. If your&nbsp;surgical oncologist&nbsp;gave you a choice between a lumpectomy and a mastectomy to remove a tumor, that's often because either option will lead to a similar long-term health outcome.</p>



<p>A lumpectomy is commonly known as breast conservation surgery because it keeps most of the breast intact, whereas a mastectomy removes the entire breast.&nbsp;Regardless of which procedure you choose, the risk of breast cancer recurrence is roughly the same.</p>



<p>Lumpectomy is a treatment option for early-stage breast cancer.&nbsp;Compared with a mastectomy, it's less invasive and tends to have a quicker recovery. It also can help preserve the cosmetic appearance and sensation of the breast. Your healthcare professional will recommend radiation therapy after a lumpectomy to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning in the breast.</p>



<p>A mastectomy removes the whole breast. In many cases, radiation therapy is not needed after mastectomy. Individuals&nbsp;with a genetic predisposition for breast cancer, such as the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, may opt for a mastectomy as a preventive measure following their diagnosis.</p>



<p>After a mastectomy, some women choose to forgo <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-reconstruction-implants/about/pac-20384934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reconstructive surgery</a>, opting for what is called an aesthetic flat closure. There can be many reasons for this, including wanting to limit future surgeries, reducing risks and complications, and desiring a faster return to daily life and activities.</p>



<p>For other patients, having a breast mound is part of how they identify as women. Multiple types of breast reconstruction procedures are available following either a lumpectomy or mastectomy. Breast reconstruction surgery can occur at the same time as breast cancer surgery, or you can plan your reconstruction weeks, months or years after treatment.</p>



<p>The surgical technique and cosmetic outcomes after mastectomy and reconstruction have improved over the past 20 years. More women can keep their nipple and areolar complex and, in many cases, a procedure can be performed to help improve sensation to the nipple and areolar complex.<br><br>Breast density also could be a factor in your decision-making. About half of people who have screening <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammograms</a> have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/in-depth/dense-breast-tissue/art-20123968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense breasts</a>. Dense breast tissue is harder to see through on a mammogram image. Having dense breast tissue should not affect one's decision to undergo a mastectomy or lumpectomy.</p>



<p>However, dense breast tissue may influence the need for additional tests before surgery, such as an MRI. An MRI looks for abnormal blood flow within the breast and can "see through" dense tissue. This may help surgeons better determine the extent of disease and guide them in the removal.</p>



<p>Ultimately, determining the option that is best for you is a nuanced decision that can be based on a variety of factors, including cancer-based reasons, family history and genetics, and peace of mind. Choosing which surgical route to take is deeply personal, and there is no one "best choice" for every woman. After careful consideration and consultation with your healthcare team, you should make the decision that you determine is best for you, based on the specifics of your cancer and your individual needs and preferences. <strong>— </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mclaughlin-sarah-a-m-d/bio-20055048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Sarah McLaughlin, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Surgical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

<p>Uterine cancer is the most common type of gynecologic cancer. It's estimated that about 67,880 new cases will be diagnosed in 2024. Approximately 13,250 people will die from this disease in the U.S. in 2024, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/corp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2792010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Researchers recently reported</a>&nbsp;that while death rates for the most common type of uterine cancer — endometrioid cancer — remained stable, deaths from rare and aggressive types of uterine cancer increased significantly each year from 2010 to 2017. The study also revealed a disproportionate increase in uterine cancer deaths among the Hispanic, Black and Asian communities.</p>



<p>Although uterine cancer can't be fully prevented, and there is no standard screening for it, an annual pelvic examination is recommended.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/butler-kristina-a-m-d-m-s/bio-20110364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristina Butler, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic gynecologic oncologist, explains what you need to know to stay vigilant and reduce your risk:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understand uterine cancer types and how they develop.</h2>



<p>Like other cancers, uterine cancer can develop when mutations happen in the DNA cells of your uterus and endometrium, also called the endometrial lining. Sometimes, these mutations can turn normal, healthy cells into abnormal cells that grow and multiply uncontrollably and invade nearby tissues.</p>



<p>When this happens, two main types of cancer can develop:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Endometrial cancer</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endometrial cancer</a>&nbsp;starts in the endometrium. This is the most common type of uterine cancer, and it can often be cured when detected early. Endometrioid cancer is a type of endometrial cancer that starts in gland cells.</li>



<li><strong>Uterine sarcoma</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leiomyosarcoma/cdc-20387733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uterine sarcoma</a>&nbsp;starts in the muscles and supporting tissues of the uterus. It is much less common but usually more aggressive.</li>
</ul>



<p>Both types of uterine cancer also have more aggressive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/endometrial-cancer/about/what-is-endometrial-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subtypes</a>.</p>



<p>Changes in the balance of hormones also can be a risk factor for uterine cancer.</p>



<p>Estrogen and progesterone regulate changes in the endometrium that are part of the monthly menstrual cycle. When estrogen increases but progesterone does not, the risk of endometrial cancer can increase. This can occur with obesity because fat cells increase estrogen without progesterone, which functions to keep the uterus cancer-free.</p>



<p>Certain medications and conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome and obesity, or changes such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a>, also can affect your estrogen levels.</p>



<p>"With age, menopause quiets the uterus, but that's when we notice the increased incidence of uterine cancer because abnormal mutations can happen," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Watch for abnormal vaginal bleeding and other symptoms.</h2>



<p>Dr. Butler says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/vaginal-bleeding/basics/definition/sym-20050756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abnormal vaginal bleeding</a>&nbsp;can be a sign of uterine cancer. If you've gone through menopause and no longer have a monthly menstrual cycle, any amount of blood is considered abnormal. "If you have any bleeding after menopause, it's so important to get checked out quickly," she adds.</p>



<p>For younger people who haven't gone through menopause, abnormal bleeding can include bleeding between your menstrual cycles or after sex, and prolonged or heavy bleeding.</p>



<p>Though in many cases abnormal bleeding can be attributed to noncancerous conditions, it's best to talk to your health care professional if you notice changes in your cycle that are out of the ordinary for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Improve your lifestyle choices.</h2>



<p>You can reduce some of the known risks of uterine cancer by improving your diet, exercising and maintaining a healthy weight.</p>



<p>"We are seeing a rise in diagnoses of uterine cancer, and we think this is because there's also a rise in other conditions and diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/womens-wellness-obesity-increases-endometrial-cancer-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Obesity</a>&nbsp;increases your risk of uterine cancer because extra weight can affect your menstrual cycle.</p>



<p>"In younger obese people, menses may not occur regularly, which allows thickening, and cancer can develop," she says.</p>



<p>If you need support in reaching your health goals, be sure to talk to your health care professional about support and resources that might be available to you, and learn about how a healthy diet can help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/how-plant-based-food-helps-fight-cancer/art-20457590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduce cancer risk</a>. Also, taking a birth control pill can lower the risk of uterine cancer by 50%.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Discuss your risk factors with a health care professional you trust.</h2>



<p>Awareness of your risk factors for uterine cancer can help you and your health care professional stay ahead of this type of cancer. Although factors like age, family history and certain health conditions might not be in your control, they can help your health care professional decide if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testing for uterine cancer</a>&nbsp;is right for you.</p>



<p>If they apply to you, consider discussing these risk factors with your health care professional:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You have inherited conditions linked to higher cancer risk.</li>



<li>You have an excessive amount of body fat.</li>



<li>You started menstruation before the age of 12.</li>



<li>You went through menopause later in life.</li>



<li>You have never been pregnant.</li>



<li>You've had radiation therapy to the pelvis for cancer.</li>



<li>You've had estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy after menopause.</li>



<li>You've taken the drug tamoxifen for breast cancer.</li>
</ul>



<p>Though endometrial cancer isn't usually an inherited disease, familial conditions like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>&nbsp;can increase your risk of developing it. If you don't know your family history, consider talking to a&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/08/03/dear-mayo-clinic-what-is-the-benefit-of-visiting-a-genetic-counselor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic counselor</a>&nbsp;to learn more about your personal risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Butler says it's also important to find a health care professional you trust who makes you feel heard.</p>



<p>"Finding someone you feel comfortable with is key because you have to have open communication," she says. "You should feel safe talking with them and having those intimate discussions."</p>



<p>If you are diagnosed with uterine cancer, Dr. Butler says you should try to seek care from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/infrastructure/cancer-centers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers</a>.</p>



<p>"We know that people have improved outcomes when they go to these centers, because they follow guidelines and provide the best evidence-based care for women," she says.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>As cancer experts work to learn more about uterine cancer and better screening, Dr. Butler says the most important thing you can do is stay up to date on your annual screenings, listen to your body and advocate for yourself if something isn't normal.</p>



<p>When it comes to abnormal bleeding, her advice is straightforward: "Don't ignore it. It can be the first sign that something abnormal is happening and can help us detect uterine cancer early."</p>

<p>Breast cancer receives much attention during October's awareness month. Although sightings of pink ribbons and breast cancer-related information increase during the month, it's crucial to keep screenings and clinical breast exams at the forefront of preventive care year-round.</p>



<p>A Mayo Clinic Health System high-risk breast consultant and breast cancer awareness advocate shares the top&nbsp;10 questions about breast cancer asked by people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Why do I need to worry about breast cancer and having routine mammograms?</strong><br>This is the most common question shared during breast clinic consultations. Many people mention that they don't have any family history of breast cancer. However, approximately just 20% of breast cancer is related to family history and genetic links. People are considered at the highest risk after a breast cancer diagnosis in a first-degree relative, such as a mom or sister.</li>



<li><strong>What can I do to prevent breast cancer from developing?</strong><br>For most people, the answer is to live a healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, minimizing alcohol consumption and maintaining an ideal body weight through diet and exercise. The majority of the risk for breast cancer comes from being female, having breasts and aging.</li>



<li><strong>What steps can I take to be informed of my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>This answer has two parts. The first part is to learn about your family's medical history. The second part is to follow your healthcare team's recommended preventive screening plan, including a mammogram if necessary.</li>



<li><strong>Should I continue doing self-checks of my breasts and have an annual clinical breast exam?</strong><br>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Preventive Services Taskforce update breast screening recommendations annually, but more research studies need to be done. Your health history and conversations with your healthcare team will help inform the best approach for you. Although not all healthcare professionals perform a yearly clinical breast exam as part of an annual physical, you may choose to perform monthly or quarterly self-checks to increase your breast awareness. Both a yearly breast exam by a medical professional and regular self-checks are recommended if you have a higher risk of breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>What does it mean to have dense breasts, and how does that affect mammograms?</strong><br>Approximately 30% of people have moderately dense breasts and up to 10% have extremely dense breasts. While dense breast tissue does affect the detection of breast cancer through mammography, a mammogram is still a recommended annual screening starting at age 40 for people with average breast cancer risk.</li>



<li><strong>Does taking a birth control pill increase my risk of developing breast cancer?<br></strong>No strong connection has been identified to suggest any such connection in average-risk patients during childbearing years. However, studies suggest that continuing hormone therapy after age 60 can increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Does pregnancy and breastfeeding increase my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>No, it's quite the opposite. The risk of developing breast cancer decreases based on the duration of time spent pregnant and breastfeeding.</li>



<li><strong>How do environmental toxin exposure and radiation affect breast cancer?<br></strong>Certain factors, such as radiation exposure from previous cancer treatment, working in an environment with toxins, or other radiation exposure can increase your risk of many cancer types, including breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Should I have genetic testing to determine if I have a family-related risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>The short answer is, for some people, yes. However, genetic testing is recommended only after a discussion with your healthcare team or breast specialist about your cancer risks. You may be asked to meet with a genetics counselor to ensure that there is a strong indication for testing.</li>



<li><strong>Does my race affect my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>The answer to this question is complex. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African Americans, American Indians, Pacific Islanders and Alaskan Native Americans have a much higher rate of breast cancer and breast cancer-related mortality. However, there are many nuances to this concerning medical equity, racial disparity and other considerations that need to be explored and addressed.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you have been identified as having a higher risk of breast cancer and referred to a high-risk breast clinic, you can expect a comprehensive meeting with a healthcare professional who is skilled and passionate about breast cancer prevention and survivorship.</p>
