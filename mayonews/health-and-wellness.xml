<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-benefits-of-an-active-workstation/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: Benefits of an active workstation</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic research shows that using an active workstation can help you move more and think better at work — without affecting your job. Sitting too much at work or home can increase your risk of certain diseases. Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez,&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, says using active workstations boosts brain power and can cut down on sitting time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-link-between-heart-disease-and-stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: The link between heart disease and stroke</a></h2>



<p>Every 34 seconds, a person in the U.S. dies from a cardiovascular disease, according to the American Heart Association. Together, heart disease and stroke account for more than 58% of cardiovascular disease deaths. Dr. Stephen English, a Mayo Clinic&nbsp;neurologist, says&nbsp;atrial fibrillation, a type of heart disease causing an abnormal heart rhythm, contributes to nearly 20% of stroke cases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-types-of-brain-tumors-and-treatments/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Types of brain tumors and treatments</a></h2>



<p>A brain tumor can significantly affect a person's quality of life, not just length of life. There are different types of brain tumors and ways to treat them that a healthcare team may consider. Dr. Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa says treatment can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-testing-gait-to-help-in-early-diagnosis-of-neurodegenerative-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: Testing gait to help in early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease</a></h2>



<p>How does your gait — or how you walk — relate to your brain health? Considerably, says Dr. Farwa Ali, a Mayo Clinic neurologist who specializes in movement disorders. The hope is that early diagnosis of gait and balance problems will lead to better treatment and outcomes for patients with degenerative brain disorders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-this-bright-red-birthmark-on-my-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: What is this bright red birthmark on my baby?</a></h2>



<p>A hemangioma, also known as a strawberry birthmark, is a bright red birthmark that appears in the first or second week of life. Although technically tumors, parents shouldn't let that name or their stark appearance worry them. Dr. Megha Tollefson, a Mayo Clinic pediatric dermatologist, explains what caregivers should know if their child has a hemangioma.</p>

<p>It's a long-standing discussion for all who want to get into shape. When is the best time to exercise? According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.future.co/blog/the-most-popular-workout-times-according-to-future-member-data--T8IWv05y4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Future Member</a>, about&nbsp;41%&nbsp;of workouts take place between 7–9 AM or 5–7 PM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The debate is intriguing with proponents of both morning and evening workouts citing various benefits," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/andrew-jagim-phd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Jagim, M.D</a>., director of sports medicine research at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/orthopedic-surgery/sports-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Onalaska</a>. "From increased energy levels to enhanced performance or greater weight-loss benefits, health experts delve into the science behind exercise timing to shed light on the optimal approach for achieving fitness goals."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Morning workouts</h2>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/03/man-waking-up-from-sleep-and-turning-off-alarm-clock-16x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="man waking up from sleep and turning off alarm clock" class="wp-image-85756 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/03/man-waking-up-from-sleep-and-turning-off-alarm-clock-16x9.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/03/man-waking-up-from-sleep-and-turning-off-alarm-clock-16x9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>For morning exercisers, the allure of starting the day with a workout is undeniable.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>"Getting your workout in and completed before you even begin your day can provide a sense of accomplishment and set a positive tone for the day ahead," explains Dr. Jagim. "The post-workout release of endorphins and the satisfaction of accomplishing something before 9 a.m. can serve as a powerful ego boost."</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, morning workouts eliminate the need to worry about finding time for exercise later in the day because&nbsp;it's often the only time of the day that hasn't been previously committed to work, social events or family activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"By completing your workout in the morning, you free up your afternoons and evenings for other activities, such as cooking dinner, socializing or simply relaxing," Dr. Jagim notes. "This sense of freedom and flexibility can alleviate stress and enhance overall well-being."</p>



<p>For people embarking on morning workouts, strategic pre-exercise nutrition can make a significant difference in energy levels and performance.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/01/a-nutritious-healthy-breakfast-with-cereal-fruit-juice-and-an-egg-16x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="a nutritious, healthy breakfast with cereal, fruit, juice and an egg" class="wp-image-110240" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/01/a-nutritious-healthy-breakfast-with-cereal-fruit-juice-and-an-egg-16x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/01/a-nutritious-healthy-breakfast-with-cereal-fruit-juice-and-an-egg-16x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/01/a-nutritious-healthy-breakfast-with-cereal-fruit-juice-and-an-egg-16x9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>"Starting the day with a balanced breakfast containing carbohydrates, protein and healthy fats can provide the necessary energy to power through a morning workout," Dr. Jagim advises. "Opt for whole-grain cereals, Greek yogurt with fruit, and allow sufficient time for digestion to prevent discomfort and optimize nutrient absorption. Or, if you’re not hungry in the mornings or don’t have time, something simple like an energy bar can suffice."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Evening workouts</h2>



<p>However, for some people, waking up early to exercise is the last thing they feel like doing, and, therefore, the case for evening workouts is more appealing.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="724" height="407" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/07/a-middle-aged-Black-woman-outside-smiling-while-exercising-walking-and-carrying-hand-weights-16x9-1.jpg" alt="a middle aged Black woman outside, smiling while exercising, walking and carrying hand weights, workout" class="wp-image-311569" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/07/a-middle-aged-Black-woman-outside-smiling-while-exercising-walking-and-carrying-hand-weights-16x9-1.jpg 724w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/07/a-middle-aged-Black-woman-outside-smiling-while-exercising-walking-and-carrying-hand-weights-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /></figure></div>


<p>"Your body's ability to perform peaks in the afternoon and early evening, with optimal muscle function, strength and endurance," states&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jacob-erickson-do">Jake Erickson, D.O</a>.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/orthopedic-surgery/sports-medicine">sports medicine</a>, Mayo Clinic Health System in Onalaska. "During this time, your body has time to wake up a bit by moving around throughout the day, you've likely gotten a meal or two in to ensure adequate energy available to use during the workout, and you may be more mentally alert."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, oxygen uptake kinetics are more favorable in the evening, allowing for more efficient utilization of resources during exercise. "Your body is primed for performance in the late afternoon and early evening, making it an ideal window for high-intensity activities like interval training or speed work," Dr. Erickson explains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversely, people opting for evening workouts face unique considerations in balancing time commitments and mental energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"After a long day at work or shuttling around the kids all day, it can be hard to muster the motivation to go to the gym and put forth a lot of physical effort during a workout," adds&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/alecia-gende-do">Alecia Gende, D.O.</a>, sports medicine and emergency physician at Mayo Clinic Health System in Onalaska. "Additionally, intense physical activity in the evening may trigger a stress response and cause difficulty falling asleep or waking in the middle of the night if your cortisol is disrupted and released at an inopportune time. If you have to get a workout in before sleep it would be best to be lower intensity such as a walk or lighter lifting session. If that's the case moving the workout earlier in the day might be more beneficial for them."</p>



<p>Lastly, if you choose to work out later in the day, it's important to ensure you are getting adequate nutrients throughout the day to make sure you have enough fuel available to support the workout, in addition to eating a well-balanced meal after the workout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"After a long day, it's essential to refuel the body with carbohydrates and protein," Dr. Jagim suggests. "Consuming a nutrient-rich meal within two hours of your workout can facilitate muscle recovery and enhance adaptation to training. Consider options such as grilled chicken with quinoa and vegetables, or a protein-packed stir-fry to refuel and replenish after an evening workout."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What about a midday workout</h2>



<p>Whether working or at home, most people hit the dreaded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/how-to-wake-yourself-up">afternoon slump</a>&nbsp;around 3 p.m.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36546-5">A study of more than 90,000 people</a>&nbsp;recently found working out in the afternoon reduces the risk of heart disease or early death more than physical activity in either the morning or afternoon.&nbsp;The benefits of afternoon exercise for longevity were most pronounced for men and the elderly.</p>



<p>"Morning workouts may not be ideal for shift workers or those working late or staying up later in the evening," says Dr. Gende. "In that case, it may be more prudent to allow more sleep in the morning and perform a mid-day workout or early afternoon workout before your next evening shift or late night."&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a OnePoll survey, the most effective activity for people for an afternoon workout is getting up and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/fitness-exercise/walking-benefits">going for a walk</a>, which is a great way to perk up both your mind and body.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid just staying on the couch</h2>



<p>For those who just say I don't have any time available, there's always time.</p>



<p>"I suggest scheduling a “snack competing” activity," says Dr. Erickson. "This can be a good excuse to flip the script and for people who know they may choose to sit on the couch and snack in the evenings. They can use that time to grab a workout of some kind instead. This can lead to a big swing in people’s fitness as they consume less calories by avoiding the typical snacking time and burn more calories by the workout."</p>



<p>For people engaging in prolonged or intense exercise sessions (more than 90 minutes), mid-workout nutrition can play a pivotal role in sustaining energy levels and preventing fatigue. Dr. Jagim recommends incorporating carbohydrate-rich snacks during extended workouts to maintain endurance and performance.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding the optimal balance</h2>



<p>So, what is the best time to exercise? There are even benefits to splitting up a workout into short 10-minute mini-sessions throughout the day if you don't have time to get a full 60-minute session in.</p>



<p>One thing is clear; even though science may seem contradictory, the importance of regular physical activity cannot be overstated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Ultimately, the best time to exercise is the time that fits into your schedule and aligns with your energy levels and preferences," concludes Dr. Jagim. "Consistency and adherence to a regular exercise routine are key and far more important regardless of the time of day you choose to work out. Any time of day is better than no exercise in reducing the risk of death from any cause, heart disease, and cancer. Experimentation and self-awareness are essential in determining the ideal timing toward optimizing exercise performance, recovery and overall well-being."&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="660" height="370" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/holding-pizza-slice-outdoors16x9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-388510" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/holding-pizza-slice-outdoors16x9.jpg 660w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/holding-pizza-slice-outdoors16x9-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure></div>


<p>Your <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/tonsils-tiny-but-pack-a-big-punch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tonsils</a> are oval-shaped pads of tissue in the back of your throat, one on each side. They work as part of your body's immune system to filter bacteria and viruses. Tonsils also make white blood cells and antibodies to help fight infections.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are tonsil stones?</h2>



<p>Tonsil stones form from substances like food particles that become lodged in the crevices of your tonsils. People with large tonsils usually have irregularities on the surface, called crypts. When swallowing, food particles, saliva or mucus can get caught in the holes and become calcified and hard.</p>



<p>Tonsil stones become evident when small pebbles appear on the surface of the tonsils. The stones may look white or yellow. If they form deep in the tissue of the tonsils, the stones may not be visible.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Tonsil redness and irritation are common symptoms of tonsil stones. In some instances, they can cause chronic tonsil inflammation or infection of the tonsils, called tonsillitis.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="210" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/tonsils-illustration.jpg" alt="Tonsil reddness are common symptoms of tonsil stones" class="wp-image-366765 size-full" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Tonsil redness and irritation are common symptoms of tonsil stones. In some instances, they can cause chronic tonsil inflammation or infection of the tonsils, called tonsillitis.</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>People with a history of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tonsillitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tonsillitis </a>may be more susceptible. Each time the tonsils are enlarged from infection, small holes tend to develop from the swelling.</p>



<p>People with large tonsils also are more at risk of developing stones. Large tonsils have a large surface area that develops holes on the surface where food particles can collect and turn into tonsil stones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h2>



<p>It's difficult to prevent tonsil stones because they are created by food and other substances passing through the mouth to the stomach. While you can't prevent them, you can minimize the development with good oral hygiene.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/keeping-childrens-teeth-healthy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brush your teeth</a>&nbsp;after meals, in the morning and before bed. While brushing your teeth, also gently brush your tongue, followed by flossing. Regularly use a mouthwash that does not have an alcohol base. Good oral hygiene reduces the bacteria in your mouth that can lead to the formation of tonsil stones.</p>



<p>Tonsil stones are not harmful to your health and are more of a nuisance than an issue. A frequent complaint about tonsil is that they tend to cause <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bad-breath/symptoms-causes/syc-20350922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad breath</a> due to the bacteria that collect on the tonsils.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment</h2>



<p>For people with a history of tonsil stones, removing the tonsils is a permanent way to prevent future bouts. The tonsils are removed in a surgery called tonsillectomy.</p>



<p>If tonsillectomy surgery is not an option due to your medical history, age or personal preference, you can manage tonsil stones in other ways.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team about removing them your own. You can remove them by gently pressing on them with a cotton swab. You may also consider using a low-pressure water irrigator to rinse out the crypts in the tonsils. Gargling with salt water after eating can help remove bacteria from the mouth and throat.</p>



<p>You should <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/8-reasons-to-visit-an-ent-specialist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see an ENT healthcare professional</a> for tonsil stones if your tonsils look red, bleed easily, or experience sore throat or ear pain. </p>

<p>Broadcaster Leslye Gale experienced gradual voice loss&nbsp;but was determined to tough it out on the air. Finally, in February 2024, her vocal folds had grown so weak that she had no voice at all.</p>



<p>Given that her job as an announcer for a radio station in Orlando keeps her on air for five hours each morning, this setback was more than a minor inconvenience — it also had the potential to affect her career.</p>



<p>Her condition worsened to the point that she saw local doctors in Central Florida. While her symptoms were quickly confirmed, she was unable to obtain a diagnosis.</p>



<p>That changed when Leslye came into contact with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rutt-amy-l-d-o/bio-20116146">Dr. Amy Rutt</a>, an ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> who specializes in voice disorders.</p>



<p>"One of my listeners heard about what was going on with me, and called the station and urged me to see Dr. Rutt," she says.</p>



<p>The ENT team was able to get Leslye in for an appointment in just a few days. During her first visit, they identified that she had right <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vocal-cord-paralysis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378873#:~:text=Vocal%20cord%20paralysis%20is%20a,to%20speak%20and%20even%20breathe.">vocal fold paralysis</a>. At the time, she was just as stressed about her health as she was about the work she was missing.</p>



<p>"I had lost endorsements due to my inability to produce voiceovers," Leslye says. "This condition was affecting both my personal life and my professional life."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting answers</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Dr. Rutt and Stacey Menton, speech pathologist, explained Leslye's condition to her in a way she could understand. They also presented her with options.</p>



<p>"Our goal is to help each individual get through their vocal recovery as seamlessly as possible while minimizing the emotional and financial impact on their life,” says Dr. Rutt, noting that even a mild voice disorder can cause big challenges to those who use their voices professionally — such as singers, voice actors, professors and radio hosts.</p>



<p>Following a quick procedure at Mayo Clinic, Leslye was able to get rehabilitative support, including telehealth appointments to conduct speech therapy video visits with Menton.</p>



<p>"We wanted Leslye to have the comfort of being in her own home — or even in her radio studio — and have the ability to sit and conduct face-to-face, personalized therapy," Menton says. "It has been a great approach so that she can have the benefits of in-person care while also experiencing the convenience of video visits when it makes sense."</p>



<p>Before long, Leslye's voice diction, strength and tone were the same as before she experienced vocal fold paralysis.</p>



<p>After recovering her voice, the first thing she did was tell her husband that she loved him. "The Mayo Clinic ENT team absolutely changed the game for me and got my quality of life back," Leslye says, noting a recent trip she and her husband made to see country music star Chris Stapleton perform. "Now I’m back, and I’m able to sing along."</p>

<p>Some babies may develop bright red birthmarks called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hemangiomas-grow-during-childs-first-year-but-can-take-years-to-go-away-on-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hemangiomas</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Tollefson says they're technically tumors, but parents shouldn't let that name or their stark appearance worry them.</p>



<p>"They're actually the most common tumor of infancy, happening anywhere from 1 in 20 to 1 in 50 babies. They are just a collection of blood vessels that grows in the first part of a baby's life," says Dr. Tollefson.</p>



<p>They're more common among babies born preterm. And they can appear anywhere on the body, but commonly involve the head and neck areas.</p>



<p>Another feature that might alarm parents is the rapid rate of growth. Dr. Tollefson says hemangiomas will continue to grow until children are about 6 to 9 months old. At that point, they typically stabilize, then go away slowly.</p>



<p>"About 90% of hemangiomas resolve — or involute is what we call it — by age 4. So it's a pretty slow process," says Dr. Tollefson.</p>



<p>Treatment usually isn't needed. However, Dr. Tollefson says if the hemangioma interferes with vision, other functions, has the potential to be cosmetically disfiguring, is large or is growing rapidly, babies should be evaluated for treatment.</p>



<p>"There are really two main treatments that we use now. The gold standard of treatment for a baby that needs a medicine by mouth is a heart medicine called propranolol."</p>



<p>"That type of medicine is called a beta blocker. There's also a topical form of that medicine, and there are some babies for whom that might be appropriate."</p>



<p>Later in life, laser surgery may be an option to treat residual hemangiomas. But Dr. Tollefson says that is not always needed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;A new variant of COVID-19, known as FLiRT, is now the most dominant strain in the U.S. This variant, which evolved from the omicron strain, is characterized by changes in its spike protein — the part of the virus that binds to host cells. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/binnicker-matthew-j-ph-d/bio-20513862?_ga=2.224776410.1916523742.1658847814-1971724449.1645459629?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Matthew Binnicker</a>,&nbsp;director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview/specialty-groups/clinical-microbiology?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Virology Laboratory</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic, says that these changes could increase the virus' ability to infect cells and evade the immune system, even in people who have previously been infected or vaccinated.</p>



<p>"This variant can evade the immune response more effectively than prior versions of the virus. If you've been infected, or you've been vaccinated, and you've got some antibodies in your system, those antibodies may not recognize the protein on the surface of the virus as well," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this new variant is now&nbsp;<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responsible</a>&nbsp;for more than 28% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Dr. Binnicker says there is a potential for an increase in cases during the summer months, with a more significant surge expected in the fall and winter.</p>



<p>"I anticipate we'll see an uptick in cases with this more transmissible virus that can evade the immune system. But what I'm really watching are the fall and winter months because that's typically when we see the largest surge in <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-expert-discusses-increasing-levels-of-respiratory-infections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">respiratory viral infections</a>," he says.</p>

<p>For those who are vaccinated, antibodies are present to combat the virus. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies can vary with different virus variants.</p>



<p>"With this latest round of variants, this FLiRT variant, the antibodies that you have from past vaccination may not bind and neutralize the virus as well. If you've been infected or vaccinated in the past three to four months, you’re probably going to have antibodies that are going to recognize these newer viruses effectively. And it will help you keep from getting really sick and may even help prevent you from coming down with any symptoms," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>"If you were infected or vaccinated more than six months ago, you may not have as good of protection, and you may come down with a subsequent infection with the typical symptoms of COVID," he adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of FLiRT</h2>



<p>The symptoms of this variant are consistent with other variants and include:</p>



<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Sore throat</li>



<li>Body aches</li>



<li>Cough</li>



<li>Runny nose</li>



<li>Shortness of breath (especially in unvaccinated people or those infected long ago)</li>
</ul>



<p>Receiving an updated vaccine will help protect you from the newer strain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each hurricane season, it is critical to take proactive steps to protect yourself, your family and your property. Hurricanes and other severe storm events can be devastating, but with proper preparation, you can minimize risks and stay safe. This year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service forecasters predict an 85% chance for <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">above-normal hurricane activity</a> in the Atlantic throughout the season beginning June 1 and ending Nov. 30.</p>



<p>Taking time to prepare in advance of severe weather can help reduce stress and ensure personal safety and well-being when a storm does arise. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/beel-brittany-c-m-d/bio-20530273?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Brittany Beel</a>, a Mayo Clinic emergency medicine physician, shares guidelines and essential information about hurricane safety.</p>



<p><strong>Know your risks</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Safe place: Make sure your loved ones have secure locations to take shelter, including the elderly.</li>



<li>Secure your stuff: Trees, patio furniture and outside decorations can easily become flying debris during a hurricane. Secure them or move them inside if possible.</li>



<li>Watch the wires: Unplug any unnecessary electronics. Flooding can happen quickly, and this can lead to electric shocks and potential fire hazards.</li>



<li>Battery power: Stock up on batteries in case the power goes out. Keep in mind that medical devices may also need backup batteries.</li>



<li>Keep cool: When the air conditioning goes out, heat stroke and heat exhaustion can happen. You can obtain battery-powered fans to keep cool if the AC stops working to prevent heat exhaustion and heat stroke.</li>



<li>Just cutting it: Use precaution when trying to cut tree limbs and clear debris. Be wary of using chainsaws if you are not a professional. You do not want to lose your own limb in addition to a tree limb. If you are going to clear debris, wear eye-safety goggles as well. Debris can easily blow into your eyes from residual storm winds.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Preventing illness and injury</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Have your medications ready: If you know a hurricane or tropical storm is on the way, make plans to obtain your daily medications in advance. For example, if you take insulin daily, make sure you have enough available for several days in case pharmacies are closed. </li>



<li>Prepare for others: If you have children or care for elderly relatives, make sure you have several days of their medications readily available. If a grandparent uses oxygen, ensure they have several tanks available.</li>



<li>Water, water, water: Stock up on clean, bottled water. Avoid using tap water, as it is prone to contamination during flooding.</li>



<li>Do not forget the electrolytes: While it is important to stay hydrated with water, you also need drinks with electrolytes to ensure your body is replenished with the tools it needs to keep functioning. Electrolytes help your body use water effectively, so drinking only water is not enough. Stock up on sports drinks.</li>
</ul>
