<p>March is <a href="https://www.kidney.org/content/national-kidney-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Kidney Month</a>, which makes this a good time to learn about kidney cancer.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352664?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Kidney cancer</a> is cancer that begins in the kidneys, which are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fist. They're behind your abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of your spine. The kidneys remove waste from your blood and regulate a healthy balance between water, sodium and minerals in your bloodstream.</p>



<p>Approximately 81,600 new cases of kidney cancer ― more than 52,000 in men and 29,000 in women ― will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year, and 14,390 people ― 9,450 men and 4,940 women ― will die from the disease, according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/kidney-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>.</p>



<p>There may be no signs or symptoms early in the disease. In time, signs and symptoms of kidney cancer can develop, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Blood in your urine, which may appear pink-, red- or cola-colored.</li>



<li>Pain in your back or side that doesn't go away.</li>



<li>Loss of appetite.</li>



<li>Unexplained weight loss.</li>



<li>Tiredness.</li>



<li>Fever.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<p>Factors that can increase the risk of kidney cancer include older age, smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, treatment for kidney failure, certain inherited syndromes and a family history of kidney cancer.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352669?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Treatment</a> for kidney cancer usually begins with surgery to remove the cancer. For cancers confined to the kidney, this may be the only treatment needed. If the cancer has spread beyond the kidney, additional treatments may be recommended.</p>



<p>Small kidney cancers are sometimes destroyed using nonsurgical treatments, such as heat and cold. These procedures may be an option in certain situations, such as in people with other health problems that make surgery risky.</p>



<p>Kidney cancer that comes back after treatment and kidney cancer that spreads to other parts of the body may not be curable. Treatments may help control the cancer and keep you comfortable. In these situations, treatments may include surgery, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and radiation therapy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic risk of breast cancer</a> has been in the news lately. Researchers at the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> are working toward pinpointing individuals’ risk of developing breast cancer.</p>



<p>The discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the 1990s enabled many women to learn they are at high risk of developing breast cancer. More than a dozen other breast cancer genes have been identified since, but the risks associated with them have been far less certain.</p>



<p>Research from Mayo Clinic has filled critical gaps in the understanding of how these genes predispose women to disease.</p>



<p>Breast cancer is typically broken down into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/in-depth/breast-cancer/art-20045654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four major molecular subtypes</a>&nbsp;— triple-negative, HER2-positive, luminal A and luminal B — each with different degrees of aggressiveness and responses to treatment.&nbsp;Through an industry collaboration with a genetic testing company, Mayo Clinic researchers analyzed testing results from nearly 55,000 breast cancer patients and found that&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32091585/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different breast cancer genes</a>&nbsp;appear to drive each of the different subtypes.</p>



<ul>
<li>In 2021, Mayo Clinic researchers and nearly 60 other researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471974/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a seminal study</a>&nbsp;in the New England Journal of Medicine that provided more accurate risk estimates for 28 different breast cancer genes and found that 16 of the 28 genes previously thought to play a role in breast cancer did not increase a woman’s risk of disease.</li>
</ul>



<p>Women newly diagnosed with cancer in one breast often want to know the chances that the disease will spread to the other breast or to other parts of the body.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Using data from the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility (CARRIERS) consortium, Mayo Clinic researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36623243/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">determined the risks</a>&nbsp;that women carrying different germline genetic mutations had of developing cancer in both breasts, known as contralateral breast cancer. For example, they found that carriers of ATM mutations did not have a significantly elevated risk of contralateral breast cancer, whereas those with BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 mutations had double the risk.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Colorectal cancer, the third-most common cancer in the U.S., has been rising among younger people for the past two decades. It is not one type of cancer but two cancers: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colon cancer</a>, which starts in the large intestine, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rectal cancer</a>, which begins in the last part of the large intestine, known as the rectum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Derek Ebner, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/sections/overview/ovc-20348241?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gastroenterologist</a>, notes that colorectal cancer has been increasing in adults under age 50, particularly for rectal cancer.

<p>"Historically, colorectal cancer was equally divided along the colon and rectum, but particularly for those with early onset colorectal cancer — age less than 50<sub>&nbsp;</sub>— we're seeing higher rates of rectal cancer among the younger onset," says Dr. Ebner.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Warning signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Dr. Ebner says four key symptoms have been identified for people under 50 who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, seeing blood with bowel motions, as well as iron deficiency anemia," he says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="804" height="452" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg" alt="Graphic of warning signs of colorectal cancer with Mayo Clnic identifier" class="wp-image-383697" style="width:856px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg 804w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Warning signs of colorectal cancer</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Ebner notes that blood loss after bowel movements, even if not visibly apparent, can lead to low iron levels.</p>



<p>"If on a blood test, for example, we see a sign of iron deficiency, that would then prompt us to explore further," he says.</p>



<p>Even though it may be embarrassing, he stresses, "If you have any of those symptoms, you need to share it with a healthcare provider. That way, they can navigate those subsequent steps."</p>



<p>Which can lead to early treatment and better outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reducing risks of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>While it's not possible to completely prevent cancer, there are ways to reduce your risks and that includes following a healthy lifestyle.</p>



<p>"Abiding by a healthy lifestyle is critical," says Dr. Ebner. "Following a well-rounded diet,  staying physically active, for instance, perhaps can be protective. The other key, though, is just being very mindful of those symptoms, and then also underscoring the importance of screening."</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Screening</strong>: Talk to your healthcare team about colorectal cancer screening.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise</strong>: Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Eat fruits, veggies and whole grains.</li>



<li><strong>Weight</strong>: Maintain a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Don't smoke, limit alcohol consumption.</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple myeloma is a cancer that forms in a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell that builds up in bone marrow.</p>



<p>"Some of these plasma cells develop mutations over time and become abnormal and produce an abnormal protein. We call it an immunoglobulin, or in our world, we call it a monoclonal protein. And so that can cause damage over time," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>The damage caused by multiple myeloma can lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351360?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anemia</a>, bone pain, frequent infections and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20369048?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney failure</a>.</p>



<p>"The treatment involves … we call it plasma cell directed therapy," says Dr. Cook. "It's treatments that are specifically directed at the immune system. So it's usually a combination of three or four drugs."</p>



<p>Other advances in treatment include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow transplant</a>, in which a person's own stem cells are infused after high-dose chemotherapy to rebuild and regenerate healthy bone marrow.</p>



<p>"We've seen new therapies like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20404319?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T</a>, or chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy, where we're taking people's T cells, we're engineering them to specifically recognize a myeloma cell," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>Because of advances like these, the prognosis for patients with multiple myeloma continues to improve.</p>



<p>"Several years ago, people would say that the survival was three to five years. And I would say now, median or average survival is about 10 years or even longer," says Dr. Cook. "Hopefully, we can extend the expected survival beyond 20 years and maybe eventually find a cure in my lifetime, I hope."</p>

<p>Multiple myeloma is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell in the bone marrow. When multiple myeloma develops in the bone marrow, cancerous plasma cells multiply, crowding out healthy cells.</p>



<p>"Over time, people develop abnormalities or mutations in their plasma cells. Those mutations cause plasma cells to become cancerous," says Joselle Cook, M.B.B.S., a Mayo Clinic hematologist specializing in multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders. "Older age is a risk factor. Multiple myeloma is commonly diagnosed in people in their 60s and 70s. We also know that Black people develop myeloma about 10 years earlier than white people, and two to three times more frequently."</p>



<p>Having a family history of multiple myeloma may also increase the risk of the disease.</p>



<p>An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/multiple-myeloma/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated 35,780 new cases</a>&nbsp;of multiple myeloma will be diagnosed in the United States in 2024. While multiple myeloma is a serious condition, people with the disease are living longer because treatments have advanced. "The prognosis has changed remarkably over the last few years," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>Read on for an overview of how multiple myeloma evolves, how healthcare professionals treat it, and the quest to find a screening test to diagnose the disease before it can damage the body.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The evolution of multiple myeloma</h2>



<p>Cancerous plasma cells — myeloma cells — make proteins that cause the symptoms and complications of multiple myeloma. "When the plasma cells develop mutations and produce a monoclonal protein, this group of conditions is called monoclonal gammopathies," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>The earliest phase of monoclonal gammopathies is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mgus/symptoms-causes/syc-20352362?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)</a>, which doesn't cause symptoms. When a person has MGUS, monoclonal protein, or M-protein, is found in their blood at a level too low to damage the body. "If we detect M-protein in a person's blood, and we aren't concerned about organ damage, we monitor them," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>If cancerous plasma cells continue to multiply and produce M-proteins, MGUS evolves into smoldering multiple myeloma. People still don't have symptoms at this phase but have a higher M-protein level in their blood and urine.</p>



<p>People with smoldering multiple myeloma are classified based on their risk of progressing to multiple myeloma: low risk, intermediate risk or high risk. "We may treat some people with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma, typically as part of a clinical trial, but for the most part, we actively monitor people without treating them," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>Multiple myeloma might be suspected when blood tests conducted for another reason raise red flags. "We may see that the protein is quite elevated or that a patient has a lower blood count than usual or an abnormality in their kidney numbers," she says. This prompts a care team to order blood tests to detect M-protein and assess blood chemistry and kidney function, urine tests to detect proteins, imaging tests to identify bone problems, and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-biopsy/about/pac-20393117?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow biopsy</a>&nbsp;to look for myeloma cells.</p>



<p>People with multiple myeloma can experience a variety of symptoms or none. This can make diagnosing the disease a challenge. When a healthcare professional suspects multiple myeloma, they frequently check for specific signs and symptoms. "People with multiple myeloma may have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351360?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anemia</a>. If the M-proteins deposit in the kidneys and cause them to fail, they will have kidney abnormalities. They may have bone pain and high blood calcium levels caused by bone destruction," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Multiple myeloma treatment options</h2>



<p>Treatment for multiple myeloma typically starts with a combination of medications called induction chemotherapy. "Treatment involves plasma-cell directed therapy," says Dr. Cook. "It's usually a combination of three or four drugs: A steroid, an immunomodulating agent (a drug that stimulates the immune system to fight cancer), an antibody (<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/anti-cd38-monoclonal-antibody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-CD38</a>) that targets a surface marker on the cancerous plasma cell, and a proteasome inhibitor that targets the cell's protein manufacturing."</p>



<p>Your care team will also decide if you are a candidate for a bone marrow transplant. "This decision depends on factors like fitness and age — it's a soft cut-off, but generally, we don't transplant patients over 75. There are exceptions, though," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>The drugs your care team uses in your induction chemotherapy will depend on your overall health and whether you are a candidate for a bone marrow transplant.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow transplant</a>&nbsp;— a stem cell transplant — is a procedure that infuses healthy blood-forming stem cells into your body to regenerate the bone marrow's ability to produce blood cells. Stem cell transplants can pose risks, and some people can have serious complications.</p>



<p>If eligible, people with multiple myeloma typically have a stem cell transplant after about four to six months of induction chemotherapy. Before the transplant, they receive a high dose of a different type of chemotherapy called conditioning chemotherapy.</p>



<p>Dr. Cook uses a garden metaphor to explain how conditioning and stem cell transplants work to treat multiple myeloma. "In myeloma, your bone marrow is akin to a garden overgrown with weeds (the myeloma). You use strong weed killers (the conditioning chemotherapy) to eliminate those weeds, but then the garden is barren. You need to plant seeds to allow the garden to grow. That's what a stem cell transplant does. The reinfusion of stem cells is like planting seeds so your bone marrow can recover faster."</p>



<p>Dr. Cook says other promising treatment options exist if you cannot undergo a bone marrow transplant. "For people who relapse after several types of treatment,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20404319?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a>, where people's T cells are engineered to recognize and kill a myeloma cell, offers great response rates and good survival. And we've seen success with new drugs called&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-researchers-study-new-class-of-drugs-to-treat-multiple-myeloma/">bispecific antibodies</a>&nbsp;— specially designed antibodies that redirect a patient's T cells (immune cells) to kill myeloma cells," she says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162#:~:text=Radiation%20therapy%2C%20also%20called%20radiotherapy,methods%20of%20radiation%20are%20precise.?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radiation therapy</a>&nbsp;may also be an option to treat areas of the body affected by myeloma that are painful or causing other problems, says Dr. Cook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research aimed at catching multiple myeloma early</h2>



<p>"Being diagnosed early is important because you want to avoid organ damage, renal impairment and bone destruction. If we can detect and diagnose multiple myeloma early, we can prevent that damage," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>"MGUS and multiple myeloma are detected most often. It's less common to detect smoldering multiple myeloma," says Dr. Cook. She says researchers are exploring screening options — primarily blood tests — to identify MGUS and smoldering myeloma.</p>



<p>Dr. Cook is working with colleagues on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20562448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial</a>&nbsp;in Rochester, Minnesota, to screen people of East African descent. Other&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/05/23/is-a-cancer-clinical-trial-right-for-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trials</a>&nbsp;are studying people with MGUS and those in higher-risk populations. "There are screening studies focused on Black people and those who have first-degree relatives with myeloma or MGUS," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Cook is confident that the outlook for people diagnosed with multiple myeloma will continue to improve. "There are so many treatment options being developed," she says. "The field is just forging ahead."</p>

<p>March 8 is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/womens-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Women's Day</a>, and it's also Women's History Month, providing an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of women in science and research.</p>



<p>Women have played a significant role in shaping Mayo Clinic's history and its future. In this Q&amp;A, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/radisky-evette-s-ph-d/bio-00094471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Evette Radisky,</a> a researcher and educator at Mayo Clinic, shares her perspective on the challenges some women face in scientific careers.</p>



<p>Dr. Radisky is a consultant in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-cancer-biology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Cancer Biology</a> and the associate dean of the <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in Florida</a>, where she is also a professor of cancer biology and pharmacology. She leads the<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/proteases-cancer/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Proteases in Cancer Laboratory</a> at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you share experiences or observations about the challenges women in science face in advancing their careers in biomedical research?</strong></p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Despite achieving gender parity at the graduate school and postdoctoral levels, we still see a leaky pipeline with lower representation of women as we look up the ladder of faculty ranks and leadership roles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journey toward career advancement involves balancing career aspirations with personal responsibilities, which for women often include family caregiving. The pivotal years of transition to research independence are demanding, marked by the need to obtain a highly competitive faculty position, establish oneself as an authority in a scientific niche, produce high-quality publications, win grants and promote one's research. For many women, these years coincide with starting or expanding a family, or taking on other caregiving roles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tug of war between these competing demands can feel overwhelming. Reflecting on my own path, I remember many moments of doubt, like one late night alone in a hotel room awaiting my first faculty job interview the next morning, separated for the first time from my infant daughter and very much questioning my career choice. Despite not securing that position, I remained determined, and after much practice and numerous interviews, I landed an amazing position at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later, as an assistant professor and new mother to my second child, I found myself in a stressed funding period for my lab and felt compelled to dedicate my six-week maternity leave to an NIH R01 grant application. The isolation I felt as I researched and wrote in my home office, depending heavily on others to care for my newborn, again made me doubt my path. Although that application was not successful, it laid critical groundwork for subsequent grant applications and eventually led to my securing the necessary support for the project, my laboratory and my research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Women routinely face these decisions and sacrifices as they seek career advancement in biomedical research. At some point along the path, many very talented women reflect on the cost of "success" and choose to reconsider their career trajectories in favor of a more satisfying balance. Each woman in biomedical research must forge a path that honors both her professional aspirations and her personal values, striving toward a career where success is measured by fulfillment and balance.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: What barriers in the scientific community disproportionately affect women, and how can they hinder career progression?</strong></p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Certain systemic attitudes and practices in science serve as barriers to the career progression of women. One is the absence of flexible mechanisms to pause and restart one's career trajectory, enabling time away from work to temporarily focus on personal or family responsibilities. This lack of flexibility often leaves women apprehensive that taking a leave could lead them to be judged as not serious or as insufficiently dedicated to their professional pursuits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another significant barrier is the entrenched expectation for scientists to relocate geographically and change institutions as a means of career enhancement. This expectation disproportionately impacts women, who may be reluctant to uproot their families in search of career opportunities. We see this in the pools of applicants for midcareer and established scientist positions; it is much less common for women to pursue moves that could lead to greater resources and leadership opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These systemic challenges emphasize the need for a shift toward more inclusive and flexible career pathways in the scientific community, acknowledging and accommodating the diverse life circumstances of its members.</p>



<p><strong>QUESTION: What strategies effectively promote women's career success in biomedical research, and how can gender equality in the field be further improved?</strong></p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;First, the visible presence of women as faculty and leaders has proven to be profoundly inspirational for those earlier in the career path, giving hope that achieving a successful career is not only possible, but a realistic and attainable goal, worth the effort and sacrifice. I remember how impactful it was for me when the first few female faculty were hired in the chemistry department at my training institution. Their presence and upward trajectory reinforced my aspirations and commitment to my career path.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, to further promote gender equality and support the career development of women in biomedical research, it is crucial to implement strategies that enhance career flexibility. The creation of off-ramps (structured opportunities to pause one's career) paired with on-ramps (pathways for reentry with support and mentoring) can give women greater flexibility in the tempo of their careers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, expanding opportunities for career advancement within Mayo Clinic for our most promising internal candidates is essential. These pathways are particularly important for nurturing talented women who demonstrate great potential in research but are reluctant to relocate in search of career progression.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>QUESTION: What words of advice do you have for women who are pursuing scientific careers?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;The challenges are real, and it is undeniable that the journey will present days when all the choices seem less than ideal. But patience, persistence and consistent effort will be worth it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biomedical research is an extraordinary career with unparalleled levels of intellectual freedom, personal empowerment and the flexibility to explore your own ideas and design your own professional trajectory. It is a privilege to contribute to scientific knowledge, and well worth the dedication and hard work involved.</p>

<p>Colon and rectal cancers may be detected during the same&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-importance-of-a-colonoscopy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screening</a>, but they are treated differently, says Dr. Eric Dozois.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our approach to rectal cancer, for example, often involves more aggressive treatments that help prevent it from coming back," says Dr. Dozois.</p>



<p>Innovation plays a strong role in rectal cancer surgery at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>.</p>



<p>Robotic surgery allows your surgeon to work more efficiently in small spaces, providing an enhanced view of the area where the operation is taking place. Some of the benefits include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Surgery performed while the surgeon sits at a console and uses controls to guide high-tech surgical tools.</li>



<li>Allows surgeons to work in small spaces with three-dimensional visualization, and with more precision, flexibility and control than with conventional techniques.</li>



<li>Minimally invasive, fewer complications, quicker recovery, fewer urological complications and may reduce nerve dysfunction.</li>
</ul>



<p>"We're using laparoscopic and robotic platforms to really offer patients surgery that is most up to date in terms of minimally invasive techniques, the least amount of trauma to the patient, but yet achieving the goals of surgery to remove the cancer," he says.</p>



<p>If colon cancer is caught early, surgery may be the only treatment that is necessary, but Dr. Dozois says, "Even in some of the earlier stages, a more aggressive approach that combines chemotherapy, radiation and surgery is necessary to keep it not only from coming back locally, but from spreading to other parts of the body."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/price-katharine-a-m-d/bio-20054955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Katharine Price</a>, a medical oncologist with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>, says that while <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hpv-infection-may-cause-throat-mouth-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV-related throat cancer</a> is often curable, prevention is best.</p>

<p>Oropharyngeal&nbsp;cancers are the most common HPV-related cancers, and they occur more frequently in men. About 60% to 70% of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/symptoms-causes/syc-20354171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head and neck cancers </a>are linked to the virus.  Dr. Price explains where it often develops.</p>



<p>"Largely in the oropharynx — this part of the throat that is at the tonsil and then circling around to the back of the tongue, and it's where all of this lymphoid-rich tissue lives," she says.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing throat cancer</h3>



<p>These cancers are treatable, but prevention is always better, starting with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/in-depth/hpv-vaccine/art-20047292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV vaccine</a>.</p>



<p>"It's a vaccine that is recommended for all boys and girls, at age 11 and 12. That's when it's on the routine recommendation list for vaccines, although you can actually give it as early as 9," Dr. Price says.</p>



<p>The vaccine is available to people through age 45.<br><br>"It's much better to get a vaccine that's safe, that has no long-term side effects or complications than to have to go through surgery, radiation, chemotherapy," says Dr. Price.</p>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/schedules-recommendations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more</a>&nbsp;information on the vaccine dosage and schedule for children and adults.</p>



<p>Along with vaccination, you can reduce risks by avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol use.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">HPV infection is often symptomless and can lead to cancers of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20352509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervix</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vagina</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vulvar-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20368051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vulva</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/mens-health/in-depth/penis-health/art-20046175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">penis</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anus</a> as well as the throat.</h3>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fighting cancer with the spirit of a warrior and a smile</strong></h2>



<p>No matter what life throws at her, Evelyn's parents say she just keeps on smiling. "That's how she looks 99% of the time even if she doesn't feel good," says her mom, Claire Owens. Evelyn's dad agrees. "She's very, very tough," says Austin Owens.</p>



<p>Evelyn's toughness was put to the test when pathology results revealed she had cancer. </p>



<p>"Everybody thought it was a cyst," recalls Claire. "Even after surgery they said it was a cyst, and then the pathology came back as cancer."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="536" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912-536x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-382619" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912-536x1024.jpg 536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912-157x300.jpg 157w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912-768x1466.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912-805x1536.jpg 805w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/IMG_7912.jpg 967w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Evelyn was six-years-old when she was diagnosed with cancer         Photo courtesy: Owens family</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is rhabdomyosarcoma?</strong></h2>



<p>Additional tests showed the cancer was <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rhabdomyosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20390962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rhabdomyosarcoma</a>. </strong>RMS begins as a growth of cells in soft tissue, like muscle. It can start anywhere in the body. RMS most often occurs in children younger than the age of ten. Symptoms depend on where the cancer starts and can include lumps under the skin, redness, swelling, and pain. </p>



<p>As part of her treatment, Evelyn's doctors recommended radiation with innovative cancer-fighting technology called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488"><strong>proton </strong></a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>beam</strong></a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488"><strong> therapy</strong></a>. Her family traveled from their home in Oregon to <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491">Mayo Clinic</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491">in Arizona</a> </strong>so Evelyn could receive the cutting-edge therapy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fighting cancer with proton beam therapy</strong></h2>



<p>"Proton therapy allows us to treat the area we need to treat completely while protecting many of the normal tissues nearby," says radiation oncologist, <strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ahmed-safia-k-m-d/bio-20433784">Dr. Safia Ahmed.</a></strong> "And for pediatric patients that's very important because all of their tissues are growing."</p>

"And by minimizing radiation dose and radiation dose side effects to these tissues as they are growing is key. It improves their (patients) quality of life," says Dr. Ahmed.</p>



<p>Evelyn underwent 24 treatments of proton beam therapy over six weeks. Her parents say through it all, she stayed tough and positive. </p>



<p>"I can't imagine going through this with anybody else but you," says Austin about his daughter. "You should be the poster child for going through cancer and cancer treatments. I'm so proud of you and love you so much," he adds.</p>

<p>Evelyn is now 7 years old and back home in Oregon with her family. She will still require some <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-5-advances-in-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>chemotherapy treatment</strong></a>. Doctors say her prognosis looks good. Evelyn will undergo regular monitoring to make sure the cancer does not come back.</p>



<p>These days Evelyn is back to enjoying the things she loves most, like riding ponies with her brother, Henry, and taking her dog, Duke, on walks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>"Evelyn, you are going to do big things"</strong></p><cite>Claire Owens, Evelyn's mom</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>What do tobacco, alcohol and obesity have in common? They can all increase your risk of developing cancer. Smoked tobacco is strongly linked to cancer in almost every part of the body.</p>



<p>"Smoked tobacco produces about 7,000 chemicals, and when you inhale those chemicals in your body, they cause alterations in cells. And it's those alterations in cells that can lead to cancer," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>He says smoking also weakens your immune system, making it harder to fight cancer cells. One of the best ways to lower your cancer risk is to not use any kind of tobacco.</p>



<p>"We always say it's never too late to stop smoking. And the risk for cancer after quitting cigarette smoking, for example, goes down. But it takes some time," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Consuming alcohol increases your risk of breast, head and neck, esophageal, and colorectal cancers.</p>



<p>"At every level of alcohol consumption, there is cancer risk, but heavier drinkers have higher cancer risk than lighter drinkers," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Finally, packing on extra pounds can increase your risk of cancer in several ways.</p>



<p>"Excess body weight increases estrogen and insulin, which can increase the rate of cellular division, which can increase the risk for cancer. But also, excess body weight is associated with inflammation, and inflammation is a known risk factor for the development of cancer," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>



<p>Bariatric surgery has been shown to decrease risk of hormone-related cancers such as breast, endometrial and prostate, as well as pancreatic and colorectal cancers. However, there are less drastic steps people can take.</p>



<p>"Small sustainable steps toward weight loss are the most effective when we think about diet and exercise. Those are the classic approaches, but also there are new medications on the market that can help people lose weight," says Dr. Ebbert.</p>
