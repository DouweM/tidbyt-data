<p>Some say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Is it really? That's up for debate. However, skipping the first meal is not the healthiest choice and can even put someone at risk for health issues. In this Mayo Clinic Minute, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-20053705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, explains why.</p>

<p>"Skipping breakfast, historically, hasn't been something necessarily healthy," Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says.</p>



<p>He adds that missing the first meal of the day isn't good for your heart.</p>



<p>"There are numerous studies showing that people who skip breakfast have an increased risk for heart disease and many other ailments," he says.</p>



<p>Not only that, there's also some evidence to suggest that heart attacks are more likely to happen in the morning.</p>



<p>"Part of it is the high adrenaline state that occurs early in the morning. If you match that with no food, no calories at all, what happens is that the body says, 'Well, with no food, I could die from starvation, so I have to do some extra things.' And those extra things are basically crunching the glands that make adrenaline. And essentially, the body gets into this rush of adrenaline," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>And for those wanting to lose weight through fasting, breakfast is not the right meal to miss.</p>



<p>"People who skip breakfast, many times they're able to do that because they have a pretty large dinner," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez. "So you're feeding the body with calories at the time when your body is just about to go to sleep, when you need calories the least."</p>

<p>Johnathan Sederquist isn’t interested in taking it easy. The active 29-year-old likes to work out early in the morning, do landscaping and excavation work for his company during the day, and tackle home improvement projects — like building a new house on the banks of the Hiwassee River — in his free time. He also loves spending time on the river, water surfing behind his boat or riding one of his two Jet Skis, with his friends and family.</p>



<p>When nerve pain started disrupting Johnathan’s on-the-go personality, he didn’t know what to do about it.</p>



<p>Johnathan first noticed tingling and numbness in his hands about seven years ago, while painting his daughter's nursery before she was born.</p>



<p>"My hand would go numb, and I'd drop the paintbrush," Johnathan says.</p>



<p>While driving, Johnathan also noticed cramping and a burning sensation in his hands. And he frequently lost circulation in his arms. "They'd go limp while I was trying to sleep," he says.</p>



<p>Still, Johnathan largely ignored the symptoms, attributing them to arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>



<p>Eventually, Johnathan saw a doctor near his home in Calhoun, Tennessee, who found a cyst near his spine.</p>



<p>"The doctor told me the cyst was causing my symptoms, and that after I had surgery to remove the cyst, I'd feel like a new man," he recalls.</p>



<p>That’s not what happened though. Johnathan still experienced pain even after the surgery. So much so, that, one night a short time later, he decided he couldn't live with it anymore. "I told Mackenzie, my wife, that I had to find a new doctor," he says. "I had to get help."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A second opinion</strong></h2>



<p>Johnathan's friend knew someone who worked for Mayo Clinic. Johnathan reached out to the contact, who suggested Johnathan schedule an appointment at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, which was the closest Mayo campus to his home. When it was time to travel to Florida, Johnathan didn't hesitate.</p>



<p>"They ran tests and figured out it was thoracic outlet syndrome," he says. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thoracic outlet syndrome</a>, or TOS, is a rare disorder that involves compression of the nerves, arteries or veins in the lower neck and upper chest.</p>



<p>It turned out he had bilateral TOS — meaning it occurred on both his left and right side.</p>



<p>Diagnosing TOS is key to treating it successfully, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/farres-sam-m-d/bio-20055440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sam Farres</a>, chief of the Vascular Surgery Division at Mayo Clinic in Florida. But diagnosing TOS is about much more than just running one test. It's about eliminating other possible causes first.</p>



<p>"TOS is complicated because it's a spectrum of symptoms that are, often, very generic," Dr. Farres says. "And TOS is very rare. That's why we have a protocol we follow, to minimize bias and subjectivity, before we diagnose someone with the syndrome."</p>



<p>With Johnathan, Dr. Farres first tried conservative treatments, like physical therapy. When those didn't effectively reduce the pain though, Dr. Farres recommended a TOS procedure called rib resection surgery. Since TOS affected both sides of his body, he required two surgeries, which were spaced apart to allow time for healing.</p>



<p>"Dr. Farres and everyone on his team were great," Johnathan says. "They were willing to keep going and keep checking everything."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Free from TOS</strong></h2>



<p>Johnathan had the surgeries a month apart. After the first one, he recalls waking up from the procedure in less pain than he had going into it. "I kept telling the doctor and my wife that it felt like I could move my neck easier," he says. "I felt like I could almost turn my head around like an elk. One side of my body felt completely different from the other side."</p>



<p>Just 10 days after his first surgery, in fact, Johnathan started running again. "It didn’t hurt," he says.</p>



<p>In between his surgeries and follow-up appointments, Johnathan kept in touch with his care team on Mayo Clinic's patient portal, always receiving quick responses to his questions.</p>



<p>"Dr. Farres would call and check on me," he says. "They did a great job of keeping up with how I was doing. Now, I’ll never go anywhere else but Mayo Clinic."</p>



<p>Today, Johnathan is still running and back in the gym. And he’s spending more time on the river with Mackenzie and their daughter, Kendall, who's now 6 years old.</p>



<p>"The pain and burning in my hands are gone," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Farres says Johnathan and other patients like him describe the before-and-after difference as a "huge burden" being lifted from their shoulders. "You can tell that, for Johnathan, work is his life, so it hit him hard not being able to lift or remodel or do the things he wanted to do," Dr. Farres says. "Now, I think Johnathan feels free to live his life to its fullest potential. He's telling me all the things he's doing. It's very exciting."</p>

<p>This study is the first to show that a history of preeclampsia is associated with increased concentrations of certain <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/science/biomarkers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biomarkers</a> in the body that are recognized as signs of cellular senescence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Markers of aging</strong></h2>



<p>Cellular senescence is a process in which cells stop dividing but do not die. Instead, the cells remain in the body, releasing inflammatory molecules. Senescence is considered a classic sign of aging.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Suvakov_Sonja_MD_PhD_21149704_201808060236.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-390015" style="width:250px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Suvakov_Sonja_MD_PhD_21149704_201808060236.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/Suvakov_Sonja_MD_PhD_21149704_201808060236-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sonja Suvakov, M.D., Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We suspect senescence may be the pathway leading women to develop preeclampsia, and the process doesn't stop at the delivery of a child," says Sonja Suvakov, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic women's health and nephrology researcher and the first author of the paper. "It continues on, casting a shadow down through the years and making women more likely to develop other diseases associated with aging."</p>



<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32381164/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Previous studies</a> have shown that women with a history of preeclampsia are at greater long-term heart and kidney disease risk and are more likely to develop multiple chronic conditions. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7986688/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This accumulation of chronic conditions</a> is associated with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34391091/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cellular senescence and aging. </a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with the data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, the researchers compared 40 women with a history of preeclampsia to a control group of 40 women who had normal blood pressure during their pregnancies and followed them for six years.&nbsp; They found evidence of increased cellular senescence in women with a history of preeclampsia based on an analysis of three biomarkers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Urinary <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/senolytic-drugs-boost-key-protective-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a-Klotho</a>: This protein is associated with longevity and protects against <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/healthy-aging/longevity-starts-with-better-understanding-the-complexities-of-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oxidative stress</a>, a source of DNA damage, and aging-related diseases. Lower levels of this protein appeared in the preeclampsia group.</li>



<li>Leptin/adiponectin ratio: Higher ratios of these fat hormones, which appeared in the preeclampsia group, are linked to metabolic disorders and accelerated aging. These hormones help regulate appetite and maintain energy balance in the body. </li>



<li><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/what-in-the-world-is-an-extracellular-vesicle-more-from-mayo-clinic-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Extracellular vesicles</a> positive for tissue factor: Higher levels of these particles, which can lead to blood clots and cardiovascular disease risk, appeared in the preeclampsia group. Extracellular vesicles are tiny particles involved in blood clotting; tissue factor is a biomarker associated with inflammation. </li>
</ul>



<p>In the study, women with a history of preeclampsia were four times more likely to experience a major cardiovascular event, such as a stroke. In addition, they were more likely to have multiple chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, chronic kidney disease and depression.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Targets for future treatments</strong></h2>



<p>There are no therapies available to treat cellular senescence in women with preeclampsia. However, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01923-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research is underway</a> to develop treatments designed to specifically target senescent cells associated with diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and a variety of other conditions. The researchers hope the discovery of these new biomarkers will not only improve understanding of how preeclampsia works but will also spur the development of targeted therapies.</p>



<p>"Our future research will explore whether targeting the fundamental aging process will improve immediate and long-term patient outcomes," says Dr. Garovic. "We aim to fill the void for specific therapies."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/about/high-blood-pressure-during-pregnancy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Preeclampsia occurs in 1 in 25 pregnancies.</a> "Banishing the specter of preeclampsia would improve the lives of countless women and their families and transform society in ways we can't even imagine," says Dr. Garovic.</p>

<p>In recent years, there's been a big boost in the beverage industry when it comes to the sale of energy drinks. Classified as dietary supplements, most of these drinks contain stimulating ingredients, in addition to high amounts of caffeine, that aren't regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

<p>They are stocked in coolers around the country. Energy drinks are beverages designed to give you a boost. But can they hurt your heart?</p>



<p>"The healthy heart can handle these chemicals just fine — of course, in moderation. The fragile heart may not be able to," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ackerman-michael-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20053036?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Michael Ackerman</a>, a genetic cardiologist at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Dr. Ackerman led a study looking into the effects of energy drinks on the heart. He warns that while energy drinks may not directly cause cardiac arrest, consuming them, especially in large quantities, can be a "perfect storm" for people with genetic heart conditions.</p>



<p>"Maybe you've been sleep deprived, and now you're taking the energy drink. Then maybe that is going to be the 1-2-3 punch that puts that heart — where normally those chemicals wouldn't have annoyed it — to now where it finally trips up the heart into that potentially life-threatening <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrhythmia</a>," he says.</p>



<p>He says it's not a strong link but a call to be aware.</p>



<p>"It's a call to being alert and aware, and informing your health care provider if you are consuming these drinks," says Dr. Ackerman.</p>

<p>Researchers from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota have published <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/c2dream-framework-investigating-the-structural-mechanisms-undergirding-racial-health-inequities/76ADDAD3F3EEFCBA9E56123E56CB026A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paper</a> in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Science, which provides a new framework describing how racism affects heart health among people of color in Minnesota. The researchers are focused on reversing these disparities.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Sean_Phelan.jpg" alt="Headshot of Dr. Phelan" class="wp-image-389671" style="width:250px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Sean_Phelan.jpg 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Sean_Phelan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Sean_Phelan-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sean Phelan, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This framework will help scientists explore and measure how chronic exposure to racism, not race, influences health outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/phelan-sean-ph-d/bio-20035285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Phelan, Ph.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic health services researcher and senior author of the paper.&nbsp; "This will help enable researchers to design interventions that address the root causes of these disparities and improve heart health for people of color everywhere."</p>



<p>The researchers are part of the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-research-center-to-address-effects-of-racism-on-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Chronic Disease Reduction and Equity Promotion Across Minnesota (C2DREAM)</a>. This research center aims to reduce cardiovascular health disparities in collaboration with Minnesota community leaders and community health organizations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking a broader view to reduce inequities</strong></h2>



<p>Historically, research on racism and health has focused on interpersonal racism. The C2DREAM framework takes a broader view, examining how oppressive systems of power, structural and institutional racism, and interpersonal racism work together to influence the social determinants of health and health outcomes. Social determinants of health are nonmedical factors that affect health; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes them as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/priorities/why-is-addressing-sdoh-important.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/about/sdoh/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age."</a></p>

<p>"Our social structures and policies deny or grant access to opportunities throughout a person's life in ways that can affect health," says <a href="https://carhe.umn.edu/team/kene-orakwue-mph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kene Orakwue</a>, first author of the paper and a predoctoral student in Health Services Research, Policy &amp; Administration at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. "I believe these social structures must be intentionally interrogated in order to reduce inequities."</p>



<p>People who experience chronic racism may be affected by factors such as intergenerational trauma, reduced access to healthcare, differential treatment in healthcare settings and psychological distress. All these things negatively affect heart health and can have a cumulative effect over the course of a person's life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shaping research to disrupt racism</strong></h2>



<p>C2DREAM's goal is to find ways to disrupt racism's effect on heart health. The C2DREAM framework provides a roadmap for researchers, including a shared set of measures for different types of racism.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Felicity_Enders.jpg" alt="Image of Felicity Enders, Ph.D. " class="wp-image-389673" style="width:250px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Felicity_Enders.jpg 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Felicity_Enders-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Felicity_Enders-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Felicity Enders, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"In order to change something, we have to be able to measure it," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/enders-felicity-t-ph-d/bio-00093556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Felicity Enders, Ph.D.</a>, associate director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/resources/funding-opportunities/benefactor-funded-research-mid-career-development-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Science</a> and a C2DREAM co-investigator.</p>



<p>The C2DREAM framework guides critical thinking, exposing the multidimensional relationship between racism and heart health and showing researchers how to measure racism's effects on many levels. In doing so, the framework also shows researchers how to measure the real impact of interventions.</p>



<p>For example, says Dr. Enders, a study involving immigrant communities might look at structural barriers to heart health, such as access to culturally appropriate healthy food; institutional barriers, such as access to language interpreters during telehealth appointments; and interpersonal barriers, such as cultural understanding between doctor and patient.</p>



<p>C2DREAM researchers are already using the framework to guide their work. All C2DREAM-funded studies collect common measures of inequity, such as data on housing segregation and income disparities. This makes it easier to compare, share and combine data across studies. It also leads to a more comprehensive understanding of how racism affects heart health — and how to disrupt those effects — across the state of Minnesota.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Refining measures of racism</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The researchers see the C2DREAM framework as only a starting point. Future research will focus on refining measures of structural, institutional and interpersonal racism and expanding the framework to include the effects of cultural and internalized racism.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learn more about C2DREAM</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>C2DREAM is a regional effort spanning Minnesota that includes Mayo Clinic and Mayo Clinic Health System, the University of Minnesota, Hennepin Healthcare, Native American Community Clinic and the Rand Corp. It brings together researchers and community stakeholders from various disciplines, drawing on evidence-based medical expertise and local and cultural knowledge. C2DREAM is funded by a P50 grant from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. <a href="https://www.mnc2dream.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visit the C2DREAM website to learn more about its ongoing research projects and events</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scientific statement</a> from the American Heart Association published in Circulation provides clinicians with guidance regarding the use of CYP2C19 genetic testing when prescribing oral P2Y12 inhibitor therapy. These drugs help prevent the formation of blood clots, which can cause heart attacks and strokes.</p>



<p>The traditional approach is to prescribe clopidogrel, the most commonly prescribed antiplatelet therapy, regardless of a person's genetic makeup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, certain genetic variations in the CYP2C19 gene can affect how well some people metabolize clopidogrel. These variations make the drug less effective and put those people at a higher risk of a stroke or heart attack.</p>



<p>Studies suggest that using CYP2C19 genetic-guided testing to identify poor metabolizers of clopidogrel and prescribing alternative medications can lead to fewer bleeding events as compared to all patients receiving the newer and more potent drugs.</p>

<p>"CYP2C19 genetic-guided testing tailors the choice of blood thinners based on a patient’s genetic variants," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pereira-naveen-l-m-d/bio-20178506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and chair of the group that issued the statement. "The overarching goal is to prescribe the right drug to the right patient to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity. It is also a cost-effective approach."</p>



<p>Clopidogrel-CYP2C19 is a cardiovascular drug-gene pair with the most comprehensive analysis and clinical trial data. Because of this, clopidogrel has a boxed warning on its drug label stating that CYP2C19 poor metabolizers are at a higher risk for blood clotting events when treated with clopidogrel. The label notes that CYP2C19 genetic testing can identify people with these genetic variations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key points from a Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Clopidogrel is inactive when taken into the body. Activation occurs after the CYP2C19 enzyme has metabolized it. There is genetic variation in CYP2C19 that is linked to the loss of enzymatic function and decreased active clopidogrel metabolite levels, and it varies based on racial and ethnic populations.</li>



<li>A CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele is a variant of the CYP2C19 gene that makes a less functional or nonfunctional enzyme. Compared to non-carriers, CYP2C19 loss-of-function carriers treated with clopidogrel have increased platelet aggregation (platelets clump together). They also have increased blockage of blood flow events, especially after percutaneous coronary intervention, acute coronary syndromes and stroke.</li>



<li>The oral P2Y12 inhibitor drugs ticagrelor or prasugrel are not dependent on CYP2C19 for its activation. CYP2C19 loss-of-function carriers when treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel have significantly reduced cumulative blockage of blood clotting events compared to those treated with clopidogrel. The CYP2C19 genotype is an important determinant of the significant reduction in blood clotting events observed with ticagrelor or prasugrel drug therapy compared to clopidogrel.</li>
</ul>



<p>Therefore, approximately 70% of patients who do not have the loss-of-function CYP2C19 genetic variants can safely take clopidogrel, while the 30% of patients who do have it can be prescribed alternative drugs such as prasugrel or ticagrelor. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"This precision medicine approach allows physicians to use this information to guide treatment decisions," says Dr. Pereira. "The extensive clinical evidence supports CYP2C19 genetic testing, especially for patients with heart attacks and those who have undergone angioplasty or stent procedures."</p>



<p>Whether clinicians request CYP2C19 genetic testing to guide the use of antiplatelet drugs will depend on several guidelines, including recently published evidence, adoption of point-of-care genetic testing, timely availability of results, integration of results in the electronic health record, education to support understanding and interpretation of results and reimbursement by insurance companies.</p>

<p>About 1 in 500 people have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinic/overview/ovc-20442502#:~:text=People%20seen%20in%20the%20Mayo,cardiomyopathy%20affects%20each%20person%20differently." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).</a> It's a condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick. HCM is one of the most common causes of sudden death among young athletes and otherwise healthy adults.</p>



<p>Recently, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released new guidelines.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ommen-steve-r-m-d/bio-20053861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Steve Ommen</a>, medical director of the Mayo Clinic Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Clinic and chair of the guideline's writing committee, says with exercise and proper medication management, patients can return to their normal daily routines.</p>

<p>In the past, athletes and other patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were told to sit on the sidelines. But it may be time to get back into the game.</p>



<p>"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should not be an automatic disqualification from pursuing sports," says Dr. Ommen.</p>



<p>He says patients with HCM might benefit from being active.</p>



<p>"Our current recommendations are that patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy participate in low to moderate intensity exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle, and that it's reasonable for them to do more vigorous activities as well," says Dr. Ommen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/Woman-hiking16x9-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Happy, smiling woman walking with her phone while outdoors on path, Black/African American woman, outdoors, exercising, walk, exercise, hiking" class="wp-image-348268" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/Woman-hiking16x9-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/Woman-hiking16x9-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/Woman-hiking16x9-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/Woman-hiking16x9-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/Woman-hiking16x9.jpeg 1601w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can benefit from moderate exercise.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new class of medications is on the roster, giving patients more options to manage their disease.</p>



<p>"Usually, there's some simple medications the patient may try first, and then if that's not effective, then they will have an option of this medication, an older medication called disopyramide; an operation called<br>surgical myectomy; or a catheter-based solution, alcohol septal ablation," explains Dr. Ommen.</p>



<p>It's a good idea to check with your healthcare team before making changes to medications or daily routines.</p>



<p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy symptoms include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Chest pain, especially while exercising.</li>



<li>Fainting during or after physical activity.</li>



<li>Shortness of breath during exercise.</li>



<li>Heart palpitations or rapid heartbeats.</li>

<p>"There are different ages that women can go into menopause. And that impacts heart health as well," says Dr. Shufelt.</p>



<p>Different ages because there are different ways you can go into menopause.</p>



<p>"Menopause can be natural, or it can be surgical removal of the ovaries. It doesn't necessarily mean removal of the uterus. It just means removal of the ovaries," she says.</p>



<p>Medication or therapies, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy,</a>&nbsp;can induce menopause as well.</p>



<p>"The earlier a woman goes into menopause, whether it's natural or whether it's surgically induced, or whether it's chemotherapy or medication induced, the higher the risk for future heart attacks are," says Dr. Shufelt.</p>



<p>And that's an ideal time to get your heart health assessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rich Bugay had an appointment with the </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology</strong></a><strong> at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on a Monday, where he had hoped to get answers and relief for what he thought was refractory <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-healthcare-expert-explains-why-reflux-disease-isnt-just-heartburn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acid reflux </a>— until his doctor discovered a heart murmur. The next morning, Rich was told he had congenital heart disease and a severely dilated aorta that could rupture. Just two days later, Rich underwent lifesaving heart surgery. After a whirlwind four days, Rich was on the road to recovery.<br>___________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>



<p>Rich Bugay, an HVAC business owner, husband, and father to two children, hadn't been feeling well for over a year. What started out as sinus issues gradually turned into severe acid reflux and exhaustion, making it hard for Rich to get through the workday.</p>



<p>"I wasn't feeling well — I had a lot of acid reflux and stomach discomfort. I had been going to a lot of different doctor visits, like my family practitioner, and I wasn't getting any answers," says Rich. "And so, at some point, I decided I wanted to go to the best place I could go."</p>

<p>Rich and his wife, Lori, left their house in Escanaba, Michigan, and drove more than six hours to Mayo Clinic in Rochester for an appointment with Dr. Houssam Halawi, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist.</p>



<p>During the appointment, Dr. Halawi listened to Rich's history, concerns and symptoms.</p>



<p>"And what caught my attention was, he had a lot of different symptoms that didn't really belong in the GI (gastrointestinal) world," says Dr. Halawi. "And at that point, in my mind, I was thinking this is not an acid reflux problem."</p>

<p>When Dr. Halawi listened to Rich's heart, he heard a suspicious murmur. He knew something — potentially big — was going on, and he recommended that Rich receive an urgent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856#:~:text=An%20echocardiogram%20uses%20sound%20waves%20to%20create%20pictures%20of%20the,disease%20and%20other%20heart%20conditions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>. An echocardiogram is a common test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart to find heart disease and other heart conditions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich was hesitant to have the echocardiogram since he just wanted some relief from his presumed acid reflux and didn't think he had a life-threatening issue.</p>



<p>Knowing that Rich would most likely go home if the echocardiogram couldn't be scheduled quickly, Dr. Halawi asked the scheduling team if there was any way they could arrange the echocardiogram for the next day. When the scheduler asked, "Would tomorrow morning work for you?" Dr. Halawi didn't expect it to be that quick.</p>



<p>Rich and Lori decided to stay at Mayo Clinic for the echocardiogram the next morning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-388596" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Jain meeting with Rich</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Confirming suspicions</h2>



<p>Kylie Marvin, the sonographer who performed the echocardiogram, immediately noticed something was seriously wrong. She walked out into the hallway and informed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jain-c-charles-m-d/bio-20543120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Charles Jain</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, about her findings.</p>



<p>"His aorta was severely dilated, well over what we would traditionally consider as the surgical cutoff for elective intervention," says Dr. Jain.</p>



<p>A severely enlarged aorta — the pipe that delivers blood out of the heart — could have acute complications, such as a rupture, which can be life-threatening.</p>



<p>The echocardiogram also showed that Rich had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bicuspid-aortic-valve/cdc-20385577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bicuspid aortic valve</a>.</p>



<p>The aortic valve usually has three cusps. A bicuspid valve has only two cusps. Rich's bicuspid valve wasn't closing tightly, which was causing blood to flow backward.</p>



<p>Dr. Jain called a radiologist and arranged an urgent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> for Rich that same day. The results of the CT scan confirmed the findings, and Dr. Jain called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bagameri-gabor-m-d/bio-20384030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gabor Bagameri,</a> a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular surgeon, who was willing to make room in his schedule to quickly see Rich and arrange for surgery.</p>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic, the needs of the patient always come first, and even in the middle of the night, 24/7, you can always reach for help," says Dr. Bagameri.</p>



<p>He encouraged Rich that his heart problems were fixable and advised him not to wait to undergo surgery.</p>



<p>"He let me think about it and came back into the room about five minutes later and he says, 'OK, so we're going to do this Thursday, right?' I say, 'You know it.' And he says, 'I knew you were going to say that!' So, we were ready," says Rich.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"Like a well-oiled machine<strong>"</strong></h2>



<p>On the day of the surgery, Rich said everything was very structured and organized. The surgery itself was a success, as was his hospital stay.</p>



<p>"Like a well-oiled machine, everything just went so well, so smoothly," says Lori. "I've never experienced anything like that before, and that's how healthcare should be everywhere. Everyone deserves to be treated like they do here."</p>



<p>Now, nearly six months after his procedure, Rich feels almost 100% better.</p>



<p>"They saved my life," says Rich. "I'm a completely different person — I feel like a million bucks. I can do what I want to do, and my energy levels are much better."</p>



<p>Looking back on the experience, Dr. Halawi recognizes that Rich wouldn't have had such a positive outcome without every single person involved at Mayo Clinic. Dr. Jain echoes that sentiment, "When there are patients who are having a significant abnormality, particularly with urgency, such as Rich's, everything is already set up for teamwork to be natural, and fortunately, this makes it all relatively seamless."</p>



<p>Reflecting on his healthcare journey, Rich says that you need to advocate for yourself.</p>



<p>"If you haven’t been feeling right for a long time and feel like you're not getting answers, come to Mayo Clinic because they'll get to the bottom of it," says Rich.</p>

Understanding and managing these risks can help prevent both conditions.</p>



<p>“We target things like high blood pressure, hypertension, high cholesterol or hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, obstructive sleep apnea. We think about things like physical inactivity and obesity," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/english-stephen-w-jr-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20491968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stephen English</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/neurology/home/orc-20117057?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurologist</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. English says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a>, a type of heart disease causing an abnormal heart rhythm, contributes to nearly 20% of stroke cases.</p>



<p>"Atrial fibrillation is something we can modify with medications based on the burden of your atrial fibrillation," he says.</p>

<p>Not all risks for heart disease and stroke can be modified — for example, getting older.</p>



<p>"Even perfectly healthy people, as we age, develop changes, so our blood vessels become stiffer over time. And we're more at risk of developing things like atrial fibrillation as we age," says Dr. English.</p>
