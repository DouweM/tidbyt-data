<p>Normally, hearing about a senior with hip problems would not be very surprising. But the senior you're about to meet is a senior in high school. Thanks to Mayo Clinic, this young woman has a bright future that's all teed up.</p>



<p>There's nothing like the sound of a solidly struck drive. Growing up in a golf family, it's a sound that Maddy Trapnell has heard a lot of. But it was a different sound that she says had her worried about her golfing future. "It would clunk, like, over and over again."</p>



<p>That "clunking," as she puts it, was coming from Maddy's hip. Like golf, hip problems run in her family. Maddy says her symptoms started when she was 14. Then, in the fall of 2022, her junior year of high school, she says her symptoms got worse. "My coaches started taking me out of tournaments because, like, I refused to stop. But they took me out because it's like, 'You're in pain. You need to stop.'"</p>

<p>After seeing a few local doctors, Maddy came to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, where she met with orthopedic surgeon, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grigoriou-emmanouil-m-d/bio-20538675?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Emmanouil Grigoriou</a>. "So Maddy's case is unique because she had pathology both inside her hip joint, as well as outside the hip joint around the hip with how her bones were formed."</p>



<p>Understandably, Maddy says she was worried about her future. "Like, I was just worried, like, what's my senior year going to look like? Like, am I going to be able to play? Is this pain ever going to go away?"</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="577" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Maddy3-16x9-1-1024x577.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-387604" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Maddy3-16x9-1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Maddy3-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Maddy3-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Maddy3-16x9-1-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Maddy3-16x9-1-2048x1153.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Dr. Grigoriou explains why was able to get back on the course so quickly. "We're able to do both procedures in the same setting, which is very, very important for the patients and allows them to return back to what they love, faster. We're able to do both the hip arthroscopy and the periacetabular osteotomy; the same setting on the same day with a single anesthesia event, a single recovery, a single rehabilitation — one and done."</p>



<p>Less than six months after surgery and just weeks before her senior season was due to start, Maddy was cleared to start playing again. Maddy says it took a little while to get back into the swing of things. "I started being very consistent again and started having fun again. And yeah, I was excited. It was great."</p>



<p>And a senior season that was once in jeopardy, ended with a top-10 finish at the state tournament. Recently, Maddy was back at Mayo to have three screws, the last reminder of her surgery, removed. </p>

<p>While uncertain about her competitive golfing future, Maddy says she has her eye on college and something else that runs in the family. "What’s next is I'm planning to attend the University of North Dakota for mechanical and aerospace engineering. I love airplanes. I love flying. I love looking at them. I think they're fascinating. And so, I just want to do something that I know I'm going to enjoy and I'm passionate about."</p>



<p>Just like her golf game.</p>

<p>Whether you're a pro or biking for fun, there are common injuries all cyclists might experience.</p>



<p>"The first one is a traumatic injury if somebody falls off a bike," says Dr. Kakar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Common breaks from traumatic injury include wrist fractures.</p>



<p>"We also see overuse-type injuries. So, for example, we see patients where they're pressing on the brakes for too long, squeezing hard, putting pressure on their palm, and their hands sometimes fall asleep — called numbness and tingling," Dr. Kakar says.</p>



<p>He says it could be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355603?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>, a condition you don't want to ignore.</p>



<p>"If you have numbness and tingling in the fingers, it is something I wouldn't ignore because if you have carpal tunnel, we worry about that," Dr. Kakar explains. </p>



<p>The numbness and tingling can become permanent and result in the loss of muscle strength</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevent bike injuries</h2>



<p>"There are simple preventive measures you can take," says Dr. Kakar. "Having thicker grips so you're not squeezing as hard can also help. Bike gloves help as well and sometimes puts your wrist in a better position than putting pressure on your palm.&nbsp;"</p>

<p>A common pickleball injury is a traumatic one — like a broken wrist.</p>



<p>"Sometimes the patients are a little bit older, they may have undiagnosed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">osteoporosis</a>, they fall over, they break their wrist, and we see actually a lot of those injuries," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>He says players can also face problems from overuse.</p>



<p>"For example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tendinitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378243?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tendinitis&nbsp;</a>type of injuries that when somebody plays, they're not conditioned to it," he says.</p>

<p>The goal is to prevent those type of problems in the first place. Dr. Kakar says to think of these three P's when heading to the court.</p>



<p>"Properly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/stretching/art-20546848?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warming</a>&nbsp;up, having proper equipment and also proper form," he explains.</p>



<p>Warm up by doing stretches before taking your first swing.</p>



<p>"It's not tennis, it's not squash, it's its own sport. So having proper equipment is important such as having a proper paddle, which is thicker so you are not gripping as hard," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>And when it comes to proper form, consider taking a lesson.</p>

<p>From ice bucket challenges to polar plunges, people have embraced being doused with or dunked in icy water to raise money for their favorite causes. But can cold water immersion have benefits beyond fundraising?</p>



<p>Research indicates that icy water may have a positive effect on recovery after exercise by reducing inflammation and soreness. It also may help build resiliency, restore balance to the nervous system and improve cognitive function and mood.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the basics of cold-water immersion?</h2>



<p>A cold plunge or cold water immersion involves partially or totally submerging yourself in cold water for a few minutes at a time. It can be as simple as sitting in a bathtub filled with cold water and ice cubes or jumping into a cold lake or the ocean. You also can go to a cold-plunge center or create or buy your own cold-plunge tank, which, if it has all the options, can cost up to $20,000.</p>



<p>Be sure not to plunge into icy waters that have a current, such as a river, to avoid being swept downstream or trapped under ice.</p>



<p>Water should be 50 F or colder. Keep in mind that the water in a frozen lake will be much colder. That's why it's a good idea to measure the temperature before you jump in. The plunge can be done as one continuous session or multiple sessions with breaks between the sessions. Typically, cold-water plungers start with 30 seconds to a minute and work up to five to 10 minutes at a time.</p>



<p>Researchers are still determining the optimum process and timing for cold-water immersion sessions.</p>



<p>You can do cold plunging every day. However, if you're doing it after training, daily plunges could compromise the potential for long-term performance improvements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the benefits for workout recovery or athletic performance?</h2>



<p>Research on cold water immersion has found evidence that it helps reduce the degree of exercise-induced muscle damage that can occur after physically challenging activities. Less damage leads to less inflammation, which in turn reduces soreness and helps restore physical performance the next day.</p>



<p>These benefits may be the result of rapid constriction of the blood vessels due to the cold water. The cold can trigger responses in your body, such as decreased metabolic activity, alterations in hormone production and blood flow, and activation of the immune system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the drawbacks of cold plunges?</h2>



<p>The most obvious drawback is the cold and discomfort, although frequent plungers report becoming more comfortable and tolerant of the cold with regular exposure. Depending on the environment, such as plunging into an ice and snow covered lake, you also may be at risk for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frostbite/symptoms-causes/syc-20372656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frostbite</a>. Too long exposure also can lead to hypothermia, so make sure you have towels and warm clothing close at hand if you're doing cold plunges outdoors.</p>



<p>For athletes, cold water immersion may affect different types of training in different ways. For those engaged in resistance training, cold water may turn down the molecular signaling pathways that are normally activated after exercise. This may hinder long-term improvements in strength, muscle growth and performance. However, cold-water immersion doesn't appear to negatively affect endurance training in the same way.</p>



<p>If you want to give cold water immersion a try, start by consulting an expert, such as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers?service=Sports%20Medicine">sports medicine specialist</a>, to ensure you're plunging appropriately and following the right protocol. If you have risk factors associated with <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/cardiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a>, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/know-your-numbers-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a>, check with your <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers?service=Sports%20Medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary care provider</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/cardiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> so you know it's safe for you to cold plunge.</p>

<p>PHOENIX — For snowbirds who need joint replacement surgery, places like Arizona and Florida offer an enticing prospect in the dead of winter — the opportunity to recuperate in a warmer climate without fear of slipping and falling on ice.</p>



<p>Snowbirds are people who typically seek out warm winter climates to escape Arctic-like conditions at home, but there are also benefits from a medical standpoint. Regaining mobility after joint replacement is an important milestone for patients, and walking is one way to help them get there. Think flat sidewalks instead of potholes or bumps in your path caused by ice and snow melting and refreezing.</p>



<p>"After joint replacement, we strongly encourage patients to walk, walk, walk and gradually increase their activities," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/spangehl-mark-j-m-d/bio-20054096?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Spangehl, M.D.</a>, an orthopedic surgeon and chair of the Adult Reconstruction Division at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>. "We get some rain occasionally, but for the most part, they can be outside every day that they want to be outside. And that's part of the recovery."</p>



<p>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Phoenix's average temperature is 68 degrees in December and January, 72 degrees in February, and 77 degrees in March. In Jacksonville, the location of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, the average temperature is 68 degrees in December, 66 degrees in January, 69 degrees in February, and 75 degrees in March.</p>

<p>Planning is essential for any surgery, but it's especially important for a surgery <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/international?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">away from home</a>. If patients get on the surgical schedule earlier during their stays, they have the rest of their time to recuperate. Patients come a few days before surgery to meet with their surgeon and learn more about what to expect before, during and after the procedure. The surgeon also will go over any potential risks and complications, which are small. After surgery, patients can expect to receive some follow-up care in person, Dr. Spangehl says.</p>



<p>How long patients need to stay nearby the hospital to recover after surgery depends on the person. People who are fit and active may not need to stay as long as someone with comorbidities that affect their mobility. Those comorbidities include having arthritis in other joints, Parkinson's disease, or heart or lung issues that affect stamina.</p>



<p>After surgery, patients should plan to have appropriate support — such as a family member — available nearby, Dr. Spangehl says.</p>



<p>"If you're traveling some distance for the procedure, you'll need someone who you're comfortable with and who can be there for a while to help you after surgery," he says.</p>



<p>Typically, once the person is mobile and can get around safely, they can return home, Dr. Spangehl says.</p>



<p>Mayo's snowbird connection to Arizona goes back decades. During their retirement years in the 1930s, Mayo Clinic's founders, brothers William J. Mayo, M.D., and Charles H. Mayo, M.D., and their wives headed to Arizona when the Minnesota winter set in. Their love of the Southwest came full circle when Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, opened in 1987.</p>

<p>When winter storms hit, good balance can prevent falls and injuries — ranging from broken arms, legs or hips to back injuries and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/concussion/symptoms-causes/syc-20355594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concussions</a>.</p>



<p>The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control says slips and falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injury across all age groups, except the 10–24 group. One in every 5 falls results in a serious injury, such as head trauma or broken bones. That’s more than 800,000 people being hospitalized each year.</p>



<p>To remain upright and steady, the even distribution of weight over your feet is vital. Many parts of your body play key roles in your&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/balance-problems/symptoms-causes/syc-20350474" target="_blank">balance</a>. Muscles, bones, joints, eyes, the balance organ in the inner ear, nerves, heart and blood vessels must work normally to maintain your balance. When these systems aren't functioning well, balance problems can arise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Keeping your balance no matter the weather</h2>



<p>Your arms are one of the greatest aids in maintaining your balance, especially when it's icy. Start with your hands, and wear gloves. Gloves keep your hands warm and out of your pockets, which frees up your arms so you can extend them out from your sides to improve your ability to stay upright.</p>



<p>Your feet also aid in balance. Assume that all wet, dark areas on pavements are slippery and icy. Slow down, take short, careful steps at first, and then adjust your pace to surface conditions. Or walk like a penguin. Point your feet slightly outward, and put your center of gravity directly over your feet as much as possible.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Other tips to tackle tricky walking conditions include:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Use a backpack or a cross-body bag when carrying something to free up your hands.&nbsp;If you need to carry groceries or heavy bags, take them one at a time.</li>



<li>Wear winter assistive devices with built-in grippers over your shoes or boots. Or wear lace-up shoes that fit well and have deep-grooved, nonskid, rubber treads.</li>



<li>Wipe your shoes and boots thoroughly on the floor mat when coming inside.</li>



<li>Use a cane or walking poles when out in winter weather.</li>



<li>Avoid texting when walking on snow or ice. It can be an accident waiting to happen.</li>



<li>Get in and out of your vehicle slowly, holding onto the door and steering wheel while stepping on or off a slippery surface.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting back on your feet</h2>



<p>If you do fall, make sure you're not injured. Then, roll onto your hands and knees. Take one foot and place it between your hands, then bring the other foot between your hands. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, and push yourself up from there.</p>



<p>If you think you might be hurt or are unsure if an injury is serious, seek medical care immediately.</p>



<p>Once you've recovered, think back on the fall and ask yourself: "What was I doing?" and "What could I have done differently to help prevent that fall from happening?"</p>

<p>"But we didn't have a way to easily translate that plan, which is very accurate, to the operating room", says Dr. Sanchez-Sotelo, division chair of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>That is, until now. Recently, he performed the first-ever mixed reality navigated shoulder replacement surgery. Specially designed tools and goggles create a highly accurate hologram of the joint. He says that together, they "allow us to place a component exactly where it belongs."</p>



<p>And that’s important, he adds, because "placing the implant exactly where it belongs has a direct impact on complications, outcomes and longevity."</p>



<p>Dr. Sanchez-Sotelo has seen a lot of change over his career. But he says this may be the most exciting. "This technology is going to allow us to do things that were unthinkable before."</p>

<p>Many people promise to exercise more in the new year, but jump-starting your workout routine can be challenging if you've been sitting on the couch for a while. It can seem like a daunting task.</p>

<p>Starting a workout program or being physically active takes motivation and commitment. The key is to start slowly and do something you take pleasure in.</p>



<p>"If you hate swimming, don't try to start to become a swimmer. But (if) you enjoy dancing or other activities (such as) gardening, those are forms of activity that once you engage in, you increase your consistency and compliance that will have the most health benefits," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-1024x576.jpg" alt="a smiling older woman seated on a yoga mat, doing stretches" class="wp-image-256796" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/12/a-smiling-older-woman-seated-on-a-yoga-mat-doing-stretches-16X9-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Being active can build muscle strength and improve cognitive and cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>"Three percent or 30 minutes a day of our waking hours, if we commit that to physical activity, will have huge benefits," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>And for those young at heart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.</p>



<p>"As we get older, dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips to get started and stick with a workout plan:</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Research workout routines.</li>



<li>Schedule your workouts.</li>



<li>Find an exercise buddy.</li>



<li>Be consistent.</li>
</ul>

<p>"The scientific name that we give it is adhesive capsulitis, and, basically, it's a condition when the shoulder gets tight and you can't move it very well," says Dr. Camp. </p>



<p>He says frozen shoulder happens when the lining that goes around the shoulder joint gets inflamed, possibly the result of a small injury. It thickens over time, forming scar tissue.</p>



<p>"Frozen shoulder exists in three stages, and the symptoms and treatment options depend on which stage you're in. So the first one is an inflammatory stage," says Dr. Camp.</p>



<p>That's the painful stage. Rest and steroid injections may help. The second stage is when the shoulder is less painful but starts to stiffen. Physical therapy works well then. The third phase …</p>



<p>"… is what we call thawing, which means it finally starts to relax, loosen up and gain motion back again," says Dr. Camp.</p>



<p>If it doesn't resolve in six to 12 months, surgery may be an option.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I was playing a pickup game of football with my kids, took a tumble, and my kneecap made a popping sound. It really hurt, then seemed to get better, but something's not right. Any idea what might be going on?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>If your kneecap pops or slides to the outside of your knee, you'll definitely know that something's going on. Typically, that "something" is a partial or full dislocation, which means the kneecap, also known as the patella, has slipped partly or all the way out of its groove over the knee joint.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-dislocation/basics/art-20056693?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Dislocation</a> can be caused by a sudden blow, such as taking a hard hit playing a contact sport like football or hockey, or by a chronic condition, such as a stretched ligament. Some people have a particular knee anatomy that makes it more common. In those cases, a dislocation could be caused by something as simple as normal walking or standing up from a chair. With chronic dislocation, it may feel as though your knee is buckling or giving way. There's often no pattern or regular causes of the dislocations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens when a kneecap dislocates?</strong></h2>



<p>When the <a href="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/condition/multi-ligament-injuries-knee-dislocation/">kneecap dislocates</a>, it's painful, and the knee area may swell. Whether it happens from an acute or chronic situation, dislocation can damage the cartilage of the groove that the kneecap sits in or the cartilage underneath the kneecap.</p>



<p>Acute or chronic dislocation indicates you have a stretched or torn medial patellofemoral ligament, or MPFL, a tough band of tissue that connects to the inside of the kneecap and prevents it from sliding to the outside of the knee.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treating acute dislocation</strong></h2>



<p>If the dislocation is caused by an acute injury, you may be able to ease the kneecap back into place, or you may need to go an emergency department where healthcare professionals can correct the dislocation and evaluate if there's additional injury to your knee. Following the dislocation, you should see an orthopedic specialist.</p>



<p>An X-ray provides an overall view of the anatomy of the kneecap and knee joint. The orthopedic specialist can determine if there is damage to the groove the kneecap rests in, how high the kneecap sits above the joint and if the patellar tendon, which connects below the kneecap, is pulling to one side.</p>



<p>If this is the first time your kneecap has dislocated, the X-ray also can help determine if you're at risk of it happening again. Your orthopedic specialist also may order an MRI to check if a piece of the cartilage has broken off.</p>



<p>Younger patients may need to undergo surgery to remove or fix a cartilage piece that has broken off and reconstruct the MPFL. Recovery following surgery typically involves wearing a brace, physical therapy and limited weight bearing to give the cartilage the best chance to heal. It may take up to six months before you're able to fully return to sports.</p>



<p>For older patients, cartilage is less likely to heal, so surgery isn't always recommended. However, if you're experiencing a catching sensation in your knee, an orthopedic surgeon may decide to surgically remove the piece of cartilage. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/physical-medicine-rehabilitation-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20467039?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Rehabilitation</a> will include limited weight bearing, using a brace and physical therapy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treating chronic dislocation</strong></h2>



<p>The first time your knee dislocates — unrelated to an injury — it may slide back into place on its own. However, you should see an orthopedic specialist who can evaluate if there has been any injury to the cartilage and determine your risk for dislocations happening again. If there isn't any cartilage damage, the orthopedic specialist may order physical therapy to strengthen your hip and quadricep muscles. This can help overcome any stretch in the MPFL ligament and stabilize your kneecap, as well as decrease the risk of arthritis over time.</p>



<p>However, you eventually still may require surgery to reconstruct the MPFL, as well as other procedures to correct chronic dislocations. These include deepening the groove where the kneecap sits or moving the location where the patellar tendon connects.</p>



<p>Recovery from MPFL reconstruction may take several months before you're able to return to normal activities and regain your range of motion. Overall recovery for more complex surgeries may take four to six months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preventing kneecap dislocations</strong></h2>



<p>The best way to lessen your chance of acute and chronic kneecap dislocations is to maintain overall leg, quadricep and hip strength. For chronic dislocations, learn what tends to cause them, such as twisting, and avoid those motions. A physical therapist also can work with you to improve overall leg strength and teach you how to correct a kneecap dislocation on your own.</p>



<p>For athletes who have suffered an acute dislocation, prompt care, possible surgery and rehabilitation can get you back to playing again. <em>— </em><strong><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/doug-bartels-md">Dr. Douglas Bartels</a>, Orthopedics &amp; Orthopedic Surgery, Sports Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire"><strong><em>Eau Claire, Wisconsin</em></strong></a></p>
