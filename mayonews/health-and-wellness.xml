<p>Uterine fibroids are the leading cause of women undergoing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3874080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hysterectomies</a>, leaving them unable to bear children.</p>



<p>Fibroids often are diagnosed in women between 20 and 40. They can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pain and infertility.</p>

<p>Fibroids are muscular tumors that grow in the walls of the uterus. In most cases, they're benign.</p>



<p>"Even small fibroids, depending on their locations, can cause menstrual irregularities or heavy menstrual periods," says Dr. Louie.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1000" height="562" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_584151868_Fotor-16x9.jpg" alt="a young woman bending over and holding her stomach in pain, maybe abdominal or menstrual cramps" class="wp-image-191970" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_584151868_Fotor-16x9.jpg 1000w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_584151868_Fotor-16x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_584151868_Fotor-16x9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>She says a newer, minimally invasive treatment called radiofrequency ablation effectively removes fibroids.</p>



<p>"This technology is really good for fibroids within the wall of the uterus because those traditionally would have required us to make an incision in the uterine tissue in order to remove and treat the fibroid," says Dr. Louie.</p>



<p>Doctors insert a needlelike device into the fibroid, sending radiofrequency heat waves to target fibroids.</p>



<p>"Using energy to break down the fibroid tissue, and that causes the fibroids to shrink and become less productive of symptoms," explains Dr. Louie.</p>



<p>Best of all, there's little to no downtime after the procedure.</p>



<p>"This is the fastest recovery time I think we can offer for treating fibroid-related symptoms," says Dr. Louie.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Uterine fibroid symptoms</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Pain during sex.</li>



<li>Pelvic pain or pressure.</li>



<li>Heavy or prolonged menstrual periods.</li>



<li>Frequent urination.</li>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leapfrog Group's Hospital Safety Score</a> is updated and published twice a year. The score is based on 15 measures of publicly available hospital safety data, combined with 12 self-reported survey answers to produce a single safety score. A panel of patient safety experts developed the measures for the score.</p>



<p>The Leapfrog Group's survey assesses the status of many hospital practice areas, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Electronic medication ordering.</li>



<li>Staffing of ICUs by critical care medical professionals.</li>



<li>Structures and systems to provide a culture that supports safety.</li>



<li>Practices to monitor and maintain safe nursing workforce levels.</li>



<li>Monitoring proper hand hygiene techniques of staff who interact with patients.</li>



<li>Monitoring the use of barcode scanning of patients and medications when administering medications in the hospital.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Leapfrog Group is one of many groups that recognize Mayo Clinic as a top choice for patients. Mayo Clinic is the only healthcare organization that consistently ranks among the top providers nationwide regardless of the quality measure used.</p>

<p>Every day, people take more than 23,000 breaths that fill their lungs with 2,000 gallons of air. It's an automatic and essential function that most people don't think about — until that breathing becomes difficult.</p>



<p>Marie Hammes knows this feeling well. The 70-year-old West Salem, Wisconsin, resident was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COPD</a>, in 1996. This chronic inflammatory lung disease causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. She handled her condition without extra oxygen until 2008, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pneumonia</a>&nbsp;made breathing harder.</p>



<p>For the next 10 years, Marie used a stationary oxygen concentrator overnight at home and portable oxygen tanks when away from home. In 2018, a health insurance plan change led her to seek a new oxygen supplier. That's when she met Jaclyn Dunnum, a respiratory therapist and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/home-medical-equipment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Store</a>&nbsp;assistant manager in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/home-medical-equipment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Crosse</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting patient needs</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic Store is a convenient supplier of durable medical equipment for patients recovering at home from an illness or accident or managing a chronic health condition like COPD.</p>



<p>Jaclyn explains that getting necessary medical equipment can feel overwhelming and complicated. Usually, the need is triggered by a medical condition that can feel scary and affect daily activities.</p>



<p>"Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, 'I am going to go get oxygen' or 'I want a bed and a walker,'" she says. "It is our job to make life easier by providing patients some normalcy in needing medical equipment."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Store staff accomplish this by educating patients and their families about their options and helping them select the least intrusive, but most beneficial, equipment for daily living needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Helping Marie breathe easier</h2>



<p>After discussing the options with Jaclyn, Marie decided to continue using a stationary concentrator at night and switched to a portable oxygen concentrator for times away from home. She was happy with how the portable concentrator made it easier to navigate when away from home.</p>



<p>"A portable oxygen concentrator is a small device that she can carry in a shoulder bag or backpack that pulls atmospheric air into the unit and creates medical-grade oxygen," says Jaclyn. "This allows Marie to be safe outside her home and keep her blood oxygen levels at the appropriate level."</p>



<p>Marie primarily uses supplemental oxygen while venturing outside and each night during sleep.</p>



<p>"I would never be able to walk through an entire store without the portable. It has made my ability to move where I want to much easier," she says. "It keeps my brain working well too. The portable is so much nicer to take places because I used to run into everything with the tanks."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">No unimportant questions</h2>



<p>The support Marie feels extends beyond the equipment she has received. Over the years, she has learned that she can depend on Jaclyn to answer her questions quickly and compassionately, whether they are big or small.</p>



<p>"I never feel like I ask a stupid question. She takes it in and answers it — no problem."</p>



<p>That's an important part of the job says Jaclyn.</p>



<p>"Durable medical equipment can be hard to navigate if you don't know the questions to ask or who to ask. I would not be doing my job as a healthcare worker if I did not make sure she was safe and getting what she needed to be safe in her home."</p>



<p>Marie is grateful for this personalized attention.</p>



<p>"They have been wonderful with me. Ask any question, and they are more than willing to try to answer it. It truly helps to know that I have them to rely on if or when needed."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Celebrating every milestone</h2>



<p>There's little slowing down for Marie. Recently, she marked her 70th&nbsp;birthday with her typical month-long celebration.</p>



<p>"I think every year is a milestone and worth a party," she laughs. "Age doesn't bother me, and having my oxygen helps me to celebrate."</p>



<p>Her attitude inspires Jaclyn and the Mayo Clinic Store staff.</p>



<p>"Marie is so fun to work with. She's a busy lady, and I'm glad the equipment keeps her that way," says Jaclyn. "She advocates for herself, and our team will always support whatever she needs."</p>

She says you should get vaccinated well before the holidays because it takes two weeks for the flu vaccine to become fully effective.</p>

<p>Health experts say you should get your flu shot as soon as it's available in your area. This will give your body time to create defenses against the flu.</p>



<p>"It takes two weeks to get protection against influenza. So, if you're exposed to influenza in that meantime, you may get an infection," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>And you also may spread a virus. Dr. Mattke says the vaccine doesn't completely prevent illness.</p>



<p>"What it does is offer you protection against really serious complications: needing to go to the emergency department, needing to be admitted, going to the ICU or, in some serious situations, death," she says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Two flu shots for some children</h3>



<p>Some children 6 months to age 8 may need two flu shots. It’s important to work with your healthcare team.</p>



<p>"But if it's your infant's first year of being eligible for the influenza vaccine, I would anticipate that they get two vaccines separated by four weeks," Dr. Mattke says.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>

<p>If your child is scared of vaccinations, there is an alternative to the shot for some kids.&nbsp;The flu mist is approved for people ages 2 to 49.</p>



<p>The flu vaccine, she says, can save lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"In children specifically, the influenza vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of death by over 75%. And so, for my children, I want to do everything I can to try and give them as much protection as possible against influenza," Dr. Mattke says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hand hygiene</h3>



<p>In addition to getting vaccinated, it's important to keep your hands clean and avoid contact with sick people to stay healthy and prevent the spread of illnesses. Help children learn the when and how of hand-washing. Encourage them to wash their hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before meals, after visiting the restroom, and following sneezing or coughing.</p>

<p>Many parts of the U.S. – and the world — will soon "fall back" as daylight saving time ends and clocks fall back one hour. This year, the change takes place in the U.S. at 2 a.m. local time on Sunday, Nov. 5. That means an extra hour of sleep – and earlier sunrises and sunsets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does less sun affect your mood and level of energy?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesus-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jesse Bracamonte,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says sunlight can influence the levels of neurochemicals in the brain.</p>

Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/SCRIPT-MCM-Change-in-sunlight-affect-mood-FINAL29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"People can feel more tired with less light due to the neurochemical or brain hormonal changes that occur with a change of season or less light. A common chemical that regulates that is called serotonin," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>But what happens when you have less exposure to the sun and your serotonin levels are off?</p>



<p>"Your mood may be off, your sleep may be off, the way you regulate your mood cycle — whether you're happy or you're feeling a bit down — can be off. And that can have a downstream effect just the way you feel in general," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Bracamonte says there are things you can do to feel better.</p>



<p>"If you can, get sunlight. Get plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-sleep-spoilers-tips-for-a-good-nights-rest/">rest.</a>&nbsp;Get exercise, be active. Make sure to eat a well-balanced diet full of fruits and veggies," he says.</p>



<p>And consider a light therapy lamp. They are designed to simulate natural sunlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/10/woman-sitting-with-a-light-therapy-lamp-for-SAD-or-depression-16x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="woman sitting with a light therapy lamp for SAD or depression" class="wp-image-104807" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/10/woman-sitting-with-a-light-therapy-lamp-for-SAD-or-depression-16x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/10/woman-sitting-with-a-light-therapy-lamp-for-SAD-or-depression-16x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/10/woman-sitting-with-a-light-therapy-lamp-for-SAD-or-depression-16x9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Using light therapy can help with mood </figcaption></figure>



<p>"In many cases, I do recommend light therapy for people who aren't getting enough sun to help with mood and balance those neurochemicals out. It's one of the treatments for improving moods, particularly during the gloomy season," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Help your mood with good sleep</h3>



<p>As the time change date approaches, here are two things you can do to alleviate the sleep disturbance that may come along with it.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Adjust your internal clock gradually</strong><br>In the days leading up to the time change, adjust your sleep and wake times in small increments so your body can transition gradually. Shift your bedtime and wake time in 15- to 30-minute increments.</li>



<li><strong>Spend time outdoors</strong><br>Sunlight affects your body's circadian rhythm, and spending time outdoors can alleviate feelings of fatigue that often accompany time changes.</li>

<p>Factors that can increase your risk of COPD include exposure to tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asthma</a>; occupational exposure to dust and chemicals; exposure to fumes from burning fuel; and genetics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Symptoms of COPD often don't appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time, particularly if cigarette smoke exposure continues.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of COPD can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shortness of breath.</li>



<li>Wheezing.</li>



<li>Chest tightness.</li>



<li>Chronic cough that may produce clear, white, yellow or green mucus.</li>



<li>Frequent respiratory infections.</li>



<li>Lack of energy.</li>



<li>Unintended weight loss.</li>



<li>Swelling in the ankles, feet or legs.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>If you've been diagnosed with COPD and you smoke, it is important that you quit. Most cases of COPD in the U.S. are directedly related to long-term cigarette smoking. Stopping smoking can prevent COPD from worsening and reducing your ability to breathe.</p>



<p>Many people with&nbsp;COPD&nbsp;have mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than quitting smoking. Even for more advanced stages of the disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353685?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment</a>&nbsp;for COPD can include medications, lung therapies, in-home noninvasive ventilation therapy, managing exacerbations and surgery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Coping</strong></h2>



<p>Living with&nbsp;COPD&nbsp;can be a challenge — especially as it becomes harder to catch your breath. You may have to give up some activities you previously enjoyed. Your family and friends may have difficulty adjusting to some of the changes.</p>



<p>It can help to share your fears and feelings with your family, friends and healthcare team. You also may want to consider joining a support group for people with&nbsp;COPD, and you may benefit from counseling or medication if you feel depressed or overwhelmed.</p>



<p>If you have&nbsp;COPD, these strategies can help you feel better and slow the damage to your lungs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Control your breathing.</strong><br>Talk to your primary healthcare professional or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions, energy conservation techniques and relaxation techniques that you can use when you're short of breath.</li>



<li><strong>Clear your airways.</strong><br>With&nbsp;COPD, mucus tends to collect in your air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier may help.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong><br>It may seem difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance and strengthen your respiratory muscles. Discuss with your healthcare team which activities are appropriate for you.</li>



<li><strong>Eat healthy foods.</strong><br>A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength. If you're underweight, your healthcare professional may recommend nutritional supplements. If you're overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during times of exertion.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid smoke and air pollution.</strong><br>Besides quitting smoking, avoiding places where others smoke is important. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage. Other types of air pollution also can irritate your lungs, so check daily air quality forecasts before going out.</li>



<li><strong>See your healthcare team regularly.</strong><br>Stick to your appointment schedule, even if you're feeling fine. It's important to regularly monitor your lung function and let your healthcare team know if you have worsening symptoms or notice signs of infection. Be sure to get your annual flu vaccine in the fall to help prevent infections that can worsen your&nbsp;COPD and ask your healthcare team when you need the pneumococcal vaccine. </li>

<p>You just got a shot in the arm, and now your arm hurts.</p>



<p>"You can have a little bit of swelling, a little bit of redness, definitely achiness. These are all common," says Dr. Bracamonte. "Most of the time, it lasts about two or three days."</p>



<p>He says, in most cases, those symptoms mean that the vaccine is working.</p>



<p>"It's your body's immune system kind of reacting to the vaccine, which, in general, can be a good thing. So those symptoms are generally pretty mild and very common. It's very unusual that a patient doesn't have some type of slight reaction — a little soreness, a little malaise, maybe feel a little feverish but not with a high fever," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says over-the-counter pain relievers, a heating pad or just staying active can all help with the soreness.</p>



<p>"It can be more severe, such as if you have trouble breathing, swelling, severe redness or pain out of proportion. Then I always encourage my patients to give me a call and let me know what's going on. But those cases are very rare," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<p>You can hear the excitement of Halloween in their voices as kids dress up in their favorite costumes with the hopes of collecting a bounty of candy. Now, what to do with all that sugar?</p>



<p>"I think the first thing I would do is give them a couple of pieces. That seems reasonable, but too much of anything can be a bad thing," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>She says to set a limit, then put the candy away so it is not easily accessible.</p>



<p>"We recommend that they keep a little bit of it, that's fine, but they don't need 5-10 pounds of candy each year because this is certainly going to increase the risk of cavities as well as other things," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>And help avoid an extra dental visit by encouraging good oral hygiene.</p>



<p>"If your kid is having candy, making sure that they are using good brushing and flossing techniques," Dr. Mattke says.</p>



<p>And, along with keeping a few pieces, consider having kids donate the rest of the candy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Some dentists collect candy and ship them overseas to our armed forces. And there are other locations where you could also donate the candy," says Dr. Mattke.</p>

<p>Stress is a physical and psychological reaction to a demand, and that demand can be anything, Dr. Debar says. Stress that is good for us and may even give us a sense of well-being is eustress, the opposite of distress. The same event—for example, getting married—might provoke either one, Dr. Debar says.</p>



<p>"It's about the perception of that stress and how your body is actually handling it," Dr. Debar says. "<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chronic stress</a> will impact every organ system in the body: You might feel anxiety, depression and digestive issues, for example."</p>



<p>Stress prompts a cascade of reactions within the mind and body as you mount a stress response, Dr. Debar says. Under normal stress, a person starts at a baseline of relaxation, encounters a stressor, the stress response begins, rises to a peak, and then comes back down to baseline.</p>



<p>Among the physical changes that may occur when you perceive a threat:</p>



<ul>
<li>The sympathetic nervous system and production of the primary stress hormone, cortisol, activate.<em></em></li>



<li>Thinking becomes negative as you experience or anticipate something bad. Attention becomes hyperfocused on what is happening.<em></em></li>



<li>The heart, lungs and muscles prepare for you to fight or run. There is increased heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate as the body needs to deliver more oxygen to cells. Muscles tense.</li>



<li>The digestive and reproductive systems aren't needed, so their activities slow.</li>



<li>The immune system turns its attention from fighting microscopic invaders such as viruses or cancer cells and goes into an inflammatory mode, increasing its production of proteins called cytokines that adjust this process. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>When someone realizes the threat has passed, the body begins to repair itself from this response and “tidy up”. It shifts to a repair, renew and growth state as the stress response is mopped up. Physically, breathing and heart rate slow down, blood pressure normalizes, you take more expansive breaths, muscular tension eases, the digestive and reproductive systems resume normal activity, and you may begin to connect with others to recount the threat you just experienced, Dr. Debar says<em>.</em></p>



<p>"If you go up in stress and then come back down, you have completed our cycle. There's no wear and tear, there's no damage," Dr. Debar says. "In fact, it's probably good for you because it leads to greater resilience. If you’ve ever overcome a stressful event in life, processed it fully and completed that cycle, then the next similar experience you have, you think, `Oh no, but I can do it.'"</p>



<p>However, when someone is repeatedly under too much stress, the ability to go back to baseline slowly starts to wane, Dr. Debar says.</p>



<p>"You can go up in stress and stay there, having a prolonged response. This is when you're hypervigilant: You're wired but tired, you're anxious," Dr. Debar says. "Or, life has thrown at you so many stressors, that you respond inadequately. It is the lack of recovery rather than the actual stressor itself that is critical. After a while, you may just numb out and show no response."</p>



<p>Sometimes people think it would be good to show no response, Dr. Debar adds, but internally the stress response and its cascade of internal activities are still happening. They are just hidden.</p>



<p>There are several signs that you may be in danger of stress overload and it is time to address it, Dr. Debar says:</p>



<ul>
<li>If stress feels unremitting and constant.</li>



<li>If stress feels uncontrollable and you're unable to relax or feel like you're on autopilot.</li>



<li>If you have problems regulating emotions.</li>



<li>If you start hiding from life and/or people.</li>



<li>You're experiencing physical symptoms such as headaches, chest pain, stomach upsets, problems sleeping, or getting sick more often.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Think about how your body handles stress, and how you handle it emotionally, physically and in your relationships," Dr. Debar says. "What do you do, what do you not do."</p>



<p>Chronic stress can have long-term health effects. People who feel ongoing physical symptoms or find that <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-relievers/art-20047257?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lifestyle changes</a> do not seem to help should consult with their health care team, Dr. Debar says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> What happens during a spinal adjustment? Can professionals other than chiropractors safely do spinal adjustments?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong><span style="color: #202426">Chiropractors commonly perform spinal adjustments, also known as </span><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chiropractic-adjustment/about/pac-20393513?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><span style="color: #003da5;text-decoration: none">spinal manipulation</span></a><span style="color: #202426">. However, osteopathic doctors, physical therapists and medical doctors who are specially trained in manipulation may provide the service as well. The purposes of spinal manipulation are to alleviate pain and to optimize spinal motion in regions that are notably stiff or tight.</span><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Specific techniques may differ among practitioners. In general, during spinal manipulation, the practitioner applies a controlled amount of force to a spinal joint in the neck or back, either manually or using a device. Sometimes the force terminates in a quick, shallow thrust to the targeted joint. Alternatively, a rhythmic, nonthrust force also can be applied to improve joint motion in your spine and pelvis. The practitioner also may use a special table to help perform spinal adjustments more effectively. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Practitioners who perform spinal manipulation also may perform a massage-type technique called soft tissue mobilization, either immediately before or just following spinal manipulation. Like spinal manipulation, soft tissue mobilization also can be performed by specially trained chiropractors, osteopathic doctors, physical therapists and medical doctors. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Several types of soft tissue mobilization exist, but one of the more common approaches is called myofascial release. Like massage, this approach is typically performed on the skin. It combines slow, low-pressure glides over the affected muscles and connective tissues with higher-pressure holds as your body is slowly guided through specific movements. Like spinal manipulation, the purposes of soft tissue mobilization are to alleviate pain and to optimize movement, as well as to release tension in tight muscles affecting your spine. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Available evidence indicates that spinal manipulation can help with low </span><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/back-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050878?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><span style="color: #003da5;text-decoration: none">back pain</span></a><span style="color: #202426">, especially if the pain is recent and not due to compression of a nerve root. For some people with low back pain, spinal manipulation may be just as effective as conventional care, such as exercise and pain relief medications. There's also some evidence that spinal manipulation may help common </span><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/headache/basics/definition/sym-20050800?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><span style="color: #003da5;text-decoration: none">headaches </span></a><span style="color: #202426">and </span><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neck-pain/basics/definition/con-20028772?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><span style="color: #003da5;text-decoration: none">neck pain</span></a><span style="color: #202426">.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Spinal manipulation is generally considered to be safe when it's performed by a trained and licensed practitioner. Common side effects are soreness in the treated area, dizziness or tiredness. These problems typically clear up within one to two days. Serious side effects are rare but may include pinching of spinal nerves, resulting in leg pain and weakness, or worsening of a herniated disk. Thrust manipulation to the neck has rarely been associated with stroke.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">Spinal manipulation generally isn't recommended if you have severe </span><a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/basics/definition/con-20019924?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><span style="color: #003da5;text-decoration: none">osteoporosis</span></a><span style="color: #202426">, cancer in your spine, previous spinal surgery or inflammatory arthritis.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">In situations where spinal manipulation is considered unsafe, your healthcare professional may recommend alternative options, depending on the cause of your neck or back pain. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">These may include one or a combination of the following: specific home exercises and stretches for your spine, massage therapy, yoga, tai chi, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, oral medications, or spinal injections. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in;line-height: 150%"><span style="color: #202426">If you're considering spinal manipulation therapy, ask your healthcare professional for a referral. Importantly, let the practitioner doing the spinal manipulation know about any other conditions you may have and other treatments you may be receiving. <span style="color: #000000"><em>— <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/holmes-benjamin-ben-d-d-c-ph-d/bio-20530358?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721"><strong>Dr. Benjamin Holmes</strong></a>, and</em></span> </span><b><i> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/gay-ralph-e-m-d-d-c/bio-20053457?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Dr. Ralph Gay</a><strong><span style="color: #202426">, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</span></strong></i></b></p>
