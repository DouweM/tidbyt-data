<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — About 8 to 10 million Americans over age 40 have an overabundance of cloned white blood cells, or lymphocytes, that hamper their immune systems. Although many who have this condition — called monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) — do not experience any symptoms, a new study shows they may have an elevated risk for several health complications, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melanoma</a>, a form of skin cancer. The findings, by Mayo Clinic researchers, are published in a new <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.24.00332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.</p>



<p>People with MBL fall along a spectrum that spans from a low amount to a high amount of these dysfunctional lymphocytes. Previous research has shown that MBL is a precursor to a type of blood and bone marrow cancer known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a> (CLL). People with CLL also have a heightened risk of melanoma.</p>

<p>"Our study is the first to show that people with this pre-cancerous stage of MBL have a 92% elevated risk of developing melanoma. The risk of melanoma is similar to what we see among people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/slager-susan-l-ph-d/bio-00083823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Susan Slager, Ph.D.</a>, researcher with the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/3-sites-1-comprehensive-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> and senior author of the study.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that having MBL, even at low levels, can serve as a biological signal, or biomarker, for early detection of melanoma, which is increasing worldwide.</p>



<p>Dr. Slager and her research team have been studying the largest available cohort of individuals — more than 7,000 people screened for MBL through the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/mayo-clinic-biobank/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Biobank</a>. The researchers have now followed these individuals for about four years and are finding a collection of potentially related diagnoses among those who screened positive for MBL.</p>



<p>In addition to the increased risk of melanoma, the researchers found that people with MBL were also at <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35969843/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher risk of cancers originating in the lymphatic system</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-020-0799-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hospitalizations due to serious infections</a> including from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41408-022-00754-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a>.</p>



<p>"Previously, scientists would equate MBL as just a part of the aging process. What we're seeing, though, is there are clinical consequences to having MBL — contracting serious infections and melanoma are some of them," Dr. Slager says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Technological advances provide a closer look</h2>



<p>Advances in flow cytometry, a high-resolution technology that enables researchers to look at cells in the blood and identify their varied physical characteristics, has helped propel this research. Clinicians and researchers can now identify people with MBL, the precursor to CLL, more easily.</p>



<p>People with CLL have a very high number of these identical circulating lymphocytes: more than 5,000 lymphocytes per microliter. (A microliter is about 1/50th of a drop of blood.) That's compared to a person with MBL, who typically has 1-5 of these circulating lymphocytes per microliter of blood. Through more sensitive flow cytometry, scientists can identify people earlier when their levels are still low.</p>



<p>"The risk of melanoma seems to be the same no matter how many of these cloned lymphocytes are in the blood, suggesting that just having a clonal population of these lymphocytes — meaning, having MBL— increases your risk of getting melanoma," she says.</p>



<p>Patients with CLL are encouraged to get annual skin cancer screenings by a dermatologist and to protect their skin from sun exposure to prevent melanoma.</p>



<p>"Our findings suggest that people with the precursor MBL stage should also be more diligent about following the established guidelines for skin cancer prevention including, for example, use of sunscreen and protective clothing," Dr. Slager says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps</h2>



<p>One of the questions Dr. Slager's team plans to explore next is whether there is a genetic overlap between MBL, CLL and melanoma. One hypothesis is that inheriting a genetic variant that increases the risk of MBL and CLL may also increase the risk of melanoma.</p>



<p>Another area the researchers are investigating is whether MBL impacts the clinical outcome among people with melanoma, including if having both MBL and melanoma reduces one's overall survival or affects a person's response to therapy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic is leading the way with a new treatment for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stage-4-prostate-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20377972">advanced prostate cancer,</a> specifically for prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (PSMA-positive mCRPC).</p>



<p>This treatment involves a radiopharmaceutical known as Pluvicto. It acts like a smart missile, targeting and eliminating cancer cells.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic experts offer this therapy for patients whose prostate cancer has spread and is resistant to standard treatments such as hormonal treatments and chemotherapy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sartor-alton-o-m-d/bio-20548417">Dr. Oliver Sartor</a>, a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist focused on prostate cancer, says Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of treating patients with this novel therapy, offering new options and hope for patients with advanced prostate cancer. He explains what this means.</p>

<p>Prostate cancer that spreads beyond the prostate is known as stage 4 or metastatic prostate cancer. There's a variety of treatments – including hormonal treatments that can help control the disease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Therapy for advanced prostate cancer</h2>



<p>"Once the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hormone-therapy-for-prostate-cancer/about/pac-20384737">hormonal therapies</a> begin to fail, then we have a new term, and we call it castrate-resistant. Metastatic means spread, so it has spread and it's resistant to the hormones. That's metastatic castrate-resistant," says Dr. Sartor.</p>



<p>He says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/lutetium-177-shows-significant-rpfs-benefit-for-metastatic-prostate-cancer/mac-20561488">PSMA lutetium-177,</a> the chemical name for Pluvicto, may be an option for some patients.</p>



<p>"We have to do a scan to be able to determine eligibility because we only want to treat the people that have good PSMA uptake. PSMA stands for prostate-specific membrane antigen, and we have a PET scan that can look at that very specifically," Dr. Sartor explains.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/Quadra-Pet-Scan-2024-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Qudra PET scan, imaging" class="wp-image-392995" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/Quadra-Pet-Scan-2024-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/Quadra-Pet-Scan-2024-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/Quadra-Pet-Scan-2024-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/Quadra-Pet-Scan-2024-16-x-9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/Quadra-Pet-Scan-2024-16-x-9-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A patient will undergo a PET scan to help determine eligibilty for treatment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once eligibility is confirmed, this therapy can be considered.</p>



<p>"It's a radioactive element. It's given intravenously in a short infusion. The FDA-approved regimen is to give it once every six weeks for a maximum of six doses," says Dr. Sartor.</p>



<p>Patients with advanced prostate cancer need a personalized treatment plan. "Please remember that individualization of care is absolutely critical in this disease," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Sartor is hopeful that this treatment will be made available to patients with prostate cancer earlier in their treatment course.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>World Lymphoma Day is September 15</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — For many doctors and researchers, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/discovery-translation-labs/cancer-research/cancer-immunotherapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunotherapy</a> that uses someone’s own immune system to target and attack cancer cells is the next and best frontier of cancer treatment. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/gnc-20405215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a>, is one type of immunotherapy. Sometimes likened to a “smart drug” or “living drug,” CAR-T cell therapy relies on <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/healthy-aging/how-will-crispr-gene-editing-change-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetically modified immune cells</a> to recognize and destroy cancer cells. In this expert alert, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vile-richard-g-ph-d/bio-00027663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</a>, an immunologist and cancer researcher at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, explains how CAR-T cell therapy works, including the benefits, risks and realities of treatment.</p>



<p>Over the last decade, immunotherapy-focused research has expanded, and results point toward promising, less arduous cancer treatments. Some immune system-focused drugs, for example, have shrunk or eliminated tumors — even in people with advanced cancers.</p>

<p>“The holy grail of all cancer therapies throughout the years has been to develop a treatment that targets only cancerous cells and not normal or healthy cells,” Dr. Vile says. “One of the reasons <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> can be so toxic and unpleasant is that it is very rarely highly selective for the cancer cells, and as a result it can harm other cells. CAR-T cell therapy, in theory, only kills cancer cells, which makes the treatment much gentler on the body.”</p>



<p>The&nbsp;U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/gnc-20405547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> for several conditions, including different types of B-cell <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymphoma</a>, some forms of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leukemia</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myeloma</a>. Research is underway at Mayo Clinic to explore CAR-T’s potential to treat diseases beyond cancer.</p>



<p>Like all immunotherapy, CAR-T cell therapy <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/cancer/mayo-clinic-qa-podcast-immunotherapy-for-multiple-myeloma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harnesses the power of the immune system</a> — in this case, by using and modifying the body’s T cells. As an important part of the immune system, T cells are a type of white blood cell that helps defend the body from infection and are thought to fight cancer.</p>



<p>To prepare these cells for targeted cancer treatment, T cells are collected from the body — typically through blood work — and are genetically treated in a lab. During this process, the T cells are modified to produce special receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). These CARs change the T cells in two important ways. First, the T cells can “see” certain antigens, called markers, on cancer cells they were previously blind to. Second, the CARs activate the T cell’s ability to kill the cancer cells. In short, Dr. Vile says that CAR-T cell therapy offers the immune system a sort of honing ability on cancer cells that it otherwise wouldn’t have.</p>



<p>From there, millions of these modified T cells are infused back into the bloodstream. In some cases, other cancer treatments, such as low-dose chemotherapy, are used in tandem with CAR-T cell therapy. The process overall is complex and time intensive. The lab process alone can take several weeks to prepare the CAR-T cells, although people don’t need to be in the hospital during this process. It’s also possible that people receiving CAR-T therapy may experience a reaction when the CAR-T cells are reinfused back into the bloodstream. A reaction, if it occurs, may require treatment in a hospital.</p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy is not yet effective for all types of cancer. Dr. Vile says this type of therapy is most effective for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/centers-of-excellence/walmart/specialties/blood-cancers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood cancers</a>, called hematological cancers, where tumors tend to be diffuse in the blood.</p>



<p>“In people, CAR-T cell therapy has been extremely successful for blood cancers, likely because the T cells are circulating in the blood, just like the cancer cells are,” says Dr. Vile. “Challenges remain for treating solid tumors, which grow in a localized place, such as in an organ. These tumor sites have evolved to become extremely hostile to immune cells.”</p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy has been an effective treatment for some forms of cancer — particularly for hard-to-treat or recurrent cancers. In fact, one study found that 18% of people with relapsing, treatment-unresponsive <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a> (CLL) experienced <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/08/15/car-t-cell-therapy-restores-hope-for-leukemia-patient/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full remission after a single CAR-T cell therapy treatment</a>. Additionally, CAR-T cell therapy has the potential to keep cancer in remission for many years.</p>



<p>Like most cancer therapies, CAR-T cell therapy comes with side effects, Dr. Vile says. Side effects may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a severe immune system reaction that can lead to death.</li>



<li>Noticeable, but often temporary, neurological side effects such as confusion, seizures, and difficulty speaking or walking.</li>



<li>Temporary blood conditions like anemia and low platelet count.</li>



<li>An increased risk of infection, particularly after the first few weeks of treatment.</li>
</ul>



<p>Scientists are working to develop next-generation methods that will reduce side effects, lower or even eliminate cancer recurrence, and better target treatment-resistant B-cell cancers. Critically, researchers also are focusing on expanding the scope of cancer targets to include a wider number of blood cancers, as well as solid tumors.</p>



<p>“Immunotherapy has really advanced hugely in recent years,” says Dr. Vile. “I believe future CAR-T cell treatment will involve targeting more than a single antigen in cancer cells so that the cancers can’t escape the therapy. Another major advancement would be understanding how we can put CAR-T cells into people so that the cells persist and keep people in remission for long periods of time, potentially for someone’s entire lifetime.”</p>



<p>There may be uses for CAR-T cell therapy aside from cancer treatment. Mayo Clinic researchers are studying whether CAR-T cell therapy may improve treatments for autoimmune diseases as well as reduce the risks of organ rejection in those who receive organ transplants.</p>

<p>"PCOS is polycystic ovary syndrome, and it's a combination of an excess of androgens, or male circulating hormones, and also menstrual irregularity," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>For example, missing your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/menstrual-cycle/art-20047186">menstrual</a> flow for three months.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>"PCOS does increase the risk of endometrial cancer," Dr. Butler says.</p>

<p>That's because patients with PCOS may miss menstrual cycles.</p>



<p>"This, over time, can lead to thickening of the uterine lining and can predispose a woman to get endometrial cancer," she explains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risk factors</h2>



<p>Genetics, excess androgen and obesity are risk factors.</p>



<p>"Obesity leads to elevated circulating estrogen levels, which can cause confusion for the menstrual cycle, skipping of menstrual periods and, thus, thickening of the uterine lining," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>She says oral contraceptive pills are a principal treatment for PCOS. Combined&nbsp;oral contraceptive pills  also can reduce the risk of endometrial, ovarian and colon cancer.&nbsp;And the good news is that, with early diagnosis, endometrial cancer can be treated with surgery.</p>

<p>"We can have an opportunity to really cure women and limit them from needing additional radiation or chemotherapy if it's caught quickly and they have overall very good prognosis long term," says Dr. Butler.</p>



<p>Missed periods can be due to a number of issues, including menopause. Dr. Butler says talk with your healthcare team if you are concerned.</p>

<p>In order to determine the best treatment option, patients must undergo a comprehensive workup, which includes a speech pathologist a gastroenterologist, and ear, nose and throat specialist.</p>



<p>Jessica&nbsp;Gregor,&nbsp;CCC-SLP,&nbsp;BCS-S&nbsp;is a board-certified swallowing specialist in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Mayo Clinic in Arizona&nbsp;says:</p>



<p>"The best evaluation for really looking at the road map of the swallow is called video fluoroscopy. That's using X-ray and watching a live video of your swallow under X-ray. We look from lips to stomach. It's important for us as the team to have a very solid understanding of the swallowing impairment so that we can best intervene appropriately." </p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My husband noticed a dark mole on my back when we were swimming. Should I be worried about skin cancer? I do my best to apply sunscreen. What other preventive measures can I take?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>If you have a concerning spot on your skin, you should have it evaluated by your primary care team or dermatologist. There are three major kinds of skin cancer — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">squamous cell carcinoma</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basal cell carcinoma</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melanoma</a>. Melanoma is the most dangerous. The first sign of melanoma is a change in an existing mole or a new, unusual-looking growth on the skin. Characteristics of a mole that may indicate melanoma are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Asymmetrical shape. </li>



<li>Unusual border. </li>



<li>Changes in color and size.</li>



<li>New symptoms such as itchiness or bleeding.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are several different types of melanoma. The most common type is caused by sun exposure, so be sure to wear protective clothing and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-sunscreen-needs-for-any-complexion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunscreen</a> of at least 30 SPF year-round. Avoid intense sun during the middle of the day as well as tanning and tanning beds. People who <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sunburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20355922#:~:text=Avoid%20sun%20exposure%20between%2010,sun%20tanning%20and%20tanning%20beds." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunburn</a> easily are especially at risk.</p>



<p>There's a big misconception that the only place you should be looking for melanoma is in sun-exposed areas such as the arms, legs, back and face. That is certainly the case for the majority of melanoma, but a small number of melanomas can occur without sun exposure at all. These appear underneath the toenails, fingernails, feet, toes and palms.</p>



<p>In general, people with a personal history of melanoma, family history of melanoma and individuals over the age of 60 to 65 — particularly people with light-colored hair and light-eye color — are likely to benefit from an annual skin exam. For some, screening should take place more frequently. People without any of those risk factors may not need a screening exam on an annual basis, but it is important to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/vid-20555584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check your skin</a> regularly and contact your healthcare team with any changes to existing moles. Keep in mind that not all changes are caused by skin cancer.</p>



<p>During screening, the patient will undress and be covered in a robe to examine their skin entirely. We use a dermatoscope, a light magnifier that helps to look into the first layer of the skin surface. This gives us a good idea of whether a spot is concerning or not.</p>



<p>If a skin cancer is identified, the patient will often have either an excision or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mohs-surgery/about/pac-20385222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mohs surgery</a>. An excision has predefined safety edges (margins) to ensure the entire skin cancer is removed. During Mohs surgery, a very small amount of skin around the edge of the spot will be removed. The patient is checked under a microscope during the procedure to ensure it is all taken. This procedure allows for the smallest scar and smallest area to be removed while ensuring the entire area of concern is eliminated. Mohs surgery is often used on the face, scalp and neck. Nowadays, there are multiple skincare screening apps out there. These apps either help you track your moles over time to identify if they're changing or photograph an individual spot on your skin you're worried about. Apps that use artificial intelligence are still in their infancy. In the future, this technology will likely be beneficial to help us but for now, contact your healthcare team with concerns. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/costello-collin-m-m-d/bio-20537501?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collin Costello, M.D.</a><em>, Dermatology, Phoenix</em></p>

<p><em>Due to the weather, the event has been postponed to Monday, Aug. 19. The details below have been updated to reflect this change. </em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic is set to celebrate the next phase of construction of its new proton beam therapy facility with a topping-off ceremony, which will place the final steel beam on top of the Andersen Building. </p>



<p>The Andersen Building, located in downtown Rochester, was constructed to meet the increasing demand of patients seeking advanced cancer treatment. The building, expected to be open and treating patients in the second quarter of 2027, will have three levels above grade and two below ground and will allow for future vertical expansion.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Proton Beam Therapy Program</a> opened in 2015 within the Jacobson Building in Rochester and has since approached its appointment capacity. Today, approximately 1,250 patients receive proton beam therapy per year in the Jacobson Building, which is adjacent to the Andersen Building. Approximately 900 additional patients per year will be treated at the Andersen Building to meet the site’s estimated demand of 2,000 patients who will need proton beam therapy each year by 2032.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proton beam therapy uses pencil beam scanning to precisely deliver high doses of radiation to cancerous tissue while minimizing radiation of surrounding healthy tissue. This highly targeted therapy is ideal for people with tumors close to, or in, vital organs and for young people whose organs are still developing.</p>



<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> A topping-off celebration for Mayo Clinic staff in the Department of Radiation Oncology. Staff will have the opportunity to sign the beam before it is placed on top of the building.</p>



<p><strong>WHO:</strong> Interviews available with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mahajan-anita-m-d/bio-20537779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anita Mahajan, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist and particle therapy medical director.</p>



<p><strong>WHEN</strong>: Monday, Aug. 19.  </p>



<p><strong>WHERE: </strong>The Andersen Building lot, near the project trailer at the intersection of 1<sup>st</sup> Ave NW and West Center Street.</p>



<p><strong>RSVP</strong>: Kelley Luckstein by 3 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 16, at <a href="mailto:newsbureau@mayo.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newsbureau@mayo.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Bone marrow transplants are a common treatment for various blood disorders and many types of cancers. At Mayo Clinic, patients with autoimmune disorders, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304">Crohn's disease</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scleroderma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351952">scleroderma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269">multiple sclerosis</a>,&nbsp;also may be eligible for an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/autologous-stem-cell-transplant/pyc-20384859">autologous bone marrow transplant</a>&nbsp;(using cells from your own body) as a treatment option. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ayala-ernesto-m-d/bio-20433306">Dr. Ernesto Ayala</a>, a hematologist and oncologist at Mayo Clinic, explains the use of autologous bone marrow transplantation to help these patients who aren't responding well to standard care.</p>

<p>In an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/autologous-stem-cell-transplant/pyc-20384859">autologous bone marrow transplant</a>,&nbsp;a patient's own healthy stem cells are used to replace diseased or damaged bone marrow.</p>



<p>"It's an intense treatment that has to be done in the hospital — typically, patients who stay in the hospital for approximately three weeks," says Dr. Ayala.</p>



<p>He says this is the time the immune system regenerates.</p>



<p>"Within three to six months after the transplant, the immune system is expected to be back to normal," says Dr. Ayala.</p>



<p>Patients with autoimmune disorders can return to their lives — most remaining in remission — making this treatment a good option.</p>



<p>"Autologous transplantation is an alternative and effective alternative for patients with autoimmune disease that are failing the standard treatments," Dr. Ayala says.</p>

Health consequences can range from a higher risk of early death to long-term conditions that lower your quality of life.

<p>"Our primary care colleagues spend a lot of time with their patients dealing with their blood pressure, and their cholesterol and their arthritis, sleep apnea, and urinary incontinence and diabetes," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>She says it's important to step back to look at what these health issues have in common.</p>



<p>"What kind of unites all of those things? It's obesity," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is obesity?</h2>



<p>"There are many ways of defining obesity, but ultimately, it's a condition of excess adiposity – too many fat cells," explains Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>And carrying extra weight increases your risk of certain hormonal cancers such as breast and endometrial cancer.</p>



<p>"It is also a risk factor for certain GI cancers, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer&nbsp;—&nbsp;numerous cancers. And we don't always know why but the link between obesity and cancers is clear," Dr. Shah says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;As obesity rates increase, the reasons are not always clear-cut.</p>

<p>Dr. Shah encourages talking with your healthcare team about your options if you are concerned about your weight.</p>
