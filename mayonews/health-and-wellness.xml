<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-often-should-you-wash-your-hair/">Mayo Clinic Minute: How often should you wash your hair?</a></h2>



<p>To shampoo or not to shampoo? That might be your question each time you head into the shower. Everyone's hair texture and needs are different. However, there are some guidelines to consider when it comes time to wash your hair. ⁠Here's what you should consider.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-finds-active-workstations-may-improve-cognitive-performance/">Mayo Clinic study finds active workstations may improve cognitive performance</a></h2>



<p>Extended sedentary behavior, whether at work or home, increases a person's risk of preventable chronic diseases. A Mayo Clinic study suggests that active workstations incorporating a walking pad, bike, stepper and/or standing desk are successful strategies for reducing sedentary time and improving mental cognition at work without reducing job performance. ⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-advances-in-treating-kidney-cancer/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Advances in treating kidney cancer</a></h2>



<p>Kidney cancer is one the most common cancers in the U.S., with over 81,000 new diagnoses in 2023 alone. Dr. Aaron Potretzke, a Mayo Clinic urologist, explains how advances in diagnostics and treatment have made kidney cancer more treatable than ever before.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-essential-tips-to-ensure-safe-sleep-for-infants/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Essential tips to ensure safe sleep for infants</a></h2>



<p>The risk for sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, is highest in the first year of life. A recent study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics reveals that some mothers are aware of safe sleep guidelines for infants, but they regularly engage in nonrecommended practices with the goal of improving their own and their baby's sleep.⁠ Here are the current safe sleep recommendations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/britinys-team/">Britiny’s team</a></h2>



<p>Britiny Schultz was born with a congenital heart defect. In 2016, Britiny underwent a heart and double-lung transplant. Then, in the fall of 2022, she says she started having new troubles.⁠</p>



<p>A trip back to Mayo Clinic in early 2023 uncovered the problem — a serious lung infection called scedosporium. In March of 2023, Britiny underwent her second double-lung transplant. At a recent follow-up appointment, Britiny's doctor shared that the lungs were working fine, and the infection was gone.⁠</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> April 16 is National Healthcare Decisions Day</em></p>



<p>No one can predict the future, but putting together an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/living-wills/art-20046303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advance directive</a> can bring you peace of mind and a plan for your medical care during an emergency or end of life.</p>



<p><a href="http://https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/robinson-maisha-t-m-d/bio-20178228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Maisha Robinson</a>, chair of the Palliative Medicine Department at Mayo Clinic in Florida, advises people to have these conversations with family members and loved ones. </p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:02) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Script_MCM-Creating-an-advance-directive-for-your-future-well-being.pdf">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"An advance directive is (really) a document that allows you to write out what your preferences are," says Dr. Robinson. "It often will say, 'If you can't make decisions for yourself, who would you want to help you make medical decisions?'"</p>



<p>Though it may be difficult, Dr. Robinson says to have a conversation with loved ones before becoming critically ill. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/twowomen_16x9.png" alt="" class="wp-image-385538" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/twowomen_16x9.png 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/twowomen_16x9-300x169.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/twowomen_16x9-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>Advance care planning is for people at every stage of life.</p>



<p>"So this is not just for people who have a serious or advanced medical condition," says Dr. Robinson. "All of us, everyone over the age of 18, really should be thinking about this and talking about this and documenting this."</p>



<p>There are two main parts to an advance directive: writing a will and choosing a healthcare surrogate, which is a person who can make healthcare decisions for you if you are unable to.</p>



<p>Dr. Robinson has three important tips after preparing your directive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tell your healthcare surrogate you've chosen them.</li>



<li>Inform them where the document is.</li>



<li>Give the document to your healthcare team and/or hospital.</li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. Robinson says not enough people in the U.S. have advance directives and that African Americans are less likely to create them and receive information about them compared to white people.</p>



<p>"It's too often that family members are left in the situation where they have to make decisions on behalf of a loved one," says Dr. Robinson. "We often say this is one of the best gifts you can give your loved one by saying, 'These are my wishes, please honor them.'"</p>

<p>"Every color of the rainbow has a different wavelength of light," says Dr. Davis. "And we have found, through research and dermatology, that certain visible light colors, when they are concentrated and intensified, can have some benefit to the skin."</p>



<p>Dr. Davis says blue light therapy done in a medical setting works to help treat acne by causing an oxidative reaction on the skin.</p>



<p>"Red light can have some similar anti-oxidative or oxidative properties on the skin, which can be used sometimes to treat acne and also photoaging," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>But what about light therapy outside of a dermatologist office, such as red light masks and wands sold over the counter? Dr. Davis says, before you spend your money on these products, which may not be effective or safe, talk to your dermatologist.</p>



<p>"If you have interest in using an over-the-counter red or pink light, or a prescription blue light from a dermatologist's office, please talk to your local dermatologist about its potential uses for you and your skin and your health," says Dr. Davis.</p>

<p>In the shower, you may be rinsing off the day's stresses. But when it comes to washing your hair, how often should you lather up?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wash your hair and scalp</h2>



<p>"We oftentimes think about shampooing as being beneficial for the hair. But we forget that we also have to address the scalp as well," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>She says if you don't regularly shampoo your hair, it's difficult for your scalp to get cleaned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"And that can lead to the buildup of dead skin and oil residue on the scalp, which can lead to dermatitis or dandruff, and be quite uncomfortable and itchy," she says.</p>



<p>Everyone's hair texture and needs are different. However, there are some guidelines to consider when it comes time to wash your hair.</p>



<p>"For persons of color, the typical recommended shampooing regimen is once to twice a week, separated by a couple of days, so that there's not dryness if you shampoo day to day," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>"And for people who are not skin of color, we recommend shampooing every second or third day at a minimum. And some patients can shampoo up to daily. It just depends on whether their hair needs cleansing and/or their scalp needs cleansing."</p>



<p>For those with conditions like dandruff, a different approach to hair hygiene may be needed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seborrheic-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dand</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dandruff/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruff</a>&nbsp;is the most common form of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seborrheic-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seborrheic dermatitis</a>, appearing as flaky skin on the scalp without severe redness or irritation. It typically can be managed with regular use of a gentle or medicated shampoo to reduce oil and skin cell buildup.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers will jump four hurdles to apply <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</a> to solid tumors in thyroid cancer. This regenerative immunotherapy has shown promising results in blood cancers, and new research is focused on using this treatment on more types of malignancies.</p>



<p>"CAR-T cell therapy is unlike other therapeutics," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a hematologist and cancer researcher. "Other therapies may slow down cancer. CAR-T cell therapy has shown great promise in stopping B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. Some of <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/car-t-cell-therapy-restores-hope-for-leukemia-patient/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my patients</a> have gone into complete remission that has lasted for years after just one treatment."</p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy harnesses the power of the body's immune system to kill tumors. T cells are taken from a patient, then genetically modified and returned to the body to act as guardians against cancer.</p>



<p>In a team science approach, Dr. Kenderian and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/copland-john-a-iii-ph-d/bio-00028205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Copland III, Ph.D.</a>, are collaborating as principal investigators on research to develop CAR-T technology for solid tumors in thyroid cancer. However, to do so they must address four challenges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. There are no clear targets in solid tumors</strong></h2>



<p>CAR-T cells are engineered to target specific proteins and antigens that are on the surface of cancer cells. Antigens are substances that activate the body's immune system. CARs are genetically programmed to trigger an immune response and destroy cancer cells.</p>



<p>"However, there are few clear targets on solid tumors like we have in liquid tumors," says Dr. Kenderian. "For CAR-T cell therapy to be successful, the first thing that we need to do is identify a protein to target that is unique to cancer cells that is not also expressed on normal tissue."</p>



<p>The teams of Dr. Kenderian and Dr. Copland believe they have identified such a target in the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) which is uniquely found on thyroid cancer cells in the thyroid gland. They are engineering THSR targeting into CAR-T cell therapy for thyroid cancer. This is known as TSHR CAR-T.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. One treatment type doesn't fit all solid tumors</strong></h2>



<p>Solid cancers are comprised of many cell subsets. As a result, a tumor may have genetic mutations in some cells that aren't present in others. This is known as tumor heterogeneity, and it makes it difficult to treat these cancers with a single therapy.</p>



<p>"To overcome the tumor heterogeneity, we are using a strategy to combine TSHR CAR-T cell therapy with small molecules to block cancer cells from growing and metastasizing," says Dr. Copland. "We are studying whether loading CAR-T cells with this synthetic receptor in combination will trigger a cancer fighting response."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Solid tumors may be resistant to CAR-T cell therapy</strong></h2>



<p>Unlike blood cancers, solid tumors exist in a microenvironment that suppresses the immune system. In addition, dense clusters of malignant cells may create a barrier that blocks the CARs from bringing their cancer fighting mechanisms into cells.</p>



<p>"One strategy for overcoming this challenge is to target cells that are contributing to tumor aggressiveness," says Dr. Copland. "Another is to develop technology known as dual CARs that recognize two different targets. We are studying whether that will overcome tumor resistance."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Treating solid tumors may cause side effects</strong></h2>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy could mistakenly attack nearby healthy tissue, triggering what's known as "off-target effects." The result might be adverse side effects that are hard for the patient to tolerate. TSHR is a unique target that is expressed only on thyroid cancer cells and not on normal tissues, which minimizes the risk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On-site biomanufacturing is a bridge to clinical trials</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Kenderian and Dr. Copland are refining the TSHR CAR-T cell technology in the lab and in preclinical models. Biomanufacturing at Mayo Clinic will provide a bridge to accelerate this technology from the lab to early-stage clinical trials.</p>



<p>The process development team within Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> now is conducting test runs and establishing standard operating procedures in preparation for biomanufacturing this technology at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"On-site biomanufacturing is critical to preserving the integrity of the cells during manufacturing," says Dr. Kenderian. "This is a very complex technology with many components that would make it difficult, if not impossible, to ship to an outside manufacturer."</p>



<p>Dr. Kenderian and Dr. Copland are driven by a passion to provide new therapies for patients who have few or no therapeutic options. Their goal is to advance CAR-T cell therapy for thyroid cancer to a first-in-human clinical trial by early 2025<em>.</em></p>

<p>"Pink eye, or the medical term is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pink-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20376355?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conjunctivitis</a>, typically is a red or pink, irritated eye that can present with other symptoms, like tearing of the eye, itchiness, and sometimes pain and discharge," says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>Pink eye is an inflammation of the transparent membrane that lines the eye and eyelid. It's most often caused by a virus, but bacterial infections and allergies can sometimes be the culprit.</p>



<p>"How we treat conjunctivitis depends on what causes it," says Dr. Ardon. "Most commonly, we're still dealing with viruses. So those will resolve on their own without intervention. Sometimes we do consider treating that with an antibiotic drop if it is bacterial in nature."</p>



<p>She says, like common colds and the flu, pink eye is contagious and taking certain precautions is key.</p>



<p>"Most patients may be at risk for contracting this if they touch someone who has the pink eye, rubs their eye, maybe touches their face, doesn't wash their hands consistently," says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>Because pink eye is most often viral, antibiotics usually won't help. Treatment is focused on symptom relief.</p>



<p>"They may find themselves to be a bit more comfortable if they use items such as a warm compress to alleviate some of their symptoms. And rest, again, can be really helpful," says Dr. Ardon.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In this Q&amp;A, Dr. Binnicker offers more context on the current influenza outbreak.</strong></h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What is the risk of bird flu transmitting to humans?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>A</strong>: Currently, the CDC is characterizing the risk to humans of this avian influenza outbreak as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/inhumans.htm">low</a>. So, if we're on a scale of 1 to 10, we're probably at a 1 or a 2. Now, the concern is that we're seeing not only millions of infections in commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks that humans frequently come into contact with, but we're also seeing higher rates of infection in mammals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>Q: How is avian influenza transmitted?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>A</strong>: The birds will transmit avian influenza through their own respiratory mucosal secretions, much like we think about with other respiratory viruses in humans, or through contaminated feces. So a bird can become infected through exposure to contaminated soil or feces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For humans, the transmission so far has been very rare; there have only been two documented cases of avian influenza in the U.S. since 2022, one in Colorado and most recently in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0401-avian-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What are the symptoms of infection?</strong></h3>



<p>Those individuals were infected by coming into very close contact with animals who had avian influenza. These individuals may have come in contact with a respiratory secretion from an infected bird or mammal, or a contaminated surface. It is possible for humans to inhale the virus, or to become infected through self-inoculation if they touch a contaminated surface and then introduce the virus into their eyes, nose or mouth.</p>



<p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wild, migratory birds often do not show symptoms of avian influenza infection. Wild birds are a reservoir for avian influenza viruses. In commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks, that's where we see more severe disease. Since 2022, there have been over 60 million commercial poultry or backyard bird flocks killed or culled because of avian influenza infection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In humans, avian influenza can present in a similar way to normal human influenza infection. As is the case with other respiratory viral infections, avian influenza in humans may cause a spectrum of illness, from mild disease to a severe lower respiratory tract infection. In this most recent case in Texas, the patient only experienced <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/home-remedies-coping-with-conjunctivitis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conjunctivitis</a>, which is redness and inflammation in the eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Can bird flu be prevented?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>A</strong>: The key preventive measure is to avoid contact with a sick or dead animal, especially birds. If you own a backyard bird flock or work in a commercial poultry facility, and there are birds that are sick or have died, do not come in contact with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if it’s impossible to avoid contact, it's important to take necessary precautions, including wearing eye protection, an N95 mask and gloves. Those protective measures are going to help prevent an individual from coming into contact with avian influenza virus, either through inhalation of infected respiratory secretions or by self-inoculating the virus from a contaminated surface into the eyes, nose or mouth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What should the public keep in mind?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Currently, the overall risk of widespread infection in humans is low. We know that this virus is transmitted efficiently among wild birds, and since 2022, it has resulted in millions of infections in commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks. We've also started to see infection in many types of mammals, but so far, infection in humans is rare.&nbsp;We need to approach this with a sense of preparedness. Now is the time to put tools in place in the event we see sustained, high rates of transmission in humans. These tools include testing, antivirals and vaccines, which can be rapidly deployed and hopefully prevent avian influenza from becoming a worldwide proble</p>

<p>The typical <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/head-feels-heavy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">average adult head weighs</a> approximately 10-12 pounds. But did you know that bending it forward at a 45-degree angle to look at a cellphone or tablet can dramatically increase your chances to have "tech neck?" </p>



<p>"That's like having an 8-pound bowling ball as your head. Then you have 72 pounds at your elbow and 96 pounds on your shoulder," says Brian Langenhorst, industrial and ergonomics specialist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse</a>. "I probably see tech neck on a weekly basis at businesses, schools and industry."</p>



<p>Tech neck is any form of chronic neck or shoulder pain, soreness, or stiffness caused by poor posture while using technology such as phones or computers. Looking down at electronic devices causes the neck muscles to strain and the shoulders to slump forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"People will notice some musculoskeletal fatigue," explains Langenhorst. "They may notice pressure on nerve supply, which then can have some referred pain, and pressure on nerve supply within the neck that can have referred pain within the arms and hands."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over time, this position can deform your shoulder, chest and neck muscles and put pressure on your spine.</p>



<p>"You may have eight to 10 hours at work on a computer. Then you're home for two to four hours on a computer or on your phone. That's extremely fatiguing to your neck and body," says Langenhorst.</p>



<p>"With cellphones, we're having to bring them closer to maintain visual comfort," adds Langenhorst. "What I find all too often is many people don't move enough. They are staying in a static position for extremely long periods of time."</p>



<p>On average, people spend <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplodingtopics.com%2Fblog%2Fsmartphone-usage-stats%23top-smartphone-stats&amp;data=05%7C02%7CThiesse.Ricky%40mayo.edu%7Ceaca780f18444ab3caec08dc3d5b3b50%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638452709238912081%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=FMEfqdLTtYFW0XtXUePj3IWNJhsS5QxeLY5ftqfA2Iw%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three hours and 15 minutes </a>on their phones each day. Individuals check their phones an average of 58 times each day. Almost half (46%) of Americans believe they spend an average of four to five hours on their smartphones each day. <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Ftech%2Fmobile%2Fwell-spend-nearly-a-decade-of-our-lives-staring-at-our-phones-study-says%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CThiesse.Ricky%40mayo.edu%7Ceaca780f18444ab3caec08dc3d5b3b50%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638452709238916924%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2BN5Z53qGAb74gS7MiM8vDm3JF0iacSTcDZ96Hjnxi04%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A 2020 study</a> discovered that Americans will spend nearly nine years of their life using their phone.</p>



<p>"Static positioning is actually more work and more effort than dynamic movement," offers Langenhorst.&nbsp;"Your body is going to ask you do you want to have visual comfort or postural comfort. The key here is that vision always wins because we change our posture to accommodate vision."</p>



<p>Tech neck also can cause issues beyond your neck and shoulders. Extra spinal pressure in your neck can lead to lower back pain,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/headache/basics/definition/sym-20050800">headaches</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinichealthsystem.org%2Fspinecenterlacrosse%2F%3Fcustomer_id%3D750-851-3615%26mc_id%3Dgoogle%26campaign%3D19807845764%26geo%3D9019294%26kw%3Dherniated%2520disc%2520mayo%2520clinic%26ad%3D650977573423%26network%3Dg%26sitetarget%3D%26adgroup%3D148296490473%26extension%3D%26target%3Dkwd-336143140249%26matchtype%3Dp%26device%3Dc%26account%3D7508513615%26invsrc%3Dmchsswwi%26placementsite%3Dmchs%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAopuvBhBCEiwAm8jaMbhZAoa1frmxjvvUF7Op_T-VV0y5ShxPLDTb3euPRblZZb3x6c9FNBoCXlcQAvD_BwE&amp;data=05%7C02%7CThiesse.Ricky%40mayo.edu%7Ceaca780f18444ab3caec08dc3d5b3b50%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638452709238921665%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=OFiMcIxhTjBIB4BMTCo0v%2BEFj5CIL9DGDS45kDtBr%2Fo%3D&amp;reserved=0">herniated disks</a>&nbsp;(slipped or bulging disks).&nbsp;Altered neck muscles and poor posture also can strain jaw joints and muscles, creating temporomandibular joint pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Just think about kids and when they're home. They have their tablet, desktop or phone at home for homework. Just look at their posture and see what their posture looks like. Are they in a pretty good position? If they're not, they're probably in all sorts of kind of goofy postures," says Langenhorst. "They can probably get away with it while they're a little bit younger and invincible. But soon, even in their early 20s,&nbsp;&nbsp;muscle fatigue is going to kick in, and we're going to notice some more strain and sprain. Make sure they're doing some consistent stretching and movement that we build into our day."&nbsp;</p>



<p>One tip Langenhorst also recommends is placing pillows on your lap allowing your forearms to be supported on those pillows. He also suggests trying to hold the phone at more of an upright, angled position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's not great, but it's better than not being supported," Langenhorst shares. "As we age, the disks of our spine become narrowed, we start to lose some of the cushiness that's there. That can generate a little bit more pressure on the nerve roots that come out of the level of the neck. As you get older, meaning 45 and older, those disk spaces become narrower. That can put pressure on your nerves within your neck. Some people could notice a level of fatigue and discomfort, then generating into pain. Pain can then generate into disability."</p>

<ul>
<li>Place your screen 20-30 inches away from your eyes (about an arm's length). &nbsp;</li>



<li>Use a computer monitor or laptop stand to help elevate your screen to the right level (or stack some books).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Sit with your head, hips and spine stacked. "My eye height should be about 1/2 inch to 1½ inches higher than the screen because we have a 15-degree eye gaze. When I'm looking straight ahead, my neck muscles and my back muscles and my upper shoulder muscles get a chance to relax. This prevents putting uneven pressures on the nerve supply or the muscle groups," adds Langenhorst.</li>



<li>Keep your wrists straight and your elbows bent at about 90-degree angles.</li>



<li>Keep your knees in line with your hips and your feet flat on the floor.</li>
</ul>



<p>"The greatest challenge is we're not working or staying in a neutral or straight posture. I want to be able to have my head in an upright position, ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips," he says.</p>



<p>Neck pain is the fourth leading cause of disability, with an annual prevalence rate exceeding 30%. Most episodes of acute neck pain will resolve with or without treatment, but nearly 50% of people will continue to experience some degree of pain or frequent occurrences.</p>
