<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>I was diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. When is a knee replacement appropriate?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Osteoarthritis is an extremely common condition affecting over 500 million people worldwide. The knee is the most frequently affected joint. <a href="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/condition/kneearthritis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knee osteoarthritis</a> occurs when protective cartilage in the knee wears down leading to inflammation and pain. Commonly, patients will have bone spurs, and the normal shape of their knee is disrupted.</p>



<p>Symptoms of knee osteoarthritis may develop slowly, or in some patients it may come on relatively quickly. The most common symptoms include pain with weight-bearing activities, stiffness and decreased function.</p>



<p>Knee osteoarthritis has several causes, but the most common causes are genetic predisposition and activity level. Other risk factors include age, gender, obesity, prior surgery or prior trauma to the knee.</p>



<p>The diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis is made based on a combination of a thorough medical history, a detailed physical examination and imaging, which is most commonly performed with X-rays.</p>



<p>When diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis, several treatment options are available. In general, nonoperative treatment is recommended first. The most common nonoperative treatments are oral pain medications, activity modification, use of gait aids while walking, or injections.</p>



<p>For pain medications, we typically recommend non-opioid medications such as acetaminophen, or not steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen or naproxen. The goal of these medications is to reduce the inflammation and subsequent pain associated with osteoarthritis.</p>



<p>Similarly, activity modification and the use of a gait aid are aimed at reducing the load in the knee that, subsequently, can cause pain.</p>



<p>The most common injection for the knee is a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-benefits-and-risks-of-corticosteroid-shots/">steroid</a>. The goal is to reduce joint inflammation and improve symptoms. Some patients may get relief from these nonoperative treatments for months while others only get a good response for a few weeks.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/knee-pain/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knee replacement</a> is indicated when patients have tried several nonoperative treatments and they are no longer working. Knee replacement is most appropriate when the pain limits activities and quality of life. This may mean patients are no longer are doing activities that they love such as walking or exercising.</p>



<p>Many patients can live with their knee osteoarthritis without having surgery, as the nonoperative treatments are effective for them. Knee replacement is reserved for those who have both activity limitations and have failed nonoperative treatment.</p>



<p>During a knee replacement, the surgeon cuts away the damaged bone and cartilage from your thigh bone (femur), shin bone (tibia), and in some cases the kneecap (patella). These areas are then replaced with an artificial joint typically consisting of metal and high-grade medical plastic.</p>



<p>For a majority of patients, a knee replacement significantly improves pain and function and increases mobility. In some cases, however, complications do occur. This is why we recommend surgery only for patients who understand the risks and benefits of the procedure and are willing to undergo a surgery while understanding those risks to relieve their pain.</p>



<p>To help make the decision of whether a knee replacement is appropriate, a patient should see an orthopedic surgeon who can perform that careful history, physical examination and review the X-rays with the patient. The surgeon can then review the risks and benefits of the procedure and discuss through a shared decision-making process if surgery would be appropriate for the patient.</p>



<p>Although nonoperative treatments are effective for the majority of patients with knee osteoarthritis, they do not work for everyone. If you are interested in learning more about knee replacement, seek a full evaluation and consultation from an orthopedic surgeon who can review your condition and discuss what options might work best in your individual situation. â€” <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hannon-charles-p-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20551556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Hannon, M.D., M.B.A.</a>, Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (0:57) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post.&nbsp;Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."&nbsp;Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/10/Script-MCM-Weekend-Warrior-Exercising.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Exercise is key to a healthy lifestyle.</p>



<p>For those on a time crunch, stacking weekly exercise into a couple of days comes with the title "weekend warrior."</p>



<p>â€œThings like running, jogging, high-intensity workouts, ideally, the more that you can do, the better. People that did this, lowered mortality, lowered cardiovascular events," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>At least <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">150 minutes</a> of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous activity is recommended for adults each week.</p>



<p>"We don't expect people that have gone from a sedentary activity of not doing anything to jumping into 150 minutes a week. So taking days of break in between, assessing how your body responds to that activity," says Dr. Troyer.</p>



<p>Repeating the same motions or ramping up too quickly could lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/overuse-injury/art-20045875?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overuse injuries</a>, inflammation and pain.</p>



<p>â€œIf you take a couple days off and it's still persistent pain with daily activity â€” pain that keeps you up at night or keeps you from sleeping â€” these are all things that we typically recommend people coming in to be evaluated," he says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technology allows care team to remotely monitor patients' recovery</strong></h2>



<p>MANKATO, Minn. â€” For more than 15 years, Ronald Gary Woods ended most days with aching knees.</p>



<p>"It was hard walking around. My knees would get sore and were popping and cracking," says Woods, 63, of Eagle Lake, Minnesota. "It's like everything else, they just wore out."</p>



<p>Woods tried various treatments, including cortisone shots and nerve ablation, to interrupt pain signals sent to the brain. His plan was to wait until retirement for surgical intervention. "But I was tired of hurting," he says.</p>

<p>Woods and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jacob-ziegler-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Ziegler, M.D.</a>, his orthopedic surgeon at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato</a>, recommended bilateral knee replacement, a surgery to replace both of his knees at the same time. Dr. Ziegler had recently become the first surgeon in the health system to begin utilizing new sensor technology licensed by Zimmer Biomet through a partnership with Canary Medical. The smart orthopedic implants function just like standard knee replacements, but they include a sensor in the stem anchored in the shin bone that remotely monitors and tracks a patient's recovery by measuring range of motion, steps, stride and other data associated with gait.</p>



<p>Dr. Ziegler explained to Woods that he would have use of an app to see his gait and mobility information as he recovered from surgery. The data would be uploaded once daily to Dr. Ziegler's team, helping them monitor how well Woods was progressing.</p>



<p>"It sounded pretty good," Woods says. "The doctor said it was for research too. I thought, 'Why not?'"</p>



<p>According to Zimmer Biomet, Woods was one of the first known patients in the world to receive single-surgery bilateral smart knee replacements on March 26.</p>



<p>Dr. Ziegler and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/couch-cory-g-m-d/bio-20493331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Couch, M.D.</a>, orthopedic surgeon at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/orthopedic-surgery/home/orc-20126749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>, Minnesota, are the only two Mayo Clinic surgeons who have implanted smart knee replacements in patients, but they will become widely available after Mayo Clinic's trial period of the technology.</p>



<p>Remote monitoring is a major benefit in the rural healthcare setting, Dr. Ziegler says. Patients who live a longer distance from the hospital may not have to return for some in-person follow-up appointments during recovery if the smart knee data shows positive recovery metrics.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="837" height="711" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/Patient-Xray-Ronald-Gary-Woods-Bilateral-PIQ-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-392502" style="width:514px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/Patient-Xray-Ronald-Gary-Woods-Bilateral-PIQ-1.jpg 837w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/Patient-Xray-Ronald-Gary-Woods-Bilateral-PIQ-1-300x255.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/Patient-Xray-Ronald-Gary-Woods-Bilateral-PIQ-1-768x652.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px" /></figure></div>


<p>"The biggest benefit to patients is our ability to monitor their progress with objective data," Dr. Ziegler says. "Historically, we had to do it very, very subjectively. We could see their range of motion, and beyond that, it was just asking, 'How do you feel? Do you feel like you're moving well? Do you feel like you're progressing?' And patients didn't have any way of knowing what normal should be or what to compare it to. We're able to pull up these recovery curves and show them how their data compares to other patients in a cohort and what they can do to progress."</p>



<p>The battery is guaranteed to last 10 years, although many will likely last longer, Dr. Ziegler says. When the battery dies, the knee replacement continues to function like a traditional knee replacement.</p>



<p>Dr. Ziegler is quick to point out that patient privacy is always at the forefront. Real-time data is not collected, and there is no GPS component showing the care team where the patient is located at any time. Patients also can choose to stop uploading data if they no longer want their metrics shared with the care team.</p>



<p>The only criteria for patients who want to receive a smart knee is that they must be comfortable enough with the technology to be able to engage with the app, Dr. Ziegler says.</p>

<p>The future of the technology is exciting to think about, he says. Future versions could have potential to detect micro motions and subtle temperature changes to identify infection early on or loosening of the implant.</p>



<p>Both Dr. Ziegler and Woods agree he's doing very well in his recovery, and the data from the smart knee has helped his care team ensure he's been on the right trajectory.</p>



<p>"It's getting better every day," says Woods, who just several months after surgery was able to get back on his motorcycle. "I won't make it to Sturgis this year, but next year for sure."</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="660" height="370" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/people-playing-basketball-16x9-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-392358" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/people-playing-basketball-16x9-1.jpg 660w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/08/people-playing-basketball-16x9-1-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>In the early 1990s, ankle braces began appearing more often on sports courts and playing fields due to their improved designs. They also cost less than repeatedly taping an athlete's ankle.</p>



<p>Now, ankle braces are available in various designs, including sport-specific options. But the goal is the same â€” to provide extra support after an injury or prevent an ankle sprain from occurring in the first place.</p>



<p>Coaches, parents and athletes often ask if wearing an ankle brace is worthwhile. Research shows that high school-age athletes who use ankle braces experience fewer ankle injuries. However, ankle braces don't reduce the severity of ankle, knee or other lower-extremity injuries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How bracing works</h2>



<p>Bones, muscles and a network of ligaments and tendons form internal supports that keep your ankle stable, flexible and strong. Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that stabilize joints and help prevent excessive movement.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Three main bones make up the ankle joint:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Tibia</strong>&nbsp;â€” the long shin bone in your lower leg that provides the main weight-bearing surface at the roof of the ankle joint</li>



<li><strong>Fibula</strong>&nbsp;â€” the bone on the outside of the ankle that provides lateral and rotational stability</li>



<li><strong>Talus</strong>&nbsp;â€” the bone that provides the lower cartilage in the ankle and connects the ankle to the foot, functioning like a hinge to flex your foot</li>
</ul>



<p>These internal supports link your foot all the way up to your hip. Ideally, they function as a unit.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/-/media/national-files/images/hometown-health/2024/ankle-anatomy-illustration.jpg?h=221&amp;w=351&amp;sc_lang=en&amp;hash=B2BBB5544EF5A5629A43DE97F4CF7B81" alt="Ankle anatomy illustration"></p>



<p>Ankle braces serve as external supports to limit certain motions, such as plantar flexion/inversion, which is the movement at the ankle joint that points the foot downward away from the leg and turns the foot inward.</p>



<p>Braces also provide awareness of where your ankle joint is in space. For maximum effectiveness, ankle braces should fit comfortably in the shoes you wear during an activity, which also makes it more likely you'll wear the braces.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rehabilitation plays a key role in recovery</h2>



<p>If you do experience an ankle injury, weakness or instability, rehabilitation is a key component of your treatment plan. Often, when athletes still have ankle pain or aren't back to full function, it's because they haven't allowed enough time to heal properly. Rehabilitation providers specialize in balance, range of motion, strength and endurance, which are key therapy and training factors for recovery.</p>



<p>Performing exercises as directed helps ensure a safe return to activity and lessens the likelihood of reinjury.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deciding if a brace is right for you</h2>



<p>Keep in mind that wearing an ankle brace isn't a 100% cure-all or guarantee against injuries. Your healthcare team can help you make an educated decision about whether an ankle brace is right for you.</p>

<p>Starting a workout program or being physically active takes motivation and commitment. The key is to start slowly and do something you take pleasure in.</p>



<p>"If you hate swimming, don't try to start to become a swimmer. But (if) you enjoy dancing or other activities (such as) gardening, those are forms of activity that once you engage in, you increase your consistency and compliance that will have the most health benefits," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>

<p>Being active can build muscle strength and improve cognitive and cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>"Three percent, or 30 minutes a day, of our waking hours, if we commit that to physical activity, will have huge benefits," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>And for those young at heart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.</p>



<p>"As we get older, dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tips to get started and stick with a workout plan:</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Research workout routines.</li>



<li>Schedule your workouts.</li>



<li>Find an exercise buddy.</li>



<li>Be consistent.</li>

Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/07/SCRIPT-jthEDITS_Wrist-pain-thumb-pain-sk-version-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Does your thumb hurt when you're scrolling on your phone? Is it made worse when gripping objects? You could be suffering from basilar thumb joint arthritis.</p>



<p>"Patients will typically complain, for example, in opening a jar, turning a key, opening a doorknob will cause pain," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-thumb-arthritis-original.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of thumb arthritis" class="wp-image-213373" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-thumb-arthritis-original.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-thumb-arthritis-original-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<p>In a normal thumb joint, bones are covered in cartilage, but with arthritis, the cartilage wears away, causing joint damage and pain.</p>



<p>"Which is basically pain as the thumb bone is grinding down every time you pinch a pound of pressure between the thumb and the index finger is magnified twelvefold," explains Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>Several <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thumb-arthritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378344">treatment options</a> are available to relieve aching joints, including medication, splints and, in some cases, surgery.</p>



<p>"We can do minimally invasive surgeries, for example, putting a camera in and cleaning it out. Or some of these nerves that give nerve endings to the bone, we actually get rid of those nerve endings to decrease the pain," says Dr. Kakar.</p>



<p>In more advanced arthritis, surgeons either remove the arthritic bone or perform a joint replacement. If symptoms persist, see a certified hand therapist.</p>

<p>AUSTIN, Minn. â€• For teens who love playing summer team sports, an injury that takes them out of the game can be devastating. Shoulder injuries are among the most common for athletes who play volleyball, tennis, swimming, football and a variety of others.</p>



<p>"The shoulder is an incredibly mobile joint that allows you to reach and rotate in a number of directions," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/robert-cates-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Cates, D.O.,</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/austin/services-and-treatments/orthopedic-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orthopedic Surgery and Sports Medicine</a>, Mayo Clinic Health System. "The design of the shoulder, like a golf ball on a tee, unfortunately makes it easy to slip out of place with enough force. That's why injuries are so common with contact sports."</p>



<p>People in their teens and 20s, because they tend to be more physically active, are at highest risk for shoulder dislocation. Also, people with looser joints can be prone to dislocation from smaller amounts of force.</p>



<p>However, if a shoulder becomes dislocated, it needs to be treated immediately. A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dislocated-shoulder/symptoms-causes/syc-20371715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dislocated shoulder</a> is easy to detect due to a look of deformity, lack of movement and intense pain.</p>



<p>Between the time of injury and medical treatment, don't move the joint or try to put it back in place. Use a sling or splint to hold it in its current position. Ice the joint to reduce pain and swelling.</p>



<p>"Treatment will include putting the joint back into the correct position. If the joint has been badly damaged, surgery might be required," says Dr. Cates. "Icing and anti-inflammatory medications will relieve pain and swelling. Physical therapy will be prescribed to help you regain range of motion and strength or prepare the shoulder for surgery."</p>



<p>If surgery is required, treatment can be arthroscopic, which involves making small incisions to allow the surgeon to repair the damage, or open (larger incision) if the damage is more severe. Recovery time will depend on the extent of the injury. For most people, a shoulder joint improves over a few weeks.</p>



<p>"If surgery was part of treatment, full recovery may take five or six months," says Dr. Cates. "We know how badly teens want to avoid missing out on the fun of playing sports, but the greatest risk during healing for any shoulder injury is returning to activities before the shoulder is stable."</p>



<p>The best way to prevent a shoulder dislocation is to concentrate on good mechanics and strength conditioning. However, competitive and casual athletes can experience this injury despite the best preparation because so many are caused by contact or falls.</p>

<p><em><strong>World Brain Day is July 22</strong></em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. â€” Fifteen million people worldwide have a <a href="https://www.emro.who.int/health-topics/stroke-cerebrovascular-accident/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a> each year. Of these, 5 million are left permanently disabled. An estimated 69 million people globally suffer <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29701556/#:~:text=Sixty-nine%20million%20%2895%25%20CI%2064-74%20million%29%20individuals%20worldwide,are%20estimated%20to%20sustain%20a%20TBI%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traumatic brain injuries</a> each year. <a href="https://www.cerebralpalsyguidance.com/cerebral-palsy/types/spastic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spastic cerebral palsy</a>, the most common form of cerebral palsy, accounts for 70% to 80% of all people diagnosed.</p>



<p>Patients living with physical changes from stroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy and other conditions may regain some function in their hands and arms â€” therefore improving their quality of life â€” thanks to advances in surgical options for upper motor neuron syndrome, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rhee-peter-c-d-o-m-s/bio-20346533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter C. Rhee, D.O.</a>, an orthopedic hand surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/upper-limb-reconstruction-umn-syndrome-clinic/overview/ovc-20466590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Upper motor neuron syndrome</a> refers to a dysfunction or deformity in the shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic or hypoxic brain injury, cerebral palsy, or spinal cord injury. People with this condition may have muscle weakness, decreased muscle control, altered muscle tone and spasticity.</p>



<p>Depending on the extent of the patient's disability, surgeons can perform a combination of joint fusions, tendon lengthenings, and tendon and nerve transfers. People with complete paralysis in their arms can still benefit from surgery by improving the position of their hands, wrist and elbows for hygiene or to enable basic functions that they have lost, Dr. Rhee says.</p>



<p>"The surgery aims to correct the deformity by treating individual muscles based on the underlying problems," says Dr. Rhee, who has been performing this surgery for the last 10 years. "We work on the nerves, muscles and joints. It's different for each patient, but the overall goal is to improve hygiene, improve function and improve quality of life."</p>



<p>Since patients may recover some function in the months after having a stroke, surgeons wait to perform the procedure until 12 to 18 months later. Initially, Dr. Rhee does a virtual visit to determine if the patient is a potential candidate for the surgery. If so, the patient comes in for specialized nerve tests and a formal in-person evaluation to fully determine if they would benefit from surgery.</p>



<p>"Regular exams give the surgeon a lot of information. The joint can be in a certain position because of spasticity or contraction," Dr. Rhee says. "Combining that with the nerve tests provides a comprehensive snapshot of what the muscles and nerves are doing to create the dysfunction and/or deformity."</p>



<p>Dr. Rhee uses the patient's test results to develop a tailored surgical plan.</p>



<p>When a person's entire arm is involved, Dr. Rhee will perform two surgeries, both on an outpatient basis, with a three-month wait between procedures. The first stage typically covers the shoulder, elbow and forearm; the second covers the wrist, fingers and thumb. Between surgeries, patients do stretching exercises at home as part of their treatment plan. The total process takes about six months.</p>



<p>"We have built an amazing team to give hope to patients who have had strokes, spinal cord or brain injuries, or adults with cerebral palsy," Dr. Rhee says.</p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. â€• The summer weather inspires people of all ages to head outside and play sports. For seniors, pickleball has become a popular option, partly because the court is small enough that players don't need to move very far to hit the ball.</p>



<p>But even with a sport that's easier on a person's joints, many people still suffer unnecessarily playing on aching hips and knees that need replacement.</p>



<p>"Fear is often part of the reason someone postpones surgery. They may have heard stories about hip and knee replacements from many years ago when recovery was painful and grueling," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jacob-ziegler-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Ziegler, M.D., Orthopedics &amp; Orthopedic Surgery</a>, Mayo Clinic Health System. "That's far from the case now. These are still major surgeries, but new techniques and technologies have greatly improved patients' experiences and outcomes."</p>



<p>Among those technologies is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/robotic-orthopedic-surgery/overview/ovc-20472153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robotic-assisted joint replacement</a>, which has revolutionized hip and knee surgeries. This technology allows the surgeon to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Perform enhanced, 3D preoperative planning and modeling to ensure there's no impingement or pinching of nerves or tissues and to refine implant sizing and positioning for a high degree of accuracy.</li>



<li>Prepare the bone and insert the implants with an unprecedented level of precision.</li>



<li>Produce outcomes for patients that are more predictable and able to be reproduced in other patients.</li>
</ul>



<p>A new service Dr. Ziegler is offering is smart knee replacement. A chip in the knee replacement uploads information about gait and mobility to alert care teams on the patient's recovery.</p>



<p>"This service is particularly helpful to patients who live far from the hospital and don't have close access to follow-up care," says Dr. Ziegler. "We can intervene early if we receive data that any adjustments are needed. And if everything looks good, the patient then has the option to follow-up by phone or by virtual appointment."</p>



<p>Another rapidly advancing technology in orthopedic surgery is 3D printing, which allows the designing and creation of custom implants to address challenging problems, including deformities, bone loss and unusual hip or knee anatomy. This promising technology needs more long-term data before it becomes widely used. Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of 3D printing and has been integral in advancing its clinical applications.</p>



<p>If a total hip or knee replacement is in your future, here's what you can expect:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hip replacements</strong></h2>



<p>Any patient who is a candidate for a conventional total hip replacement is a candidate for a robotic-assisted total hip replacement.</p>



<p>Hip replacements no longer are a one-technique-fits-all approach. With a 360-degree approach, your surgeon can tailor the surgery to you, choosing from direct anterior, posterior or anterolateral approaches. The surgeon will discuss these options and the entire surgical experience in detail with you during your pre-op consultation.</p>



<p>For most patients, total hip replacement surgery is either a same-day surgery or a one-night hospital stay.</p>



<p>Patients can walk and navigate stairs right after surgery.</p>



<p>The majority of patients will follow a self-directed physical therapy plan at home, with no need to go to an outpatient physical therapy facility.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Knee replacements</strong></h2>



<p>As with hip replacements, any patient who is a candidate for a conventional total knee replacement is a candidate for robotic-assisted total knee replacement. You'll also take part in a comprehensive education experience and physical therapy assessment to review the technique your surgeon will use during surgery.</p>



<p>Like hip replacements, total knee replacements typically are same-day surgeries or may involve a one-night hospital stay.</p>



<p>Once you've awakened from the anesthesia, you can walk and navigate stairs. About one week after surgery, you'll begin meeting with a physical therapist who specializes in working with knee-replacement patients. For best results with strength and range of motion, you'll also be assigned daily exercises to do at home to supplement your physical therapy sessions at an outpatient facility.</p>



<p>"The great news is that for both total hip and knee replacements, the technology continues to evolve with the primary goals of reducing pain and enhancing function," says Dr. Ziegler. "We want to get you back on the pickleball court, or enjoying any other sport of choice, as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>EAU CLAIRE, Wis. â€• When the weather has you enthused about fitness, the last thing you want is to be sidelined with joint pain.</p>



<p>"People might associate joint aches and pains with an older age group, but joint pain can affect people in all stages of life," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/amy-rantala-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Rantala, M.D.,</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/sports-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sports Medicine</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a>. "This can be frustrating because pain can be a barrier to maintaining regular exercise and enjoying being active in sports or other activities."</p>



<p>Preventing joint pain in the first place is the best course. A good first step if you want to join a sport or up your exercise goals is to check with your primary care provider or see a sports medicine specialist who can assess your overall fitness level, general mobility and if you have current injuries or pain.</p>



<p>They also may conduct a functional movement screening to evaluate how you move and pinpoint specific issues. For example, you may have decreased range of motion in a hip or shoulder or are stronger on one side than the other. This screening can identify specific rehabilitative exercises that can be done along with your regular exercise program. These exercises help your body move safely, perform exercises correctly, and reduce the risk for injury.</p>



<p>"When you do build an exercise program, make sure it's sustainable and incorporates cardio, strength building and flexibility," says Dr. Rantala. "Then ease your way into it. Don't go from 0 to 100 overnight because that can lead to injuries and sore joints."</p>



<p><strong>Some additional points to keep in mind:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Listen to your body. Don't overdo it. Take a break or tone down your activity for the rest of the day.</li>



<li>Keep a small problem small. If you're feeling recurring pain, get it checked out.</li>



<li>Build in time to recover between activity sessions. Our bodies need this time to rebuild and repair.</li>



<li>Work around your limitations. For example, if you have knee pain, using a reverse lunge or hex-bar squat helps reduces stress on your knees and allows you to target the same muscle groups.</li>
</ul>



<p>"If joint pain begins to restrict the activities you love, the best thing to do is consult an orthopedic or sports medicine specialist so the two of you can map out a plan for diagnosis and treatment to keep you active and enjoying your life," says Dr. Rantala. "Focus on playing the long game when it comes to sports and regular exercise by finding what works for your body long-term."</p>
