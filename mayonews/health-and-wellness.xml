<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> is taking steps to bolster the medical marvel of transplantation while addressing the confounding problem of a critical shortage of donor organs. It created the <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/about/news/news-archive/faculty-feature-transforming-transplant-and-joining-forces-to-accelerate-discovery-to-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transforming Transplant Initiative</a> with a bold goal of providing organ transplants for everyone who needs one. Another objective is to eliminate the waitlist that has grown to more than 100,000 people in the U.S.</p>



<p>"My vision is to not just help one patient, but help the thousands who have end-stage organ failure get lifesaving transplants," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-00027293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C. Burcin Taner, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic surgeon who leads the initiative. Dr. Taner is also the chair of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Transplantation</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing shortcomings of organ transplant</strong>s</h2>



<p>The Transforming Transplant Initiative was created as a collaboration between the Department of Transplantation and Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>. The project seeks to overcome the shortcomings of transplantation, the greatest of which is the need for more organs. Researchers working to improve transplantation ask tough questions like, "Could we bioengineer organs to reduce or eliminate the wait list?"Â  To answer that question, Mayo Clinic has formed a collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, pairing medical expertise with engineering know-how to make experimental organs.</p>



<p>"Bioengineering new organs is promising, but complex. We're looking at a research timeline of 10-15 years to potentially bring this new option to patients," says Dr. Taner.</p>



<p>This bioengineering research brings together 3D bioprinting, tissue engineering, biomaterials and cellular materials to grow humanlike organs.</p>



<p>The research is focusing on nine different bioengineering projects ranging from better ways of monitoring the health of transplanted organs to engineering complex organs such as hearts, lungs, livers and kidneys.</p>



<p>The Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics is supporting the project with biomanufacturing, stem cell technology and other resources.</p>



<p>"Regenerative biotherapeutics seeks to repair or replace diseased organs. As such, we are very excited to be part of the Initiative for improving transplantation," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qu-wenchun-m-d-ph-d/bio-20206516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wenchun Qu, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, the Jorge and Leslie Bacardi Associate Director, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics in Florida. "We hope to assist in the build out of this project by providing researchers, workspace, biomanufacturing capabilities and cell and gene technologies."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Making organ transplants more successful</strong></h2>



<p>Another challenge the Transforming Transplant Initiative is trying to address is graft failure or rejection of transplanted organs. Mayo Clinic's vision is to prevent the need for a second transplant. One research project is focusing on whether chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a>) could be used to control the body's immune response and prevent organ rejection. CAR-T therapy has mainly been used to treat blood cancers. Applying this technology to transplants would be a new, experimental use of CAR-T therapy.</p>



<p>"Some organ transplant patients have antibodies in their bloodstreams that increase their chances of (organ) rejection. Unfortunately, that makes it difficult to find a proper match," says Dr. Taner. "We hope research will show whether CAR-T cell therapy could harness the immune system to suppress antibodies that are causing rejection." Other Mayo Clinic goals include reducing the number of organs that are discarded and making more organs available through advanced preservation techniques. Another goal is to identify and treat disease early to prevent end-stage organ failure and the subsequent need for a transplant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Working together to improve transplant options</strong></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic leaders recognize that overcoming the complex barriers to organ transplantation will require powerful new collaborations. They are actively seeking new ways to work with experts in industry and academia that could bring new ideas, tools, specialized knowledge and energy to the field.</p>



<p>"Organ transplantation is one of the greatest accomplishments in modern medicine. There is also a lot of good expertise outside our organization," says Dr. Taner. "We welcome outside collaborators that could help us improve organ transplantation for patients."</p>



<p>It could take many years to realize the fruits of the Transforming Transplant Initiative. Nevertheless, Mayo Clinic researchers continue to work tirelessly to address the critical shortage of organs and bring the gift of organ donation to more people.</p>

<p>Vitamin K is a nutrient that helps blood clot or stop bleeding. Most adults get vitamin K from their food. Bacteria in the large intestines also make some vitamin K that the body can absorb.</p>



<p>Healthcare professionals recommend all babies receive a vitamin K injection at birth to help their blood clot effectively. New parents often have questions about these preventive measures for newborns, which also may includeÂ <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/carrier-screening-for-family-planning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenings for genetic conditions</a>Â and antibiotic eye ointment to prevent eye infections.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Here are answers to common questions new parents ask regarding vitamin K:</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How is vitamin K administered to infants?</h3>



<p>Since 1961, theÂ <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/common-questions-about-vitamin-k#AAP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>Â has recommended a singleÂ <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/birthing-centers/labor-and-delivery/immediately-after-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dose of vitamin K injected</a>Â into the thigh muscle of a newborn infant to prevent bleeding. The recommended dose is based on the infant's weight and given within six hours of birth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why does my baby need vitamin K at birth?</h3>



<p>A newborn typically has a low level of vitamin K in their blood at birth. Even if the pregnant person has a diet sufficient for vitamin K, only a minimal amount is transferred across the placenta before birth and is not enough to protect the baby after birth.</p>



<p>Although breast milk is the best nutrition for all infants, it has a relatively low level of vitamin K. While formula has more vitamin K per fluid ounce than breast milk, a baby is still at risk for a vitamin K deficiency without an injection after birth.</p>



<p>According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, recent evidence also shows that a postpartum person taking high doses of vitamin K while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/breastfeeding-101-tips-for-new-moms">breastfeeding</a>&nbsp;doesn't increase the level passed to the baby enough to prevent the risk of vitamin K-deficient bleeding.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is vitamin K safe for infants?</h3>



<p>There is no evidence that vitamin K injection causes any harm to the baby<em>.</em>&nbsp;Parents can minimize the short-term discomfort from the injection by holding or feeding the infant while it's administered.</p>



<p>Vitamin K is not a vaccine, doesn't contain mercury and has been proven to be safe and beneficial for over 60 years.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How quickly after birth does vitamin K deficiency develop?</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Vitamin K deficiency occurs in male and female infants and can develop during these time frames after birth:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Early onset</strong>&nbsp;â occurs on the first day of life</li>



<li><strong>Classic onset</strong>&nbsp;â occurs between day two and the first week of life</li>



<li><strong>Late onset</strong>&nbsp;â occurs between eight days and six months</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is vitamin K-deficient bleeding?</h3>



<p>Vitamin K-deficient bleeding can happen when a baby does not have enough vitamin K. Healthcare professionals have known about the condition, also known as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, for many decades. New parents may be unaware of vitamin K-deficient bleeding because it's become less common now that most infants receive the injection.</p>



<p>There is a risk of bleeding in the body up to 6 months of age in infants who don't receive a vitamin K injection at birth. These babies are 80 times more likely to experience severe bleeding.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What are the signs or symptoms of vitamin K-deficient bleeding in babies?</h3>



<p>Infants who don't receive a vitamin K injection at birth may have no warning signs of bleeding for days, weeks or months. Symptoms include bruising easily, paler than usual skin or blood in the stool. Vitamin K-deficient bleeding can occur in various parts of the infant's body, such as the skin,Â <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/delayed-umbilical-cord-clamping-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">umbilical cord</a>, nose, mouth, gastrointestinal tract and brain. Bleeding in the brain can be life-threatening and cause brain damage or death.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Can my baby receive vitamin K orally instead of as an injection?</h3>



<p>Oral vitamin K supplementation isn't recommended because it's less effective and requires multiple doses over several months to achieve the same benefit as the one-time shot. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved an oral vitamin K for newborns.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why is vitamin K essential for male newborns?</h3>



<p>Before the recommendation of vitamin K injection at birth in the U.S., infant males had an increased risk of bleeding during circumcision. At that time, one out of every nine baby boys who had an elective newborn male circumcision without vitamin K had bleeding that wouldn't stop.</p>



<p>The risk of bleeding during circumcision has significantly decreased since vitamin K supplementation became the standard of care in the U.S. For parents who choose an elective newborn circumcision, administration of vitamin K is required before the procedure.</p>



<p>Having your newborn receive vitamin K at birth reduces the risk of severe bleeding. Talk with your baby's healthcare team if you have questions about vitamin K.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease kills more Americans than any other condition.

<p>There are several contributing factors, including genetics, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-why-southern-food-is-linked-to-high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension,</a> obesity and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Type 2 diabetes</a>.&nbsp;Diet can play a key role in the development of heart disease and its risk factors. This is particularly true for Black people in the U.S., for whom traditional dishes, often referred to as "soul food," were often developed from unhealthy ingredients â by necessity.</p>



<p>During slavery, enslaved people were given leftovers and undesirable portions of meat. Over time, these foods have evolved and have become a part of African American cuisine, according to <a href="https://www.blackfoodie.co/the-humble-history-of-soul-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Foodie</a>. But some Southern foods can put you at risk for heart disease, depending on how often you eat them and how the dishes are prepared.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some soul foods can put you at risk for heart disease</h3>



<p>But soul food is sometimes loaded with sodium, sugar and fat, which makes those foods high in flavor but can also raise your risk of heart disease. Dr. LaPrincess Brewer suggests that people make subtle changes to their diet.</p>



<p>"Focus on portion control, lower fat, lower sodium content, and really focus on the fresh foods, so fresh fruits and vegetables, and integrate those into your diet," explains Dr. Brewer.</p>



<p>Instead of ham, use smoked turkey meat and natural seasonings like oregano and cumin, which can add flavor without all the sodium and fat.</p>



<p>"We may need to revamp how we prepare them by substituting more healthier ingredients so that we can live healthier but still preserve our culture," says Dr. Brewer.</p>

<p>March isÂ <a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Kidney Month</a>, which makes this a good time to learn more about the difference between two kidney disorders â kidney cysts and polycystic kidney disease.</p>



<p>Your kidneys are situated in the back of your abdomen under your lower ribs, one on each side of your spine. One of the important jobs of the kidneys is to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/multimedia/how-kidneys-work-video/vid-20207497?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clean the blood</a>. As blood moves through the body, it picks up extra fluid, chemicals and waste. The kidneys separate this material from the blood, and it's carried out of the body in urine. If the kidneys are unable to do this and the condition is untreated, serious health problems result, with eventual loss of life.</p>



<p>Two kidney disorders with similar names but different circumstances are kidney cysts and polycystic kidney disease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Kidney cysts</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20374134?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidney cysts</a> are round pouches of fluid that form on or in the kidneys. Kidney cysts can occur with disorders that may impair kidney function. But more often, kidney cysts are a type called simple kidney cysts. Simple kidney cysts aren't cancer and rarely cause problems. Complex cysts, however, need to be watched for changes that could be cancer.</p>



<p>In one large study, about 1 in 10 people had simple kidney cysts, and in people 50 and older, nearly 1 in 5 had simple kidney cysts, according to the <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/simple-kidney-cysts#howcommon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disorders</a>.</p>



<p>It's not clear what causes simple kidney cysts. One theory suggests that kidney cysts develop when the surface layer of the kidney weakens and forms a pouch. The pouch then fills with fluid, detaches and develops into a cyst.</p>



<p>Simple kidney cysts typically don't cause symptoms, but if they grow large enough, symptoms may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dull pain in the back or side</li>



<li>Fever</li>



<li>Upper stomach pain</li>
</ul>



<p>If a simple kidney cyst causes no symptoms and doesn't affect kidney function, you may not need treatment. Instead, your health care professional may recommend that you have imaging tests, such as ultrasounds, over time to see whether your kidney cyst changes. If a simple kidney cyst is causing symptoms,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cysts/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374138?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> may include piercing and draining the cyst, then filling it with a solution to prevent recurrence, or surgery to remove the cyst.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Polycystic kidney disease</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352820?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polycystic kidney disease</a> is an inherited disorder in which clusters of noncancerous cysts develop primarily within your kidneys, causing your kidneys to enlarge and lose function over time. The cysts vary in size and can grow very large. Having many cysts or large cysts can damage your kidneys.</p>



<p>Polycystic kidney disease is one of the most common genetic disorders, affecting about 500,000 people in the U.S., according to the <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/polycystic-kidney-disease/what-is-pkd#:~:text=baby%20is%20born-,How%20common%20is%20PKD%3F,people%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;text=ADPKD%20affects%201%20in%20every,affects%201%20in%2020%2C000%20children." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disorders</a>.</p>



<p>Symptoms of polycystic kidney disease can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>High blood pressure</li>



<li>Back or side pain</li>



<li>Blood in your urine</li>



<li>A feeling of fullness in your abdomen</li>



<li>Increased size of your abdomen due to enlarged kidneys</li>



<li>Headaches</li>



<li>Kidney stones</li>



<li>Urinary tract or kidney infections</li>



<li>Kidney failure</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352825?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treating</a> polycystic kidney disease involves dealing with the symptoms and complications in their early stages, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Managing cyst growth with medication.</li>



<li>Delaying progression of the disease by controlling high blood pressure.</li>



<li>Lifestyle strategies to help your kidneys stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible, including maintaining a healthy weight, drinking fluids throughout the day, following a low-salt diet and eating less protein.</li>



<li>Controlling pain.</li>



<li>Prompt treatment of bladder or kidney infections with antibiotics to prevent kidney damage.</li>



<li>Preventing obstructive blood clots in the urinary tract by drinking extra fluids at the first sign of blood in the urine.</li>



<li>Dialysis or a kidney transplant if kidney failure occurs.</li>

<p>Filming and uploading each step of your daytime or nighttime skincare routine is all the rage on social media. And it's especially popular among young girls. But do 8- to 12-year-olds really need to worry about anti-aging serums, expensive cleansers and moisturizers?</p>

<p>Sharing the steps to achieve younger-looking skin is a popular trend seen on social media. It has young girls, in particular, seeking out pricey skincare products with anti-aging properties.</p>



<p>"Oftentimes, these young children will be given complex skincare regimens that are even more complicated than adults will use on their own skin," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>She says a lot of anti-aging products have acids and chemicals in them that can be potentially irritating to gentle or young skin.</p>



<p>"The more often that you expose yourself to a particular chemical, the more likely you are, as you age, to develop an irritant or allergic contact dermatitis from those chemicals," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>She says when it comes to skin in general, less is more.</p>



<p>"The best things that all children can do for their skin mirrors that of adults."</p>



<p>Here's what she recommends for tweens ages 8 through 12:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wash face with water and a gentle cleanser twice a day.</li>



<li>Apply a hypoallergenic, unfragranced or unscented moisturizer to skin.</li>



<li>Apply a sunscreen that contains a physical blocker, such as zinc oxide.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Once you reach pubertal stage or prepuberty, it is helpful to look for moisturizers that are specific to the face and neck if you're looking for cosmetic improvement," adds Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>Sunscreen is recommended for everyone 6 months and older. She also recommends sunscreens of at least SPF 15 when indoors and at least SPF 30 when outdoors.</p>



<p>Something else everyone can do to help keep their skin healthy is to avoid smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.</p>

<p><em>Multiple doctors and multiple examinations could not figure out why Lauri Sieben had spent much of her life ânever feeling quite rightâ physically. Fortunately for Lauri, that changed after her daughter Christy began working as a genetic counselor in Mayo Clinicâs Molecular Technologies Laboratory. After seeing similarities between the patient testing she was performing for the lab and the physical symptoms being experienced by her mom, Christy took a leading role in getting Lauri to undergo molecular and biochemical testing at Mayo Clinic. The results of that testing not only provided much-needed answers, but a promising path forward for Lauri.</em></p>



<p>Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder that prevents the body from producing enough healthy alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-GAL) enzymes. Without functioning alpha-GAL enzymes, harmful levels of fat-like substances called sphingolipids build up in the blood vessels. Over time, this buildup can result in life-threatening damage to the heart, kidneys, brain, and central nervous system.</p>



<p>There are two recognized forms of Fabry disease: classic and late-onset/atypical. Symptoms of classic Fabry disease typically manifest during childhood and progressively worsen over time. People diagnosed with late-onset Fabry disease typically do not experience symptoms until their 30s or older. The first indication of trouble may be kidney failure or heart disease.</p>



<p>For Lauri Sieben, it was âhorrendous tummy problemsâ that began in childhood and carried through into adulthood. âMy mother told me she would take me to the doctor constantly while I was young because they couldn't figure out why I felt horrible all the time,â Lauri says.</p>



<p>Now in her late 60s and newly retired from her career as a scheduler for Mayo Clinic, Lauri had pushed through the mental and physical fog of ânever feeling quite rightâ for decades before her symptoms took a turn for the worse. âProbably about 10 years ago is when the ringing in the ears, the dizziness, and the burning sensation in my hands began,â she says. âNone of the doctors I went to could figure out what was going on.â</p>



<p>Nor could the electrocardiograms Lauri would have done in response to the shortness of breath and chest pain she was also experiencing. âThe results would come back abnormal, but they didnât point to a specific cause, so I was repeatedly sent back home without a diagnosis or treatment plan,â she says.</p>



<p>All of that began to change after Lauriâs daughter, Christy Koellner, began working as a genetic counselor in Mayo Clinicâs Molecular Technologies (formerly Molecular Genetics) Laboratory. âWhen I started, the very first thing I was doing was assessing new patient cases that came into the lab and making sure we had enough information to run the tests,â Christy says. âOne of the testing rotations we had was molecular testing for biochemical disorders, and one of them was Fabry.â</p>



<p>As she settled into her new role with the Molecular Technologies Lab, it didnât take Christy long to make a correlation between the patient testing she was performing, and the physical symptoms being experienced by her mom.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>âI WAS STARTING TO SEE PATIENTS COMING IN WITH RINGING IN THE EARS, DIZZINESS, AND TIAS (TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACKS), AND I IMMEDIATELY STARTED THINKING ABOUT MY MOM,â SHE SAYS. âSHE WAS EXPERIENCING THE SAME THINGS.â</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At first, Christy thought it was just the result of her being a new genetic counselor not long out of graduate school. âIn one of the medical school classes I had to take, they talked about âmed school student syndrome,â where itâs like everything you hear about, you see in somebody,â she says. âSo initially, I thought, âI donât know. I might just be thinking itâs Fabry disease because Iâm directly working with it right now.ââ</p>



<p>But then, after multiple conversations with physician colleagues Ande Rumilla, M.D., and Linda Hasadsri, M.D., Ph.D., about her momâs search for a diagnosis amid her worsening health, Christyâs suspicions and resolve to get her mom tested for Fabry disease solidified.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>âDURING THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION, I LISTED OUT EVERYTHING MY MOM WAS EXPERIENCING â THE RINGING IN THE EARS, THE PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, THE CHEST PAINS, THE DECREASE IN SWEATING, THE CORNEAL PROBLEMS, AND IT ALL JUST STARTED TO CLICK,â CHRISTY SAYS. âIT WAS LIKE âCHECK, CHECK, CHECK,â FOR FABRY DISEASE. AFTER THAT CONVERSATION, I KNEW WE HAD TO GET HER TESTED.â</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Testing brings answers, and treatment</strong></h2>



<p>At Christyâs urging, Lauri underwent molecular and biochemical genetic testing at Mayo Clinic a short time later. The results would give Lauri a mix of emotions. âIt came back positive for Fabry,â she says. âIt was honestly a bit of a shocker, but it was also vindication that all these things that have been happening to me all these years were happening. I wasnât imagining them. After processing it for a bit, I was actually excited to find out what was wrong with me, and I was just hoping there was a treatment for it.â</p>



<p>With a diagnosis now in hand, the next step&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;getting Lauri the treatment she needed to manage her symptoms. That journey began just a couple of days later when she met with Eva Morava-Kozicz, M.D., Ph.D., a clinical genomics physician at Mayo Clinic who would become a key member of Lauriâs care team. âShe saw me right away and was absolutely amazing,â Lauri says. âShe jumped on top of everything and got everything going.â</p>



<p>That âeverythingâ began with enzyme replacement therapy infusions at Mayo Clinic, a first line of defense against Fabry disease intended to give Lauriâs body the missing enzyme it needs to function properly. âItâs helping her body break down all the stored material and is preventing her from getting fatal kidney and heart disease and is also helping with the pain by preventing peripheral nerve damage,â Dr. Morava-Kozicz says. âDepression can be another symptom of Fabry disease, and this therapy can also help prevent that and other central nervous system symptoms.â</p>



<p>For Lauri, her bodyâs response to the enzyme infusions has been encouraging. âIâm definitely feeling better than I was before my diagnosis,â she says. âEverythingâs not perfect, but a lot of the pain in my hands has gone away. I can tell when itâs time for another infusion because my hands and toes will start tingling again.â</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>âIN THE PAST, WHEN WE DIDNâT KNOW THAT FABRY DISEASE IS A GENETIC CONDITION, AND WE DIDNâT KNOW IT COULD BE TREATED, WE JUST TREATED THE SYMPTOMS â THE HYPERTENSION, THE KIDNEY FAILURE, THE HEART DISEASE,â DR. MORAVA-KOZICZ SAYS. âBUT THESE PATIENTS DIED VERY EARLY, AND NOW THAT WE HAVE ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY FOR FABRY DISEASE, WE CAN PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING.â</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The right tests at the right time</strong></h2>



<p>That prevention, of course, cannot begin without accurate diagnostic testing to confirm the presence of Fabry disease, a process for which Mayo Clinic offers multiple approaches. âThe bulk of our Fabry disease testing is done in our Biochemical Genetics Laboratory,â says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hasadsri-linda-m-d-ph-d/bio-20514421">Linda Hasadsri, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a consultant in Mayo Clinicâs Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics who was part of the team that analyzed Lauriâs test results and confirmed her diagnosis. âMayo offers everything from newborn screening for Fabry through dried blood spots to diagnostic testing done through our molecular lab to biomarker testing that helps us monitor the progression of the disease in affected individuals as well as their response to treatment.â</p>



<p>While other medical laboratories offer similar testing options for Fabry disease, Amy White, a genetic counselor in Mayo Clinicâs Biochemical Genetics Laboratory, says what sets Mayo Clinic apart is the biomarker testing thatâs also used to add an additional layer of accuracy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>âWE OFFER BOTH URINE CERAMIDE TRIHEXIDES AND BLOOD LYSO, AND THOSE IN COMBINATION OR INDIVIDUALLY ARE AN EXTRA DATA POINT THAT CAN HELP US DETERMINE IF A PATIENT IS TRULY AFFECTED BY FABRY DISEASE,â WHITE SAYS. âSOMETIMES THERE ARE DNA CHANGES THAT ARE FOUND, AND WE DONâT KNOW IF THEY CAUSE DISEASE OR NOT. OUR BIOMARKER TESTING IS A FUNCTIONAL TEST AND ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THAT CAN TELL US WHETHER A PERSON IS TRULY AFFECTED BY FABRY DISEASE.â</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Not just a manâs disease</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to timely and accurate laboratory testing, an equally important component to Lauri getting the diagnosis and treatment plan she needed to manage her symptoms was breaking through the misconception that Fabry disease is a genetic disorder that only affects men. âWhen Christy and I first began suspecting and asking about Fabry disease, we had at least one clinician say, âNo, thatâs a manâs disease,ââ Lauri says. âIt was dismissed right away.â</p>



<p>Since Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder, White says it is true that Fabry is typically diagnosed in males more than females, but as Lauriâs case shows, it can still very much affect females.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>âITâS A MISNOMER THAT FEMALES ARE JUST CARRIERS OF FABRY DISEASE,â WHITE SAYS. âTHE MAJORITY OF FEMALES WHO HAVE A DNA CHANGE IN THE GENE FOR FABRY DISEASE DO HAVE SYMPTOMS, BUT THOSE SYMPTOMS MAY PRESENT LATER IN LIFE, AND THEY MAY PRESENT DIFFERENTLY THAN THEY DO IN MALES.â</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The challenge for physicians is then determining both when and how to test a patient suspected of having Fabry. âClinicians who care for pediatric patients and have a male patient with unexplained burning pain in their hands and feet should definitely consider testing for Fabry disease given that we know that is a hallmark early sign of Fabry,â White says. âIâve also encountered females who have had the burning hand and foot pain as early as age 8 to 10, but itâs much more common in males at that age. Females with cardiomyopathy are the next group of patients where we should think about Fabry disease in the differential diagnosis. And then, of course, any males or females with kidney disease moving toward kidney failure should also be assessed for Fabry. And finally, ophthalmologists may see corneal whirling in males or females with Fabry disease, and that could be the initial symptom thatâs present and detected for this condition.â</p>

<p>Once Fabry is suspected, itâs important to understand which test to order to accurately confirm or rule out that suspicion. âFor males, you can order enzyme or DNA testing, but with females, itâs really best to order DNA testing first because you can get false positives and false negatives with enzyme testing for females,â White says.</p>



<p>To which Dr. Hasadsri adds: âFabry testing for females is tricky. There is a danger with female patients of only doing biochemical testing in that if thatâs negative, youâre actually not done testing. You still need to do molecular testing to make an accurate diagnosis. Doing molecular-only testing can also be equivocal, so doing additional biochemical testing can help resolve variants of uncertain significance.â</p>



<p>For Christy, the benefits of having all of those testing options available in one place for her mom have been immeasurable. âMy mom has always been a very light and airy person â very Zen-like. And after her diagnosis and treatment began, there was a veil lifted from her that I didnât even know was there,â Christy says. âThereâs more of a sense of peace that comes off of her now. Itâs just so wonderful that we were able to get the testing she needed, and that it was all available right here at Mayo Clinic.â</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Lyme disease&nbsp;is a bacterial infection caused by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, commonly known as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lyme-disease/multimedia/deer-tick/img-20007610?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deer tick</a>.</p>



<p>It is most common in the Upper Midwest and the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. And it's also common in Europe, Asia, and in south-central and southeastern Canada.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms</h2>



<p>Patients may present with a rash at the site of the tick bite â classically with a bull's-eye rash. But that's not always the case.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Lyme-disease-rash-arm-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Lyme disease rash on male arm - caused by a deer tick" class="wp-image-382167" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Lyme-disease-rash-arm-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Lyme-disease-rash-arm-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Lyme-disease-rash-arm-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Lyme-disease-rash-arm-16x9-1-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Lyme-disease-rash-arm-16x9-1.jpg 1578w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">&nbsp;People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>"Also, some people may have a rash and not know if it's on the back of their head or another hard-to-see&nbsp;and&nbsp;hard-to-reach area. If the infection is not treated right away, the patient may then&nbsp;progress to having other symptoms, like disseminated rashes, joint pain, arthritis and even neurologic involvement. And they can even have one-sided facial paralysis, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bells-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370028?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bell's palsy</a>," says Dr. Pritt.</p>



<p>Lab tests help confirm or rule out diagnoses of Lyme disease. Dr. Pritt says that <a href="https://news.mayocliniclabs.com/about-us/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Laboratories </a>perform more than 300,000 tests for tick-borne diseases each year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to seek medical care</h2>



<p>Dr. Pritt says that finding a tick on you and removing it promptly is not a reason to seek medical attention, especially for those living where ticks are a daily occurrence.</p>



<p>However, "If a patient lives in an area where there's a lot of Lyme disease, finding a tick that's been attached to them for more than 24 hours, ideally more than 36 hours, that in and of itself is enough to prompt them to go to their physician to see if they should get some antibiotics to prevent Lyme disease," she says.</p>



<p>"If someone were to present with any illness during the spring, summer or fall months when they have been exposed to ticks â where they may have a rash, a headache, a fever â those could all be signs of tick-borne diseases, Lyme disease and other diseases. And that should prompt them to go to their physician," says Dr. Pritt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h2>



<p>The best way to avoid infection is to avoid getting a tick bite. Dr. Pritt says it's important for people to protect themselves from tick bites. Avoiding tick bites will protect them not just from Lyme disease, but also many other tick-borne infections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tick bite prevention tips:</p>



<ul>
<li>When possible, avoid areas where ticks are frequently found.</li>



<li>Use a repellent with 30% or more of DEET.</li>



<li>Wear clothing that covers your arms and legs.</li>



<li>Tuck pants into socks while hiking.</li>
</ul>



<p>"I also like oil of lemon eucalyptus, shown by the Environmental Protection Agency to be almost as effective as DEET, and smells a little better. Also, wearing permethrin sprayed on clothing is helpful. That also will repel and even kill ticks. Then, just cover up with clothing so that the ticks can't get to your skin. If you tuck your pants into your socks, you're taking away an avenue for ticks to get to your legs to bite you," she says.</p>

<p>Sodium is added to many processed foods, including packaged and frozen meals. Many recipes call for salt in the ingredients, and many people add table salt to their food for flavor. But according to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-ivan-e-ii-m-d/bio-20113830?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ivan Porter II</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/nephrology-hypertension/sections/overview/ovc-20464571?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nephrologist</a>, adding too much salt to your diet is not a good thing. A recent <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2813410?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=122823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that adding salt to your food can increase your risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic kidney disease</a>.</p>

<p>Your kidneys balance the amount of sodium in your body. If you're getting too much, it builds up in your blood. Your heart works harder to pump and increases blood pressure, raising the risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/multimedia/vid-20522473?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney disease</a>.</p>



<p>"Chronic kidney disease â that's the way that we describe what occurs when the kidney has issues with filtering wastes and toxins from the blood," says Dr. Porter.</p>



<p>Sodium is added to most processed foods. It's also in a lot of condiments. "So it's very easy for us to get way more sodium than we need. And it's very easy for us to get a dangerous amount of sodium that has some impact on our blood pressure or our overall health," he says.</p>



<p>The recommended daily limit of sodium is 2,300 milligrams, or about 1 teaspoon. Dr. Porter recommends reading food labels. And cut back on the saltshaker by using salt-free seasonings.</p>



<p>"Sometimes you can either stop or reverse some of the initial damage that happens with chronic kidney disease. The longer that the process goes on, the more severe it is, the less likely it is to be able to get back to healthy kidneys. And that's when we have to think about things to replace kidney function like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/dialysis-programs/overview/ovc-20464948?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialysis</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a>," he says.</p>

<p>Approximately half of the world's population lives in areas vulnerable to dengue fever, particularly in hot and humid tropical and subtropical climates.</p>



<p>"That's why you see it in parts of the world such as Southeast Asia, South America, the Caribbean, and even some parts of the southern U.S., around Florida and Louisiana.," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>The primary transmitter of dengue fever is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, known to bite during both day and night. About 1 in 4 people infected with the virus will experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of dengue fever</h2>



<p>"They usually notice fevers, body aches, bone aches, muscle aches; many times, they even describe an aching behind their eyes. They can get some nausea, vomiting and even diarrhea," Dr. Rizza says.</p>



<p>While most people recover within about a week, severe cases can lead to life-threatening emergencies.</p>



<p>Symptoms of severe dengue fever may include:</p>



<p>â¢ Severe stomach pain.<br>â¢ Persistent vomiting.<br>â¢ Bleeding from your gums or nose.<br>â¢ Blood in your urine, stool or vomit.<br>â¢ Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising.<br>â¢ Difficult or rapid breathing.<br>â¢ Fatigue.<br>â¢ Irritability or restlessness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no medicine to treat dengue fever.</p>



<p>"There's no antiviral or no treatment for dengue fever," she says. "It's what we call supportive therapy. Maintaining good hydration, particularly as people are sick and having fevers, is important. They can use acetaminophen to take care of the fevers, bring down the temperature, and then ensure they take in fluids and still get some form of eating."</p>



<p>"If they become severely ill and aren't able to keep up with their fluid status, they should go to their hospital and may require hospitalization to help support them," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>Though there is no direct treatment, a vaccine is approved in many countries for children ages 9 -16 who have previously shown evidence of dengue infection. Dr. Rizza says the vaccine is not approved in the U.S.</p>



<p>"You give it to people who have already had immunologic evidence of a previous dengue infection, and then you give it to them to help prevent them from becoming reinfected," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h2>



<p>Preventing mosquito bites is vital to avoiding dengue fever. Here are some strategies:</p>



<p>â¢ Use bug spray with DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus to prevent mosquito bites.<br>â¢ Remove any stagnant water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.<br>â¢ Eliminate items that hold water, such as vases and flowerpot saucers.<br>â¢ Ensure intact window screens and closed doors to keep mosquitoes outside.<br>â¢ Wear protective clothing like long sleeves and pants.</p>



<p>The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for several viral infections, including dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika.</p>

<p><br>The infection is characterized by a severe hacking cough followed by a high-pitched intake of breath that sounds like "whoop."</p>



<p>"Generally, the kids who have it can have bouts of coughing where they can't catch their breath. And then after the coughing is finished, they take a big, deep breath to catch their breath from it, and that's where that whooping sound comes from," Dr. Rajapakse says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Early symptoms of whooping cough</h2>



<ul>
<li>Runny nose.</li>



<li>Nasal congestion.</li>



<li>Red, watery eyes.</li>



<li>Fever.</li>



<li>Cough.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Â Later symptoms of whooping cough</h2>



<ul>
<li>Vomiting during or after coughing fits.</li>



<li>Struggling to breathe.</li>



<li>Extreme fatigue or exhaustion.</li>



<li>Ending with a high-pitched "whoop" sound during the next breath of air.</li>
</ul>



<p>Not everyone with the infection will develop a whoop-sounding cough, and infants may not cough at all. Instead, they may struggle to breathe, or they may even stop breathing temporarily.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to seek medical attentionÂ </h2>



<ul>
<li>Struggling to breathe.</li>



<li>Turning blue or purpose.</li>



<li>Coughing violently or rapidly.</li>



<li>Not drinking enough fluids.</li>
</ul>



<p>People of all ages can become infected. However, whooping&nbsp;cough is especially dangerous for babies, particularly those under 6 months. It can lead to severe breathing issues, which may require hospitalization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prevention</h2>



<p>Whooping cough is a vaccine preventable disease. "Thankfully, this is an infection we have a vaccination for," says Dr. Rajapakse.Â </p>



<p>There are two types of vaccine available:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Diphtheria, tetanus, Pertussis&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/diphtheria-tetanus-and-acellular-pertussis-vaccine-intramuscular-route/description/drg-20071366">DTaP</a>)</strong><br>This vaccine is for children younger than 7 years old.</li>



<li><strong>Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/diphtheria-tetanus-and-acellular-pertussis-booster-vaccine-intramuscular-route/description/drg-20122575">Tdap</a>)</strong><br>This vaccine is for older children and adults, including pregnant women.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Tdap is recommended for pregnant women in each pregnancy to provide babies with early protection against pertussis. This is crucial because the first few months of life pose the highest risk for serious illness, and babies don't receive their first pertussis vaccine dose until they're 2 months old.</p>



<p>Dr. Rajapakse says it's important for anyone in close contact with newborns and young infants, such as parents, grandparents or child care providers, to ensure they are up to date on their pertussis vaccination.</p>



<p>Practicing good&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-proper-way-to-wash-your-hands/">hand hygiene</a>&nbsp;also can help reduce the spread of respiratory infections.</p>
