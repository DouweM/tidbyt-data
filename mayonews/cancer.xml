<p>According to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/cancer-facts-and-figures-for-hispanics-and-latinos/hispanic-latino-2021-2023-cancer-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;by the American Cancer Society, cancer is a leading cause of death among those of Hispanic heritage living in the U.S. Hispanic and Latino people are less likely to be diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-reducing-your-risk-of-lung-cancer/">lung</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/colorectal-cancer-myths-and-facts/">colon</a>, breast and&nbsp;prostate cancers&nbsp;than non-Hispanic white men and women.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesus-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jesse Bracamonte,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says preventive screenings for cancer and other diseases are effective ways to help reduce these burdens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/09/SCRIPT-MCM-Preventive-screenings-Hispanic75-RM21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"Colorectal cancers and breast cancers are on the rise in the Hispanic community. And one of those reasons may be from lack of preventive screening," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says culture, access to care and past experiences contribute. But early screening can prevent future serious health issues.</p>



<p>"Screening tests for diabetes&nbsp;(such as checking a simple blood sugar), for cardiovascular disease to prevent strokes&nbsp;(such as checking on cholesterol and blood pressure), colon cancer screening,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/when-to-start-regular-breast-cancer-screenings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer screening</a>&nbsp;for females, are all available tools," he says.</p>



<p>Talk with your doctor to determine the right preventive screenings and when to begin. For instance:&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Colon cancer screening for both men and women, usually at age 45, is an option, breast cancer screening for women in their 40s such as with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram,</a>" he says.</p>

<p>Dr. Bracamonte recommends having a list of questions for your doctor about what you can do to stay healthy.</p>



<p>"Have that list prepared about what I should get done to keep me healthy in the long term. What behaviors can I do in the long term to stay healthy? Because I think prevention is a key," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/car-tcell-infographic/ifg-20511593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> is a treatment that harnesses the power of a person's immune system to combat cancer cells. In this regenerative immunotherapy, a person's T cells, or white blood cells known as lymphocytes that are involved in the immune system response — are collected and genetically modified to produce chimeric antigen receptors or CARs. They are then infused back into the patient's blood stream, where they target and destroy cancer cells. Mayo Clinic researchers are advancing and improving CAR-T cell therapy to expand its capabilities to treat more conditions. Read more about the latest advances in CAR-T at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While many CAR-T cell therapies use a patient's own cells, Mayo Clinic is also exploring the applications of allogeneic, or "off-the-shelf," CAR-T therapies. These are generated by healthy donors or gene-edited sources that have been genetically altered to reduce the possibility of rejection by the patient's immune system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This can provide a faster turnaround time for manufacturing, expand patient access and allow patients to receive CAR-T cell therapy at the time of need," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lin-yi-m-d-ph-d/bio-00092684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yi Lin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a hematologist and oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. </p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy is usually offered as a later-stage therapy for various blood cancers, but recent research has shown it may be useful in some blood cancer cases earlier in a patient's treatment plan.</p>



<p>"CAR-T cell therapy in earlier lines of treatment has reported superior outcomes as compared to using it in later lines of therapy," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fonseca-rafael-m-d/bio-00083333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rafael Fonseca, M.D.</a>, hematologist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. </p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers are working to apply <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> to solid tumors in thyroid cancer. CAR-T has shown promising results in blood cancers, and new research is focused on using this treatment on more types of malignancies.</p>



<p>"CAR-T cell therapy is unlike other therapeutics," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a hematologist and cancer researcher.&nbsp;"Other therapies may slow down cancer.

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> could provide a revolutionary approach to organ transplantation for "sensitized patients" who are hard to match and susceptible to rejection, Mayo Clinic researchers discovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their pioneering research focuses on using CAR-T cells derived from the patient's own immune system to prevent rejection of donated organs. Sensitized patients are those who have high levels of antibodies that cause their immune systems to react negatively to potential donor organs. These patients often face extended waiting periods for a transplant.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Research from this proof-of-concept study is published in <a href="https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(24)00159-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidney International</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"This research is one of the first steps toward applying CAR-T cells in the field of transplantation to try to make more donor organs available for transplant and reduce the wait for patients who need a new kidney," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/jarmi-tambi-m-d/bio-20536410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tambi Jarmi, M.D.</a>, first author on the study and a transplant nephrologist at Mayo Clinic in Florida.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic scientists have developed an immunotherapy strategy that potentially lays the groundwork for treating a spectrum of autoimmune diseases.</p>



<p>The new technique, detailed in a preclinical study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01195-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Biomedical Engineering</a>, involves combining chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which are found in various tissues in the body and are known for calming down the immune system, controlling inflammation and promoting immune tolerance to prevent the body's own tissues from being attacked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The pioneering approach shows potential in targeting inflammatory disease sites more precisely and improving immunosuppression and healing outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kenderian</a>. "We're planning to study interventions that minimize the need for long-term medications for autoimmune diseases."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic cancer researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vile-richard-g-ph-d/bio-00027663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</a>, is leading research into genetically engineered viruses aimed at unleashing a two-pronged attack on cancer. One part of this technology, known as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/oncolytic-virus-optimizes-car-t-cell-therapy-for-solid-tumors/mac-20537878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oncolytic virus</a>, is designed to infect, break open and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. Dr. Vile's <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn2231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preclinical studies</a> have shown that oncolytic viruses replicated in cancer cells and cascaded to kill other diseased cells. That, in turn, triggered an immune response in which the patient's own T cells, stimulated by the virus, recognized and targeted metastasized tumors for a second wave of cancer destruction.</p>



<p>"Oncolytic viruses are a way to alert the immune system and mobilize it to kill cells infected with cancer," says Dr. Vile. "There's the direct killing of cancer cells with the virus, and then there's the major effect of immune activation. The immune system is incredibly well evolved to recognize infection, clear infection and kill all the cells around it that could be harboring infection."&nbsp; </p>



<p>Dr. Vile's team is combining oncolytic viruses with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> to target solid tumors from liver cancer. This experimental approach of loading CAR-T cells with oncolytic virus is a new way to expand CAR-T cell therapy beyond treatment for blood cancers into treatment for solid tumors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic research has developed a new type of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> aimed at killing B-cell blood cancers that have returned and are no longer responding to treatment. This pioneering technology, designed and developed in the lab of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/qin-hong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20492736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Qin, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, killed B-cell tumors grown in the laboratory and tumors implanted in mouse models. The preclinical findings are published in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00262-023-03537-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This study shows our experimental CAR-T cell therapy targets several blood cancers, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia," says Dr. Qin. "Currently there are six different CAR-T cell therapies approved for treatment of relapsed blood cancers. While the results are impressive, not everyone responds to this treatment. Our goal is to provide novel cell therapies shaped to each patient's individual need."</p>



<p>Dr Qin's team developed a cell therapy to target a protein known as B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) found in patients with B-cell cancers, particularly those with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a>. The BAFF-R protein is linked to tumor growth. The cell therapy under investigation allows the immune system to quash cancer and target tumors that have returned or have resisted available CAR-T cell therapies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers who mined the molecular foundations of cancer have uncovered a new reason <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a> fails in some patients. This discovery has fueled new strategies that incorporate antibodies and gene editing to improve the outcome of this breakthrough treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This is a very exciting discovery that offers new hope of overcoming challenges of CAR-T cell therapy that many cancer patients experience," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kenderian</a>, a hematologist and senior author on this research, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51978-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We describe for the first time a mechanism causing the resistance and failure of CAR-T cells, which lies within a protein routinely made by the engineered cells. This research puts us on a new path for improving the longevity of CAR-T cell therapy."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Editor's Note: <em>September is Leukemia and Lymphoma Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Treatment for blood cancers is advancing, giving more options to people living with the disease.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ailawadhi-sikander-m-d/bio-20087330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sikander Ailawadhi, M.D.</a>, an oncologist and hematologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/international" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Jacksonville, Florida, says that physicians are identifying, monitoring and eliminating disease earlier and more deeply, thanks to targeted drug therapies and novel treatments like CAR-T cell therapy. Dr. Ailawadhi is an expert in blood cancers, particularly myeloma.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/03/Sikander-Ailawadhi_1488206_3715287_0005-300x200.jpg" alt="portrait of Dr. Sikander Ailawadhi" class="wp-image-361995" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/03/Sikander-Ailawadhi_1488206_3715287_0005-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/03/Sikander-Ailawadhi_1488206_3715287_0005-768x513.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/03/Sikander-Ailawadhi_1488206_3715287_0005.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Sikander Ailawadhi</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Worldwide, cancer is a leading cause of death, accounting for nearly 10 million — nearly 1 in 6 — deaths in 2020, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Health Organization</a>. New cases of blood cancers —&nbsp; leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma — were expected to account for <a href="https://tlls.org/facts-and-statistics/facts-and-statistics-overview/facts-and-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 10% </a>&nbsp;of new cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. in 2020.</p>



<p>Drug treatments for blood cancers have evolved. In the past, myeloma patients received two drugs in sequence — two after two. Now, they receive four drugs together at once, with more patients going into remission. Some treatments are becoming so effective — even after a stem-cell transplant — that a subset of patients may be able to stop their medications altogether, Dr. Ailawadhi says. Clinical trials studying that approach are underway.</p>



<p>Blood cancer patients have more immunotherapies available, including CAR-T, which uses the body's immune system to fight cancer. CAR-T involves genetically modifying T cells to activate the immune system to find and kill certain cancers. The Food and Drug Administration approved CAR-T for certain types of leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. The therapy is now in clinical trials as a potential option for breast, brain, pancreatic cancer, sarcoma and rheumatoid disorders such as lupus.</p>



<p>If patients can't receive CAR-T, they may be able to receive a class of drugs called T-cell engagers. Unlike CAR-T, T-cell engagers do not need to be manufactured. Typically, patients receive T-cell engagers on an inpatient basis. However, at Mayo Clinic, the treatment is outpatient, Dr. Ailawadhi says.</p>



<p>"Historically a patient who had cancer for 10 years did not suddenly go into remission and stay in remission," Dr. Ailawadhi says. "Now with these novel options like CAR-T and T-cell engagers, even patients who have had years of cancer are going into remission."</p>



<p>If their cancer eventually returns, patients may be able to receive treatments that were not available when they were originally diagnosed. A few years ago, Dr. Ailawadhi treated a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/john-cadwallader-has-hope-time-and-new-options-after-car-t-treatment-for-multiple-myeloma/">man</a> with myeloma from the U.K. The patient received CAR-T at Mayo Clinic and went into remission, but the disease returned about nine months later. By that time, new clinical trials had become available in the U.K. The patient started care locally and is being monitored by his Mayo team from Florida and London.</p>



<p>"With that time, he was able to get to more options for treatments," Dr. Ailawadhi says.</p>



<p>The sensitivity of diagnostic tests has advanced, allowing oncologists to tell if a patient has achieved a deep response. Tests can detect one cancer cell in 100,000 normal cells. As techniques improve, tests eventually may be able to detect one in 1 million or one in 10 million, Dr. Ailawadhi says. In the future, researchers hope to construct a predictive model that could tell patients how likely they are to achieve a depth of response, get into remission and stop their medications.</p>



<p>Some patients also can receive care at home. A subset of stem-cell transplant patients come to the hospital for three days of treatment, and then transition to care at home, Dr. Ailawadhi says. Medications for managing pain, nausea and other side effects of blood cancers have evolved too. Large centers may offer patients resources for palliative care, pain medicine, interventional radiology, psychology, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.</p>



<p>"It's very important to understand the patient's quality of life before the cancer," Dr. Ailawadhi says. "One of the major goals of treatment is to try to get the patient as close as possible to that again while we work to control the cancer."</p>

<p>Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, or TIL therapy, uses the body's own immune cells to target cancer — in this case, advanced melanoma. The process, which takes about three weeks, begins with surgery.</p>



<p>"We remove the cancer; it's sent off to a lab, and those immune cells, those lymphocytes, are isolated, separated out and enriched."</p>



<p>While the cells are prepared, the patient undergoes chemotherapy in preparation for their own immune cells, which recognize the melanoma, to be infused back into their body.</p>



<p>"When we give them back to the patient, they can effectively target the cancer," says Dr. Jakub. And now, in numbers, they can overwhelm the cancer and kill it."</p>



<p>Blood tests and scans measure the body's response three months after treatment. For those who have failed multiple lines of treatment, this one-time therapy offers hope.</p>



<p>"It's the potential that their cancer may not come back again, and they may not need any additional therapy," says Dr. Jakub.</p>

<p>Genetic technology has the potential to significantly improve human health by improving disease risk prediction and guiding prevention strategies. The development of a new genetic test called a polygenic risk score is a major advance. Still, it may widen health disparities because such scores may not work equally well for different populations. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kullo-iftikhar-j-m-d/bio-00084951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iftikhar Kullo, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic, believes that global collaboration is needed to refine polygenic risk scores so they perform equitably across people from diverse groups.</p>



<p>Dr. Kullo recently authored a perspective piece in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01843-2#:~:text=Such%20collaborations%20should%20be%20guided,assessment%2C%20global%20collaboration%20is%20critical." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Genetics</a>, where he made the case for efforts to bring genomics to low- and middle-income countries. His argument is that the information gleaned from testing could not only benefit local populations but also many other groups around the world, including in the U.S. Here, he elaborates on this.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You've noted that the disease burden worldwide is shifting from communicable diseases such as &nbsp;hepatitis and influenza to noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer. How can genetics address this shift?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> The shift from infectious disease to noncommunicable disease is part of the "epidemiologic transition." Famines and pandemics were once the leading cause of mortality, but fortunately, these were addressed by antibiotics, vaccinations and adequate food production. Now, we live longer and, as a result, are prone to developing other diseases like heart disease, diabetes or cancer. One of the ways that we can reduce the burden of these noncommunicable diseases is to employ better ways of predicting risk. For many of these conditions, we have existing tools for risk prediction, but they don't always perform as well as we would like them to.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You are referring to a new genetic test called a polygenic risk score. Could you explain what a polygenic risk score is, and how it works?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Genetically, humans are 99.9% similar. Our genome has three billion letters (A, G, T and C), and every 1,000 letters or so, there is a variation or difference between any two people. These differences, or variants, account for how we look or behave, how we might react to drugs, and our predisposition to different diseases. Polygenic risk scores add up information from multiple such genetic variants that affect our risk of developing certain diseases. Each variant is not very useful by itself, but if we combine the information from many — thousands or even millions of variants in some cases — we get useful and actionable information about disease risk.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the limitation of polygenic risk scores? How could they widen global health disparities?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Polygenic risk scores don't perform well across different genetic ancestry groups. Because the vast majority of genetic studies are done in people of European genetic ancestry, these scores don't work very well, for example, in people of African genetic ancestry. One way we can address that disparity is to increase diversity in our studies here in the U.S., but an even better approach may be to undertake a global effort, conducting this work in diverse regions across the globe. We know that using diverse sources of data will improve the performance of these scores for everybody.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You wrote that African datasets are still a high priority for genomic studies. Yet, they are the least represented — less than 2% of human genomes analyzed so far are of people with African genetic ancestry. How can studying African genomes help advance our understanding of the genomic basis of common diseases in all people?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> Africa contains the greatest genetic diversity among the continents, accumulated over 300,000 years of human evolution. By studying people of African ancestry, we will learn so much more about human origins and genetics because we're all Africans, in a way — that's where Homo sapiens arose. That long evolutionary history means that African populations could yield more information about genetic variants associated with disease. And it's a chance to make up for this big disparity in the number of Africans in genomic studies thus far.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What steps do you believe are necessary to achieve equity in the availability of polygenic risk scores to improve global health?</p>



<p><strong>Dr. Kullo:</strong> We certainly need to increase the representation of minorities in genomic studies. Mayo Clinic is part of a large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded consortium called <a href="https://emerge.study/mayo-clinic/">eMERGE</a> that is looking at polygenic risk scores for 10 common conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, breast cancer and prostate cancer. The consortium is committed to ensuring that at least half of the 25,000 participants across the country come from diverse groups.</p>



<p>It's important to learn about the spectrum of genetic variation in all of humanity, not just in one group. I believe that means going beyond our borders, helping other countries to set up infrastructure to generate their own genetic data and creating resources for data-sharing across the globe. It's not an easy task, but we have many elements in place, and I think it's doable.</p>

<p>Palliative medicine is a medical specialty whose main focus is supporting patients and families/caregivers who need help managing symptoms related to cancer or side effects related to the treatment of cancer, along with other life-limiting diseases.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/barksdale-toure-m-d/bio-20517681">Dr. Touré Barksdale</a>, a Mayo Clinic cancer rehabilitation and palliative medicine specialist, explains the benefits of palliative care.</p>

<p>Patients with cancer not only have to worry about fighting the disease, but they also must battle the cumbersome side effects, like fatigue and other symptoms related to cancer and its treatment.</p>



<p>"Side effects from cancer and treatment of cancer, such as pain, delirium, nausea, vomiting and debility, can also contribute to their cancer-related fatigue," says Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Palliative care provides relief </h2>

<p>Palliative medicine is a crucial component of cancer treatment. Its main purpose is to improve the patient's overall well-being.</p>



<p>"Whether that's more holistic care through integrative and complementary medicine, more Western-based medicines, psychological care, music therapy, aromatherapy, Reiki, tai chi — we have lots of things we can do to help reduce suffering," explains Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<p>Palliative care is not the same as hospice care. The latter focuses on making patients comfortable and managing symptoms nearing the end of life when further curative treatments are no longer available.</p>



<p>"Palliative care, to me, is hope because what we're doing is we're improving your quality of life," says Dr. Barksdale.</p>



<p>This type of care is available at any stage of cancer treatment.</p>

<p>"Prostate cancer is incredibly common, probably going to be diagnosed in about 300,000 men this year in the United States," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sartor-alton-o-m-d/bio-20548417?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Oliver Sartor</a>, a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist.</p>



<p>Dr. Sartor, whose practice is focused on prostate cancer, stresses the importance of screening for the disease with a prostate-specific antigen test, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/psa-test/about/pac-20384731?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSA</a>.</p>



<p>"I think the No. 1 issue of being diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer is not getting a PSA," he says.</p>



<p>It's a blood test that's analyzed for prostate-specific antigen, a substance naturally produced by your prostate. If a high amount of PSA is found in your bloodstream, it could indicate prostate infection, inflammation, enlargement or cancer.</p>



<p>"I think generally starting at age 50 is a very reasonable number to start getting a PSA. But if you are African American or have a significant family history of prostate cancer or have a genetic alteration that might predispose to prostate cancer, then you should probably get one even earlier," says Dr. Sartor.</p>



<p>If the PSA detects an abnormality, further tests, such as ultrasound, MRI or a biopsy, may be recommended to determine if you have prostate cancer.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/mammography-quality-standards-act-and-program/important-information-final-rule-amend-mammography-quality-standards-act-mqsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food and Drug Administration</a> issued a rule in March of 2023 that requires healthcare professionals to notify people if they have dense breasts.

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/robinson-kristin-a-m-d/bio-20466711?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kristin Robinson</a>, a Mayo Clinic breast radiologist, says women with dense breast tissue are at a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer compared to women without, and that’s why early detection is so important.</p>



<p>"About 50% of women have dense breast tissue," says Dr. Robinson.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/TrYQiUsckmQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: What does a diagnosis of dense breasts mean?</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (01:04) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."

<p>Dr. Robinson says you can't tell by looking at a woman whether she has dense breasts. She says people with dense breasts have less fat and more glandular and connective tissue in their breasts.</p>



<p>"When we see a woman's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/multimedia/mammogram/vid-20084742?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram,</a> that dense tissue, that fibroglandular tissue, looks white, whereas the fat looks dark or like a black color. So, when we're looking at a mammogram, the more white tissue we see, the more dense a woman’s breasts are considered," says Dr. Robinson.</p>



<p>She says it's difficult to detect cancer in dense breasts because breast cancer and dense tissue appear white on a mammogram.</p>



<p>"Our sensitivity or our ability to detect breast cancer goes down in women who have dense breast tissue for that reason," she explains.</p>

<p>The radiologist encourages women with dense breast tissue to have supplemental screenings.</p>



<p>"Whole-breast screening ultrasound, MRI, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/molecular-breast-imaging/about/pac-20394710?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">molecular breast imaging</a>, and contrast-enhanced mammography" are some options patients might consider, says Dr. Robinson.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic healthcare professionals recommend annual mammograms starting at age 40 for most women. In addition, a personalized breast cancer risk assessment is suggested at age 30 for all women to see if screening is needed before age 40.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> will enhance and expand access to cancer care and clinical trials for patients and communities, thanks to a generous philanthropic commitment from Stephen M. and Barbara J. Slaggie of Marco Island, Florida, and Winona, Minnesota.</p>



<p>The Slaggies' $50 million investment accelerates Mayo Clinic's Bold. Forward. strategy to Cure, Connect and Transform healthcare by supporting <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> in revolutionizing the delivery of cancer care. Mayo Clinic is leading this shift by developing the optimal blend of in-facility, digital and home-based care to reach more patients beyond traditional care delivery methods.</p>



<p>Already, through the creation of innovative programs, including Cancer Care Beyond Walls and Clinical Trials Beyond Walls — in collaboration with partners in Mayo Clinic's practice and research endeavors — Mayo Clinic is delivering chemotherapy and clinical trials to patients in their homes and community environments.</p>



<p>"Through our platform-based strategies, Mayo Clinic is enabling the delivery of cancer care and clinical trials broadly to patients and communities across the United States and around the world, overcoming geographic barriers to assure access to quality cancer care and clinical trials to patients anywhere, at any time," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/willman-cheryl-l-m-d/bio-20537787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cheryl Willman, M.D.</a>, the Stephen and Barbara Slaggie Executive Director, Mayo Clinic Cancer Programs, and director, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is the only National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center with three integrated geographic sites — in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota — achieving national and international recognition for the delivery of advanced and complex cancer care. For over five decades, Mayo Clinic has made important contributions as a leading cancer center because of a focus on patient-centered care, multidisciplinary team science, and translation of cutting-edge research from the bench to the bedside and into communities.</p>



<p>The Slaggies' support for enhanced access to Mayo Clinic knowledge and expertise, cancer care delivery, cancer clinical trials, and community outreach and engagement will enable more patients to access Mayo Clinic's innovative and expert care, no matter where they live. Key activities advanced through this gift include enhancing platform and digital tools to deliver cancer care and trials anywhere, developing community partnerships, and recruiting patient navigators and clinical staff to expand Mayo Clinic's Cancer Care Beyond Walls and Clinical Trials Beyond Walls programs to Mayo Clinic partners.</p>



<p>Making care more accessible inspired the Slaggies.</p>



<p>"Being a cancer survivor, I know firsthand the anxiety of seeking prompt, exceptional care," Stephen Slaggie says. "We're honored to help people with cancer by providing treatment in their home without the time, expense and travel involved in accessing a clinic or hospital."</p>



<p>For example, through its Cancer Care Beyond Walls program, Mayo Clinic has successfully delivered more than 140 chemotherapy infusions in patients' homes and has opened three national clinical trials testing the safety, efficacy and patient satisfaction of this approach.</p>



<p>"Think of what this means for patients who are going through a cancer diagnosis," Dr. Willman says. "Access to cutting-edge therapies from the most trusted name in healthcare, all in the healing environment of your home."</p>



<p>Areas benefiting from the Slaggies' gift include:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cancer Care Delivery/Cancer Care Beyond Walls</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic is transforming cancer care delivery by blending virtual, in-facility and at-home treatments to meet our patients where they are. By expanding these innovative programs, Mayo Clinic will enhance the patient and family experience and ensure Mayo's high-quality science and care reach all communities.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is also extending the Cancer Care Beyond Walls program, which began in Florida, to Mayo Clinic Health System, a community-based rural healthcare delivery system serving 49 communities across Minnesota and Wisconsin; Mayo Clinic in Arizona; partners in the Mayo Clinic Care Network; and, ultimately, healthcare systems around the nation and globe. Cancer Care Beyond Walls is using virtual and digital platforms and allied health teams to deliver cancer treatment, cancer chemotherapy and cancer clinical trials in the home environment, reducing the financial and emotional burden for patients with cancer who may otherwise have to travel long distances for care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cancer Clinical Trials/Clinical Trials Beyond Walls</h2>



<p>Each year, Mayo Clinic conducts thousands of clinical trials that are pioneering possible cures, yet there remain significant societal, geographic and logistical barriers that prevent some patients from accessing those options. The ability to decentralize clinical trials assures access for patients and communities by overcoming these barriers.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is addressing these systemic issues by using new digital tools — developed by its Center for Digital Health, <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform</a> and Mayo's research enterprise — to connect more people to clinical trials, testing new means to screen, and prevent and treat cancer and other diseases. In its Clinical Trials Beyond Walls program, Mayo Clinic's research teams and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center have opened nine decentralized clinical trials in community settings and patients' homes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Community Outreach and Engagement Programs</h2>



<p>A significant driver of health disparities and poorer health outcomes in minority and underrepresented groups is the lack of access to care and engagement of underserved populations in clinical trials. In 2022, Mayo Clinic launched the Mayo Clinic Community Research Registry, which partners with faith-based organizations, fraternities, sororities, American Legion posts and others to educate communities about clinical trials and match interested individuals to trials at Mayo Clinic. More than 900 diverse community participants are currently enrolled in the registry.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is also seeking to create financial pathways and partnerships that will increase clinical access for patients within its communities. These initiatives will establish patient finance consulting and concierge services at each Mayo Clinic site to help patients navigate medical costs. Mayo Clinic also will look to support additional patient populations through expanded payer contracts.</p>

<p>“What is going on?” she thought.</p>



<p>She soon learned that her patient, MLB pitcher <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/09/06/all-star-pitcher-liam-hendriks-shares-how-he-closed-out-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liam Hendriks</a>, had just thanked her while accepting ESPN’s Jimmy V Award for Perseverance at the 2023 ESPYs, with more than 2.3 million people watching the broadcast that evening.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/07/Liam-1-x-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-370983" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/07/Liam-1-x-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/07/Liam-1-x-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/07/Liam-1-x-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/07/Liam-1-x-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/07/Liam-1-x-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Liam Hendriks</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>“She is one of the main reasons that I am up here tonight,” said Liam, who beat stage 4&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma</a>&nbsp;in the 2023 off-season.</p>



<p>A few hours later, when the program aired in her time zone in Arizona, Dr. Rosenthal, a lymphoma specialist at Mayo Clinic, tuned in.</p>



<p>“It was emotional for me to watch,” she says. “I was moved by his gratitude.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>Dr. Rosenthal has a history of helping athletes like Liam return to sports. As a former Division I gymnast who also received a cancer diagnosis at a young age, she understands how much they want to get back in the game.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Motivation and medicine</h2>



<p>During her childhood, Dr. Rosenthal was certain of two things: She loved gymnastics, and she was going to be a doctor.</p>



<p>Her plan was to earn a college gymnastics scholarship and then study to become an orthopedic surgeon. “Sports medicine doctors patched me together time and time again,” she says. “That’s what motivated me to go to medical school. I wanted to give back.”</p>



<p>She landed that college scholarship to Utah State University, where her rock-solid floor exercise and balance beam routines helped propel her team to a Big West Conference championship.</p>



<p>“It came with a lot of commitment,” recalls Dr. Rosenthal. “I had to work all of my prerequisites — my labs and everything you have to do to get into medical school — somehow around practice.”</p>



<p>The effort paid off. Dr. Rosenthal was accepted into medical school at Midwestern University in Glendale, Arizona. But two years in, she started to feel sick. She went to the emergency room suspecting the flu. Instead, she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer known as acute promyelocytic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leukemia</a>. The care she received over the following two-plus years inspired her to shift to oncology.</p>



<p>Dr. Rosenthal now specializes in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymphoma</a>, a blood cancer with many forms. But she still supports athletes. “For people under the age of 40, one of the most common types of cancer they get is lymphoma,” she says. Because these patients are young, they are more likely to still play sports. Dr. Rosenthal has treated high school, college and professional athletes in baseball, wrestling, water polo, soccer and more.</p>



<p>“My personal experience as a patient with cancer has influenced how I approach patient care,” she says. “My experience as a competitive athlete for my whole life definitely influences how I approach people who are active.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mental toughness</h2>



<p>Dr. Rosenthal shares her story with patients to inspire hope, especially in those who see her as an athlete like themselves.</p>



<p>“She’s been through something similar, she’s still here now, she’s happy, she’s still pushing forward and fighting that fight,” says Liam, who was so moved by his own care that he and his wife, Kristi, became benefactors of Mayo Clinic to support the clinic’s cancer efforts.</p>



<p>In her patients, Dr. Rosenthal sees athletes accustomed to working through discomfort without complaining, just as she did. While staying silent works in practice, Dr. Rosenthal needs patients to describe how they are feeling so she can give them the best possible care.</p>



<p>“It helps to know a little bit about the psyche and the mindset of a competitive athlete,” she says. “This is not a test to see how much you can tolerate without speaking up and saying, ‘I don’t feel good.’”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Back in the game</h2>



<p>When patients do feel well enough, Dr. Rosenthal encourages them to return to sports, even during treatment. “It helps with managing this experience if you are able to have something that feels regular,” she says.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean going all out right away. In many cases, lymphoma makes people feel tired rather than sick, so elite athletes might be tempted to push too hard through fatigue. She works with them to define limits that keep them active without setting back their treatment.</p>



<p>“We are keeping an eye on what is important to them,” she says. “And helping them get back to whatever that may be.”</p>



<p>Sometimes, Dr. Rosenthal says, what is important changes for a patient, like how she gave up her dream of becoming an orthopedic surgeon to pursue oncology.</p>



<p>And sometimes, that leads to the unexpected and maybe even a shoutout on national TV.</p>



<p>“I can’t imagine doing anything different at this point,” she says. “I am certain that this is my purpose.”</p>
