<p>When Justin Pomeroy, 23, struggled after a weight training session, he wasn’t sure if he was simply fatigued or experiencing a medical crisis. While lifting weights, one of his shoulders popped, followed by radiating pain.</p>



<p>Despite being fit for his active job as a Florida-based U.S. Coast Guard crewman, he continued to feel debilitating weakness, even when making the slightest of movements.</p>



<p>His condition worsened over the next few days to the point that he went to the emergency department, where he learned he had numerous blood clots. Justin later came to learn that his struggle after weight training was an early warning sign of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353988">thoracic outlet syndrome</a>, also known as TOS.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seeking answers</strong></h2>



<p>Justin saw a physician who ran tests that indicated a blood clotting disorder. It was quickly identified that he had a predisposition to clotting due to a genetic blood mutation.</p>



<p>"At the time, I wasn't aware of how serious the situation was," Justin says. "Honestly, the whole time while in the hospital, I was more concerned about what work I was missing."</p>



<p>The discovery of blood clots, which were treated with anticoagulant medication, was just the beginning of Justin's ordeal. The Coast Guardsman who had been in excellent health would spend the next 18 months trying to discover why he had grown so weak that he couldn’t perform his job without stopping to rest.</p>



<p>"My arm had swollen to such a size that it had become unmanageable," Justin says. "I was in aviation, and it created a situation where I was grounded and not flying anymore."</p>



<p>More testing and bloodwork revealed that, in addition to the clotting disorder, Justin had TOS, a rare disorder that involves compression of the nerves, arteries or veins in the lower neck and upper chest.</p>



<p>"I was medically retired from the Coast Guard," Justin says. "It was devastating because that was my career path, and it was something I really wanted to do."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A 'nagging feeling'</strong></h2>



<p>Although disappointed to leave a job he loved, Justin didn’t stop looking for answers.</p>



<p>"I'm the type of person who likes to leave no stone left unturned, and I had this nagging feeling that more could be done to improve my situation," he says.</p>



<p>His search for answers led him to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, wanting to see a team familiar with TOS diagnoses. Diagnosing thoracic outlet syndrome is complex because symptoms vary greatly and often can be indicators of other health problems — making it a difficult condition to pin down. Because there are multiple types of TOS, forming the correct diagnosis is key to successful treatment.</p>



<p>Justin got in to see Justin Yarbrough, nurse practitioner, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/farres-sam-m-d/bio-20055440">Dr. Sam Farres,</a> chief of the Vascular Surgery Division. Justin says as he told them his story, the care team listened closely, asking questions and sharing information. "There was just a wealth of knowledge," says Justin. "I thought, they're going to help me find some answers."</p>



<p>The Mayo team ran tests and imaging studies that other facilities didn't do, Justin says, revealing he actually had two types of thoracic outlet syndrome — neurogenic and vascular. After trying conservative treatment approaches with mixed success, Justin and his care team made the decision together to schedule him for a rib resection surgery in September 2023.</p>



<p>"They didn't want to rush in and push me to have surgery," he says. "They really wanted to make sure we were doing the right thing for my specific situation."</p>



<p>He was amazed to find that shortly after surgery, he could be active again. But it wasn't just the outcome of his surgery that impressed him. Justin was overwhelmed by the care team's proficiency and level of attention throughout his journey.</p>



<p>"It was mind-blowing to show up to a medical appointment and they are already in the room waiting for you," he says. "They tried to get a very nuanced understanding of my condition, and if I asked a question, it was answered."</p>



<p>Today, Justin says he's pain-free and has greater mobility, allowing him to get back to activities he loves, like fishing on the open water.</p>



<p>"That's great news for me," he says, "but not-so-great news for the fish."</p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. — With those New Year's resolutions six weeks behind us, some people may have reverted to less healthy ways of eating. Heart Month is a great time to remind yourself why a healthy diet is important for more than just your waistline.</p>



<p>"What you eat and drink affects your cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and if you have high cholesterol or triglyceride levels, your healthcare team may recommend following a cholesterol-lowering diet," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/ripu-singh-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripu Singh, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/cardiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> at Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mankato</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/waseca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waseca</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High cholesterol</a>&nbsp;could cause your heart arteries to harden, a condition called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atherosclerosis</a>, which&nbsp;could lead to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>. In addition, hardened arteries may allow a coating called plaque to build up and partially block your arteries. Blocked arteries can lead to low blood flow in the heart and chest pain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are triglycerides and cholesterol?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Triglycerides and cholesterol are types of lipids, or fats, which circulate in your blood. Triglycerides store unused calories and provide your body with energy. Cholesterol is used to build cells and certain hormones.</p>



<p>Cholesterol is made mainly by the liver but can also can enter your body in the foods you eat that contain animal fat. Foods that come from animals or contain animal fat include meat, egg yolks, lard and dairy products. The type and amount of fat you eat can influence how much cholesterol your body makes.</p>



<p>Your body makes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/triglycerides/art-20048186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triglycerides</a>&nbsp;from excess calories, regardless of the calorie source, such as fat, protein or carbohydrates. Triglycerides also are made from excess sugar and alcohol. High triglyceride levels are a risk factor for heart disease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lifestyle choices for improving your levels</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Your healthcare team may recommend some of these lifestyle changes to improve your blood cholesterol levels and lower your triglyceride level:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Eat a plant-based diet.</strong><br>Eat more high-fiber foods from plants. Choose 100% whole grains, whole fruits and vegetables.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Get to and stay at a healthy body weight.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Limit or avoid trans fats.</strong><br>Trans fats can raise blood cholesterol.</li>



<li><strong>Limit your intake of high-cholesterol foods.</strong><br>Reduce consumption of foods like egg yolks, organ meats, animal fat and high-fat dairy.</li>



<li><strong>Lower your total fat intake.</strong><br>All oils and fats are high in calories.</li>



<li><strong>Lower your saturated fat intake.</strong><br>Saturated fat can raise blood cholesterol.</li>



<li><strong>Replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats.</strong><br>Unsaturated fats can lower your blood cholesterol levels. Monounsaturated fats are preferred. Polyunsaturated fats are OK.</li>
</ul>



<p>"You can still enjoy foods you love, but you should prioritize a heart-healthy diet and eat less-healthy foods in moderation. Small changes can make a big impact in reducing your risk of heart disease," says Dr. Singh.</p>

<p>Triglycerides, the main kind of fat in your body, store extra energy from the food you eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's an energy source. It's like a little battery used for energy. But too many triglycerides can also cause heart disease," says Dr. Fernandes.</p>

<p>Triglycerides, the main kind of fat in your body, store extra energy from the food you eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's an energy source. It's like a little battery used for energy. But too many triglycerides can also cause heart disease," says Dr. Fernandes.</p>



<p>People who are overweight, in general, have high triglyceride levels and good cholesterol levels that are low.</p>



<p>"They may get heart disease not because their LDL is high, they get heart disease because the HDL is low and the triglycerides is high," he says.</p>



<p>And this is significant for people in their 30s and 40s.</p>



<p>So what can you do?&nbsp;Reducing simple carbohydrates, such as refined sugars and flours, can help lower your weight and improve your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. And you can back that up with exercise.</p>



<p>"One of the best ways to lower triglyceride levels is to exercise. Also, exercise helps to lose weight. And when you lose weight, your triglycerides improve a lot," says Dr. Fernandes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips to lower triglcyerides&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days.</li>



<li>Cut sugar and refined carbs.</li>



<li>Lose weight and focus on reducing calories.</li>



<li>Choose healthier fats like olive oil and fish that are rich in omega-3.</li>



<li>Limit alcohol, which can be high in calories and sugar.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<p>Medications, including&nbsp;statins,&nbsp;may be prescribed if lifestyle modifications don't help.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Harley’s fight to survive</strong></h2>



<p>Being together as a family has a deeper meaning for the Duffer family this Valentine’s day. In 2021, Harley suffered <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/clinical-trial-finds-cell-therapy-improves-quality-of-life-in-advanced-heart-failure/">heart failure</a> stemming from a rare genetic condition. He says doctors told him his only chance for survival was to get a heart transplant. </p>



<p>“I was basically on my deathbed,” says Harley. “They told me I had six months to live.” Doctors also told Harley the transplant would be the hardest thing he’s ever done in his whole life. </p>



<p>Harley says he had to fight to survive for his family.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The wait for a heart donor</strong></h2>



<p>Harley was placed in a medically induced coma at Mayo Clinic to minimize damage to his heart while waiting for a donor organ to become available. Each passing day took its toll on the family.</p>



<p>"There were several instances where the fear of him not making it through set in very heavy. And then you have a daughter at home saying ‘Where’s daddy? Where’s daddy?’ It was a lot to go through,” remembers Justine.</p>



<p>The Duffers got the call they were hoping for - a donor heart was available. Harley underwent a successful transplant and began his long road to recovery. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Heartfelt gratitude</strong></h2>



<p>After regaining his health, Harley got the chance to do something he never expected. He was given the opportunity to meet the family of his organ donor, Peyton Nurse.</p>



<p>Both families got together and listened to Peyton’s heart beating healthy and strong in Harley’s chest. </p>



<p>“I could not have asked for a better donor family. They are so caring and welcoming,” says Harley. “I understand they are going through a loss, but I want to be here for them. They are just the best kinds of people.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Remembering the life and legacy of Peyton Nurse </strong></h2>



<p>Peyton is remembered as a loving son, a brother, a friend to all, and a star student who always sought to help others in his community. He tragically lost his life in a car accident. His last wish was to be an organ donor. Peyton’s heart became the gift of life for Harley. </p>



<p>“We went to see Peyton’s resting place,” says Harley. “Such bravery and selflessness from a young man. I just want to say thank you to Peyton’s family, for your son’s bravery and the sacrifices he’s made.”</p>

<p>Harley and Justine are now back at home with their daughter, Libi, and their newborn baby girl. With their hearts full of love and gratitude, and the hope to carry on the legacy of their heart donor, they named their new baby girl, Peyton. </p>



<p>“We want her to know the importance of organ donation, and that’s why her daddy is still here, to raise his girls, and be here with us all together,” says Justine. </p>

<p>Carrying on the legacy of her son’s name means the world to his mom Lesley. “I can’t wait to hold baby Peyton in person and hold her in my arms,” shares Lesley. The name “Peyton” holds a special place in her heart because not only was it her son’s name, but a name that was handed down for several generations in her family.  </p>



<p>Lesley shared these two pictures as a Valentine’s Day message to serve as a reminder of the power of love, legacy and the gift of life. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Several countries observe Heart Month in February</em></h2>



<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Switching from an unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle to healthy eating and exercise can be daunting. In this expert alert, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cardenas-rosales-juan-c-m-d/bio-20526630?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Juan Cardenas Rosales, M.D.</a>, an internal medicine physician and medical director of the international medicine practice at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Jacksonville, Florida, shares small steps and one big one that can lead to a heart-healthy life.</p>



<p>Taking the first step can be difficult, whether trying to eat a nutritious diet, exercise more or both, Dr. Cardenas says. That is in part because people often set high expectations for themselves and try to reach them immediately, rather than approaching it as a process.</p>



<p>"It is better to make these changes little by little, and stay consistent, than to make a sudden change that is difficult to maintain," Dr. Cardenas explains. "For example, don't start exercising 30 minutes a day, five times a week, but start with 10 minutes every third day. Also, adjust your diet, and each day lower your sugar consumption a little, your fat consumption, your salt, and so on, little by little. Start with small steps but keep moving forward."</p>



<p>Dr. Cardenas recommends gradually substituting healthier choices into your diet, such as fish, chicken, fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains.</p>



<p>"Drinking a lot of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water</a> is also important, at least 2 liters of water a day, and staying away from processed foods that are very high in certain types of harmful fats like trans fats," Dr. Cardenas says.</p>



<p>One of the hardest moves to make can be skipping favorite foods that are now known to be unhealthy but have been part of family meals for generations, he adds.</p>



<p>"Many times, in our culture, our tradition, this type of diet has been followed for many years, and it is what we were often taught by our relatives, our grandmother, our parents. But many times, that does not mean that it is healthy for us," Dr. Cardenas says. "If we know that it is something that is harmful to our health, we should always try to choose the healthy option."</p>



<p>Working toward adequate sleep — at least seven hours — is also important for heart health. It reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and serious conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol, that are also risk factors for heart disease, Dr. Cardenas says.</p>



<p>"By having a good sleep, we also allow our body to recover and to be ready to continue the next day," he explains. "It has also been shown that many times, not sleeping well can lead to chronic stress."</p>



<p>There is one big change that Dr. Cardenas recommends making immediately: Stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke, exposure to other people's smoke.</p>



<p>"The moment one stops smoking, the risk of cardiovascular disease decreases," he says. "Research has shown that after one year of completing quitting smoking, the cardiovascular risk falls to half that of a person who smokes."</p>



<p>Before starting an exercise plan, it is a good idea to talk with your healthcare team to ensure a safe approach, Dr. Cardenas advises. It is also a good practice to schedule annual checkups so your healthcare team can screen for heart disease and risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol, he adds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What may appear as normal symptoms during pregnancy may overlap with red flags for heart failure.</p>



<p>"(Symptoms can include) lower extremity swelling, shortness of breath with walking short distances or shortness of breath when laying in the bed flat on your back at night," says Dr. Adedinsewo.</p>



<p>Delays in diagnosis can be deadly. And some who are pregnant have an even greater risk of developing heart failure.</p>



<p>"There is a unique form of heart failure that occurs during pregnancy and shortly after having a baby called peripartum <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiomyopathy</a>," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "Black women have up to a sixteenfold risk of developing this condition, compared to white women."</p>



<p>Eating a healthy diet, exercising, getting enough sleep and not smoking can lower risks. Dr. Adedinsewo recommends attending regular appointments with your healthcare team and checking blood glucose and blood lipids.</p>



<p>"If we are able to test and evaluate a tool that can use something as simple as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983?_ga=2.204175184.1519000234.1596213841-659235982.1596213841?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EKG</a> to identify a woman who's pregnant and at high risk of having heart failure, we can initiate appropriate therapies and reduce the risk of dying during this time period," she says.</p>

<p>When you think about exercise, sweating through a cycling class, adding up miles from a brisk walk or pumping iron in the weight room may come to mind. But there's a different form of exercise that uses something besides movement to give you a workout. It's&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/isometric-exercises/faq-20058186" target="_blank">isometric exercise</a>, which is gaining attention for its role in helping lower and control your blood pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is isometric exercise?</h2>



<p>Isometric exercise focuses on tightening or contracting a specific muscle or group of muscles. The targeted muscles don't noticeably change in length, and the joints involved don't move. The exercise is done in a static position and relies on your body's weight to help maintain strength and stabilize your joints and core.</p>



<p>Because isometric exercise doesn't involve movement or full range of motion and targets specific muscles, it can improve strength and stability for people recovering from an injury or those with arthritis.</p>



<p>One misconception about isometric exercise is that it involves straining and holding your breath, which can raise your blood pressure. To hold an isometric or static exercise, you need to concentrate on slowly breathing in and out.</p>



<p>New research has revealed that isometric exercise can be an effective tool for preventing or lowering high blood pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is blood pressure important?</h2>



<p>High blood pressure is harmful because it makes the heart work harder and less efficiently. For a quick review of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/about.htm" target="_blank">blood pressure</a>, there are two key numbers when&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/measure.htm" target="_blank">measuring your blood pressure</a>: systolic and diastolic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define these as:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Systolic blood pressure</strong><br>Measures the maximum pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts and relaxes.</li>



<li><strong>Diastolic blood pressure</strong><br>Measures the arterial pressure when the heart rests between beats.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/know-your-heart-health-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Healthy blood pressure</a> is less than 120/80 mm Hg.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the new research findings about exercise and blood pressure?</h2>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/20/1317" target="_blank">large study</a>&nbsp;published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers examined the recommendations for exercise to help lower blood pressure, which relied on older research that stressed aerobic or cardio exercises like cycling or running. The study also looked at the effects on blood pressure from high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, and isometric exercise.</p>



<p>The authors defined healthy resting blood pressure as below 130/85 mm Hg and high blood pressure as 140/90 mm Hg.</p>



<p>The study authors reviewed 270 trials with 15,827 participants between 1990 and 2023, and compared the results for isometric, HIIT, aerobic exercise, dynamic resistance training and a combination of the last two forms of exercise. Their findings were that isometric exercise led to the most significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can you build isometric exercise into your workout?</h2>



<p>Isometric exercise is an excellent addition to your <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/cardiology/prevention-and-self-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular and strength training routines</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Wall sits and planks are two of the best isometric exercises for lowering blood pressure. Here's how to do them:</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wall sit</strong></h4>



<p>Stand with your back toward a wall. Step out about 2 feet from the wall. Place your feet firmly on the ground and shoulder-width apart. Slide your back down the wall while keeping your abdominal muscles tight and bending your legs until they're at 90 degrees or a right angle. It's like sitting in a chair without the chair. Check that your knees are straight above your ankles.</p>



<p>This exercise focuses on your glutes, or buttock, muscles and quadriceps, or thigh, muscles, as well as your abdominal or core muscles.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Planks</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wall plank</strong><br>Stand facing a wall. Place your elbows and forearms on the wall. Take a step back, tuck in your bottom, and tighten your abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button into your spine. Hold for 20 seconds.</li>



<li><strong>Floor plank on knees</strong><br>Lie on your stomach and prop yourself up slightly on your forearms. Using your knees and forearms, lift your hips off the floor to about the same height as your shoulders. Hold this position, focusing on using your core muscles, for 20 seconds. To progress to a harder version, press your toes into the floor, then lift your knees off the floor and squeeze your glutes and core to create a plank that involves full-body tension. Think about pulling your belly button into your spine.</li>
</ul>



<p>Planks focus on your back, shoulders and abdominal muscles.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">With both exercises:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Remember to breathe slowly and regularly to give your muscles the oxygen they need.</li>



<li>Start by holding the position for 20 seconds. Work your way up to holding the position for two minutes. Strive for doing four sets, with a few minutes between each set, three times a week.</li>
</ul>

<p>Millions of football fans will be gathering to cheer on their favorite team during Sunday's big game. And with the excitement around the highly anticipated sporting event comes some advice about staying heart safe as a spectator.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/reddy-satyajit-t-m-d/bio-20535387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Satyajit Reddy</a>, a Mayo Clinic sports cardiologist, says that while those on the field certainly have some risk from a medical perspective, some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014628062030219X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a>&nbsp;indicate that fans watching the big game may have an increased risk of heart emergencies.</p>



<p>"The studies suggest that there is an increased incidence of cardiac events, namely,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrhythmias</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attacks</a>, during these major sporting events, especially in sports like soccer and American football. And even more interesting is that these rates of cardiac events go up the more dramatic the game is," says Dr. Reddy.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/QOZGs8hK6-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: Dr. Satyajit Reddy talk about heart safety during sporting events</a></strong></p>

<p>For instance, the closer the game is in the final moments, the incidence of cardiac events increase.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risk factors</h3>



<p>Those at most risk for experiencing a cardiac event during the game are people who have the traditional risk factors for heart disease or a preexisting history of heart disease.</p>



<p>"They have risk factors for heart disease — things like high blood pressure, diabetes or pre-diabetes, high cholesterol — maybe they don't see a primary physician regularly," he says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Heart safety tips</h3>



<p>A sports watch party can be a celebration of excess and a combination of too much alcohol, tobacco, and salty, greasy foods. Combined with emotional stress, these factors can lead to condition that is also seen around the holidays known as <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-recognizing-holiday-heart-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holiday heart </a>— where an irregular heartbeat, known as <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-managing-atrial-fibrillation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a>, can arise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are three tips to enjoy the big game and stay heart-healthy:</p>



<ul>
<li>Avoid tobacco use.</li>



<li>Limit alcohol.</li>



<li>Eat healthfully.</li>
</ul>



<p>"There are salty, greasy and sugary foods, which can certainly add up over three hours. And if you have high blood pressure, if you have these cardiac risk factors, that can overwhelm your heart and cause cardiac issues," says Dr. Reddy.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Be mindful of stress.</h3>



<p>"If you're watching the game, and you notice yourself getting anxious or stressed out, having a relaxation technique or ways to manage your anxiety or stress is important," he says. "Also, with the prevalence of sports betting nowadays, to avoid betting because that just adds another layer of stress."</p>



<p>Dr. Reddy says to celebrate in good health and practice heart safety.</p>



<p>"Enjoy the game, but do it responsibly," he adds.</p>



<p>If you or someone you are with is experiencing symptoms of a cardiac event, call 911 immediately.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Heart attack symptoms</h3>



<p>Common symptoms may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chest pain that may feel like pressure, tightness, pain, squeezing or aching.</li>



<li>Pain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth or sometimes the upper belly.</li>



<li>Cold sweat.</li>



<li>Fatigue.</li>



<li>Heartburn or indigestion.</li>



<li>Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness.</li>



<li>Nausea.</li>



<li>Shortness of breath.</li>
</ul>



<p>Symptoms of a heart attack may be different for men and women.&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-womens-heart-attack-symptoms-vary-2/">Women</a> may have atypical symptoms, such as brief or sharp pain felt in the neck, arm or back.</p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. — Sweating, nausea, dizziness and unusual fatigue may not sound like typical <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106">heart attack</a> symptoms. However, they are common for women and may occur more often when resting or asleep.<br><br>Unlike with men, pain, pressure or discomfort in the chest are not always severe or even the most prominent heart attack symptom in women. That’s why women need to understand their unique symptoms while also working to reduce their risk of heart disease.</p>



<p>"It's important to first recognize the risk factors of developing heart disease and then work to curb behaviors that might exacerbate that risk," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/chatura-alur-md-mph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chatura Alur, M.D.,</a> family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato. "Some factors play a more significant role in the development of heart disease in women than what are considered the tradition risks, such as high cholesterol, obesity and high blood pressure."</p>



<p>Women should also control these risk factors to help prevent heart disease:<br></p>



<ul>
<li>Diabetes</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/tips-to-keep-stress-from-hurting-your-heart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental stress</a> and depression</li>



<li>Smoking</li>



<li>Sedentary lifestyle<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Certain conditions, including menopause, broken heart syndrome and pregnancy complications also may increase a woman's risk for heart disease.</p>



<p>"Women of all ages should take heart disease seriously," says Dr. Alur. "Many women tend to downplay their symptoms and not seek care until heart damage has already occurred and an emergency room visit becomes necessary. We want women to understand the importance of listening to their bodies, understanding what feels normal to them, and seeking care before symptoms become severe."</p>



<p>Heart Month is a great time to brush up on knowledge about heart disease in women. Here are a few facts you may not have known.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Heart disease affects women of all ages.&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The combination of birth control pills and smoking boosts heart disease risks by 20% in young women, according to the American Heart Association. Risk also increases as women age. Overeating and leading a sedentary lifestyle are factors that lead to blocked arteries over time. Don't let your age lull you into a false sense of security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Heart disease isn't all about self-care.</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Unfortunately, all the salads and yoga in the world can't eliminate your heart disease risk. Family history often plays a factor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Knowing your heart health numbers can help.</strong></h2>



<p>The American Heart Association recommends you start getting your cholesterol checked at age 20, or earlier if your family has a history of heart disease. It’s also important to have your blood pressure checked regularly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Women can have heart attacks without previous symptoms.&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>According to the American Heart Association, 64% of women who die suddenly of coronary heart disease had no previous symptoms.</p>



<p>When women experience&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-disease/art-20046167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms</a> of a heart attack, those signs often are misinterpreted. Women's symptoms often are vague — shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and back or jaw pain. Other women experience dizziness, lightheadedness, pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, and extreme fatigue. If something feels off or not right, don't wait to seek medical attention.</p>

<p>A new Mayo Clinic systematic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074152142301306X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review</a> has shed light on genetically inherited aortic disorders, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for those who have inherited cardiovascular risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers identified that a procedure known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/multimedia/endovascular-repair-for-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/img-20123853#:~:text=In%20endovascular%20thoracic%20aortic%20aneurysm,with%20small%20hooks%20or%20pins." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR)</a> provided a high survival rate for young adult patients with type B <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-dissection/symptoms-causes/syc-20369496" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aortic dissections</a>. Type B aortic dissections consist of a tear in the descending part of the aorta that may extend into the abdominal aorta.</p>



<p>"We studied type B aortic dissections and aortic aneurysms and their management, especially in people born with genetic complications or syndromes," says Mohammed M. Firwana, M.B.B.S., research fellow and lead author of the study.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Firwana_Mohammed_21674922_202003050932-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-381417" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Firwana_Mohammed_21674922_202003050932-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Firwana_Mohammed_21674922_202003050932.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mohammed M. Firwana, M.B.B.S., research fellow and lead author of the study.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Notably, in over one-third of patients, genetic testing identified new aortic events within 15&nbsp;years. Patients with genetic risk factors exhibited a 62% rate of recurring aortic events, compared with 11% in patients without genetic risk factors, signifying the potential for more severe complications in the presence of such disorders.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana adds that some of the findings varied by race, underlining the critical need for awareness and early treatment across all demographics.</p>



<p>"One of the more interesting findings was that Black patients with genetic risk factors had lower mortality than White patients, and that's mostly explained by how they presented at a younger age and their condition was likely managed earlier," says Dr. Firwana.<br><br>Researchers underscore that aortic aneurysms, dissections, and ruptures are thought to be the cause of 43,000 to 47,000 fatalities in the U.S. each year and that approximately 20% of thoracic aortic aneurysms are related to the genetic condition, also known as heritable thoracic aortic disease. These conditions are often silent but can lead to aortic dissection or rupture with often fatal outcomes.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana emphasizes that identifying certain genetic mutations provides important knowledge and understanding of genetically inherited aortic disorders in patients.</p>



<p>He adds that there are multiple risk factors that can lead to a higher likelihood of aortic disorders, for example, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/marfan-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marfan syndrome</a>, a connective tissue disease, that affects one in 5,000 people in the U.S.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana notes that another condition that can leave people prone to aortic issues is hypertension.</p>



<p>"Hypertension stands out as an important risk factor," says Dr. Firwana.</p>



<p>"It contributes to the weakening of the walls of the aorta over time, making them more susceptible to tearing or dissection."</p>

<p>Researchers note that the systematic review is being used to help support guideline development&nbsp;when managing genetically inherited aortic disorders in patients and that more research is needed to identify the role of Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair in patients with&nbsp;connective tissue disease.</p>



<p>Dr. Firwana emphasizes that quitting smoking, managing hypertension, and addressing diabetes are crucial preventive strategies for those with these genetic predispositions.</p>



<p>"A panel of experts from the Society for Vascular Surgery will use this systematic review to develop a clinical practice guideline that aims to help patients make decisions about their care," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/murad-m-hassan-m-d/bio-00094157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M. Hassan Murad, M.D.,</a> senior author of the study. "Further research on this topic can guide tailored interventions for improved patient outcomes."</p>
