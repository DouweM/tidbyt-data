<p>Mayo Clinic researchers will jump four hurdles to apply <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy)</a> to solid tumors in thyroid cancer. This regenerative immunotherapy has shown promising results in blood cancers, and new research is focused on using this treatment on more types of malignancies.</p>



<p>"CAR-T cell therapy is unlike other therapeutics," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a hematologist and cancer researcher. "Other therapies may slow down cancer. CAR-T cell therapy has shown great promise in stopping B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. Some of <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/car-t-cell-therapy-restores-hope-for-leukemia-patient/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my patients</a> have gone into complete remission that has lasted for years after just one treatment."</p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy harnesses the power of the body's immune system to kill tumors. T cells are taken from a patient, then genetically modified and returned to the body to act as guardians against cancer.</p>



<p>In a team science approach, Dr. Kenderian and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/copland-john-a-iii-ph-d/bio-00028205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Copland III, Ph.D.</a>, are collaborating as principal investigators on research to develop CAR-T technology for solid tumors in thyroid cancer. However, to do so they must address four challenges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. There are no clear targets in solid tumors</strong></h2>



<p>CAR-T cells are engineered to target specific proteins and antigens that are on the surface of cancer cells. Antigens are substances that activate the body's immune system. CARs are genetically programmed to trigger an immune response and destroy cancer cells.</p>



<p>"However, there are few clear targets on solid tumors like we have in liquid tumors," says Dr. Kenderian. "For CAR-T cell therapy to be successful, the first thing that we need to do is identify a protein to target that is unique to cancer cells that is not also expressed on normal tissue."</p>



<p>The teams of Dr. Kenderian and Dr. Copland believe they have identified such a target in the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) which is uniquely found on thyroid cancer cells in the thyroid gland. They are engineering THSR targeting into CAR-T cell therapy for thyroid cancer. This is known as TSHR CAR-T.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. One treatment type doesn't fit all solid tumors</strong></h2>



<p>Solid cancers are comprised of many cell subsets. As a result, a tumor may have genetic mutations in some cells that aren't present in others. This is known as tumor heterogeneity, and it makes it difficult to treat these cancers with a single therapy.</p>



<p>"To overcome the tumor heterogeneity, we are using a strategy to combine TSHR CAR-T cell therapy with small molecules to block cancer cells from growing and metastasizing," says Dr. Copland. "We are studying whether loading CAR-T cells with this synthetic receptor in combination will trigger a cancer fighting response."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Solid tumors may be resistant to CAR-T cell therapy</strong></h2>



<p>Unlike blood cancers, solid tumors exist in a microenvironment that suppresses the immune system. In addition, dense clusters of malignant cells may create a barrier that blocks the CARs from bringing their cancer fighting mechanisms into cells.</p>



<p>"One strategy for overcoming this challenge is to target cells that are contributing to tumor aggressiveness," says Dr. Copland. "Another is to develop technology known as dual CARs that recognize two different targets. We are studying whether that will overcome tumor resistance."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Treating solid tumors may cause side effects</strong></h2>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy could mistakenly attack nearby healthy tissue, triggering what's known as "off-target effects." The result might be adverse side effects that are hard for the patient to tolerate. TSHR is a unique target that is expressed only on thyroid cancer cells and not on normal tissues, which minimizes the risk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On-site biomanufacturing is a bridge to clinical trials</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Kenderian and Dr. Copland are refining the TSHR CAR-T cell technology in the lab and in preclinical models. Biomanufacturing at Mayo Clinic will provide a bridge to accelerate this technology from the lab to early-stage clinical trials.</p>



<p>The process development team within Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> now is conducting test runs and establishing standard operating procedures in preparation for biomanufacturing this technology at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"On-site biomanufacturing is critical to preserving the integrity of the cells during manufacturing," says Dr. Kenderian. "This is a very complex technology with many components that would make it difficult, if not impossible, to ship to an outside manufacturer."</p>



<p>Dr. Kenderian and Dr. Copland are driven by a passion to provide new therapies for patients who have few or no therapeutic options. Their goal is to advance CAR-T cell therapy for thyroid cancer to a first-in-human clinical trial by early 2025<em>.</em></p>

<p>"Pink eye, or the medical term is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pink-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20376355?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conjunctivitis</a>, typically is a red or pink, irritated eye that can present with other symptoms, like tearing of the eye, itchiness, and sometimes pain and discharge," says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>Pink eye is an inflammation of the transparent membrane that lines the eye and eyelid. It's most often caused by a virus, but bacterial infections and allergies can sometimes be the culprit.</p>



<p>"How we treat conjunctivitis depends on what causes it," says Dr. Ardon. "Most commonly, we're still dealing with viruses. So those will resolve on their own without intervention. Sometimes we do consider treating that with an antibiotic drop if it is bacterial in nature."</p>



<p>She says, like common colds and the flu, pink eye is contagious and taking certain precautions is key.</p>



<p>"Most patients may be at risk for contracting this if they touch someone who has the pink eye, rubs their eye, maybe touches their face, doesn't wash their hands consistently," says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>Because pink eye is most often viral, antibiotics usually won't help. Treatment is focused on symptom relief.</p>



<p>"They may find themselves to be a bit more comfortable if they use items such as a warm compress to alleviate some of their symptoms. And rest, again, can be really helpful," says Dr. Ardon.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In this Q&amp;A, Dr. Binnicker offers more context on the current influenza outbreak.</strong></h3>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What is the risk of bird flu transmitting to humans?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>A</strong>: Currently, the CDC is characterizing the risk to humans of this avian influenza outbreak as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/inhumans.htm">low</a>. So, if we're on a scale of 1 to 10, we're probably at a 1 or a 2. Now, the concern is that we're seeing not only millions of infections in commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks that humans frequently come into contact with, but we're also seeing higher rates of infection in mammals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>Q: How is avian influenza transmitted?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>A</strong>: The birds will transmit avian influenza through their own respiratory mucosal secretions, much like we think about with other respiratory viruses in humans, or through contaminated feces. So a bird can become infected through exposure to contaminated soil or feces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For humans, the transmission so far has been very rare; there have only been two documented cases of avian influenza in the U.S. since 2022, one in Colorado and most recently in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0401-avian-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What are the symptoms of infection?</strong></h3>



<p>Those individuals were infected by coming into very close contact with animals who had avian influenza. These individuals may have come in contact with a respiratory secretion from an infected bird or mammal, or a contaminated surface. It is possible for humans to inhale the virus, or to become infected through self-inoculation if they touch a contaminated surface and then introduce the virus into their eyes, nose or mouth.</p>



<p><strong>A</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wild, migratory birds often do not show symptoms of avian influenza infection. Wild birds are a reservoir for avian influenza viruses. In commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks, that's where we see more severe disease. Since 2022, there have been over 60 million commercial poultry or backyard bird flocks killed or culled because of avian influenza infection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In humans, avian influenza can present in a similar way to normal human influenza infection. As is the case with other respiratory viral infections, avian influenza in humans may cause a spectrum of illness, from mild disease to a severe lower respiratory tract infection. In this most recent case in Texas, the patient only experienced <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/home-remedies-coping-with-conjunctivitis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conjunctivitis</a>, which is redness and inflammation in the eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: Can bird flu be prevented?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>A</strong>: The key preventive measure is to avoid contact with a sick or dead animal, especially birds. If you own a backyard bird flock or work in a commercial poultry facility, and there are birds that are sick or have died, do not come in contact with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if it’s impossible to avoid contact, it's important to take necessary precautions, including wearing eye protection, an N95 mask and gloves. Those protective measures are going to help prevent an individual from coming into contact with avian influenza virus, either through inhalation of infected respiratory secretions or by self-inoculating the virus from a contaminated surface into the eyes, nose or mouth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Q: What should the public keep in mind?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Currently, the overall risk of widespread infection in humans is low. We know that this virus is transmitted efficiently among wild birds, and since 2022, it has resulted in millions of infections in commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks. We've also started to see infection in many types of mammals, but so far, infection in humans is rare.&nbsp;We need to approach this with a sense of preparedness. Now is the time to put tools in place in the event we see sustained, high rates of transmission in humans. These tools include testing, antivirals and vaccines, which can be rapidly deployed and hopefully prevent avian influenza from becoming a worldwide proble</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/study-documents-safety-improvements-from-stem-cell-therapy-after-spinal-cord-injury/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Study documents safety, improvements from stem cell therapy after spinal cord injury</a></h2>



<p>A recent Mayo Clinic study indicates that stem cells obtained from the fat tissue of patients are both safe and could enhance sensation and movement following traumatic spinal cord injuries. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential of cell therapy for people dealing with spinal cord injuries and paralysis, especially when options to enhance functionality are severely restricted.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-3-ways-to-prevent-head-and-neck-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: 3 ways to prevent head and neck cancer</a></h2>



<p>Throat cancer, often associated with HPV, is one of the fastest-growing cancers. According to Dr. Katharine Price, a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist, there are three strategies to lower your risk and potentially prevent head and neck cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-a-living-donor-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Minute: What is a living donor chain?</a></h2>



<p>A person is added to the national kidney transplant waiting list every 10 minutes. To increase the pool of organs available for transplant, living kidney donor chains are a promising solution. Dr. Shennen Mao, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon, explains how donor chains work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/untangling-the-threads-of-early-onset-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Untangling the threads of early onset dementia</a></h2>



<p>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) can be extremely debilitating, leading to changes in personality, behavior and language. Mayo Clinic researchers have focused on understanding how various forms of a protein linked to FTD can influence the risk and severity of the disease.</p>

<p>The typical <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/head-feels-heavy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">average adult head weighs</a> approximately 10-12 pounds. But did you know that bending it forward at a 45-degree angle to look at a cellphone or tablet can dramatically increase your chances to have "tech neck?" </p>



<p>"That's like having an 8-pound bowling ball as your head. Then you have 72 pounds at your elbow and 96 pounds on your shoulder," says Brian Langenhorst, industrial and ergonomics specialist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse</a>. "I probably see tech neck on a weekly basis at businesses, schools and industry."</p>



<p>Tech neck is any form of chronic neck or shoulder pain, soreness, or stiffness caused by poor posture while using technology such as phones or computers. Looking down at electronic devices causes the neck muscles to strain and the shoulders to slump forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"People will notice some musculoskeletal fatigue," explains Langenhorst. "They may notice pressure on nerve supply, which then can have some referred pain, and pressure on nerve supply within the neck that can have referred pain within the arms and hands."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over time, this position can deform your shoulder, chest and neck muscles and put pressure on your spine.</p>



<p>"You may have eight to 10 hours at work on a computer. Then you're home for two to four hours on a computer or on your phone. That's extremely fatiguing to your neck and body," says Langenhorst.</p>



<p>"With cellphones, we're having to bring them closer to maintain visual comfort," adds Langenhorst. "What I find all too often is many people don't move enough. They are staying in a static position for extremely long periods of time."</p>



<p>On average, people spend <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexplodingtopics.com%2Fblog%2Fsmartphone-usage-stats%23top-smartphone-stats&amp;data=05%7C02%7CThiesse.Ricky%40mayo.edu%7Ceaca780f18444ab3caec08dc3d5b3b50%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638452709238912081%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=FMEfqdLTtYFW0XtXUePj3IWNJhsS5QxeLY5ftqfA2Iw%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three hours and 15 minutes </a>on their phones each day. Individuals check their phones an average of 58 times each day. Almost half (46%) of Americans believe they spend an average of four to five hours on their smartphones each day. <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Ftech%2Fmobile%2Fwell-spend-nearly-a-decade-of-our-lives-staring-at-our-phones-study-says%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CThiesse.Ricky%40mayo.edu%7Ceaca780f18444ab3caec08dc3d5b3b50%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638452709238916924%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2BN5Z53qGAb74gS7MiM8vDm3JF0iacSTcDZ96Hjnxi04%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A 2020 study</a> discovered that Americans will spend nearly nine years of their life using their phone.</p>



<p>"Static positioning is actually more work and more effort than dynamic movement," offers Langenhorst.&nbsp;"Your body is going to ask you do you want to have visual comfort or postural comfort. The key here is that vision always wins because we change our posture to accommodate vision."</p>



<p>Tech neck also can cause issues beyond your neck and shoulders. Extra spinal pressure in your neck can lead to lower back pain,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/headache/basics/definition/sym-20050800">headaches</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinichealthsystem.org%2Fspinecenterlacrosse%2F%3Fcustomer_id%3D750-851-3615%26mc_id%3Dgoogle%26campaign%3D19807845764%26geo%3D9019294%26kw%3Dherniated%2520disc%2520mayo%2520clinic%26ad%3D650977573423%26network%3Dg%26sitetarget%3D%26adgroup%3D148296490473%26extension%3D%26target%3Dkwd-336143140249%26matchtype%3Dp%26device%3Dc%26account%3D7508513615%26invsrc%3Dmchsswwi%26placementsite%3Dmchs%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAopuvBhBCEiwAm8jaMbhZAoa1frmxjvvUF7Op_T-VV0y5ShxPLDTb3euPRblZZb3x6c9FNBoCXlcQAvD_BwE&amp;data=05%7C02%7CThiesse.Ricky%40mayo.edu%7Ceaca780f18444ab3caec08dc3d5b3b50%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638452709238921665%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=OFiMcIxhTjBIB4BMTCo0v%2BEFj5CIL9DGDS45kDtBr%2Fo%3D&amp;reserved=0">herniated disks</a>&nbsp;(slipped or bulging disks).&nbsp;Altered neck muscles and poor posture also can strain jaw joints and muscles, creating temporomandibular joint pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Just think about kids and when they're home. They have their tablet, desktop or phone at home for homework. Just look at their posture and see what their posture looks like. Are they in a pretty good position? If they're not, they're probably in all sorts of kind of goofy postures," says Langenhorst. "They can probably get away with it while they're a little bit younger and invincible. But soon, even in their early 20s,&nbsp;&nbsp;muscle fatigue is going to kick in, and we're going to notice some more strain and sprain. Make sure they're doing some consistent stretching and movement that we build into our day."&nbsp;</p>



<p>One tip Langenhorst also recommends is placing pillows on your lap allowing your forearms to be supported on those pillows. He also suggests trying to hold the phone at more of an upright, angled position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's not great, but it's better than not being supported," Langenhorst shares. "As we age, the disks of our spine become narrowed, we start to lose some of the cushiness that's there. That can generate a little bit more pressure on the nerve roots that come out of the level of the neck. As you get older, meaning 45 and older, those disk spaces become narrower. That can put pressure on your nerves within your neck. Some people could notice a level of fatigue and discomfort, then generating into pain. Pain can then generate into disability."</p>

<ul>
<li>Place your screen 20-30 inches away from your eyes (about an arm's length). &nbsp;</li>



<li>Use a computer monitor or laptop stand to help elevate your screen to the right level (or stack some books).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Sit with your head, hips and spine stacked. "My eye height should be about 1/2 inch to 1½ inches higher than the screen because we have a 15-degree eye gaze. When I'm looking straight ahead, my neck muscles and my back muscles and my upper shoulder muscles get a chance to relax. This prevents putting uneven pressures on the nerve supply or the muscle groups," adds Langenhorst.</li>



<li>Keep your wrists straight and your elbows bent at about 90-degree angles.</li>



<li>Keep your knees in line with your hips and your feet flat on the floor.</li>
</ul>



<p>"The greatest challenge is we're not working or staying in a neutral or straight posture. I want to be able to have my head in an upright position, ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips," he says.</p>



<p>Neck pain is the fourth leading cause of disability, with an annual prevalence rate exceeding 30%. Most episodes of acute neck pain will resolve with or without treatment, but nearly 50% of people will continue to experience some degree of pain or frequent occurrences.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A recent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> study suggests that active workstations incorporating a walking pad, bike, stepper and/or standing desk are successful strategies for reducing sedentary time and improving mental cognition at work without reducing job performance. Extended sedentary behavior, whether at work or home, increases a person's risk of preventable <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351916?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic diseases</a>.</p>



<p>"Our findings suggest that it is feasible to blend movement with office work that previously would have been done during long periods of sitting. Active workstations may offer a way to potentially improve cognitive performance and overall health, simply by moving at work," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-00028001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</a>, a preventive cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study.</p>



<p>The research involved 44 participants in a randomized clinical trial where four office settings were evaluated over four consecutive days at Mayo Clinic's Dan Abraham Healthy Living Center. Study findings are published in the <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.031228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Heart Association</a>. The settings included a stationary or sitting station on the first day, followed by three active workstations (standing, walking or using a stepper) in a randomized order. Researchers analyzed participants' neurocognitive function based on 11 assessments that evaluated reasoning, short-term memory and concentration. Fine motor skills were assessed through an online typing speed test and other tests. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When participants used the active workstations, their brain function either improved or stayed the same, and their typing speed slowed down only a bit. However, the accuracy of their typing was not affected.&nbsp;The study revealed improved reasoning scores when standing, stepping and walking as compared with sitting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Being sedentary is the new smoking when it comes to your cardiovascular health, and office workers may spend a large part of their eight-hour workday sitting at a computer screen and keyboard. These findings indicate that there are more ways to do that work while remaining productive and mentally sharp. We would do well to consider an active workstation in the prescription for prevention and treatment of conditions like obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>

<p>On April 8, a solar eclipse — when the moon blocks the sun — will be visible in North America as the sun crosses Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. A total eclipse will occur in certain locations in the U.S., and a partial eclipse will be visible in other areas of the country, including Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa. While the eclipse is a momentous occasion, it's something eye experts say you need to enjoy safely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Eye safety during the eclipse</h2>



<p>Looking into any type of eclipse — partial or total — poses severe risks to your eyes. You could permanently damage your retina or even cause blindness. It's not safe to look directly at the sun without specialized protective eyewear.</p>



<p>If you plan to take part in the solar viewing, you need to use solar eclipse glasses or a solar viewer to be completely safe. Solar viewers or glasses labeled as ISO 12312-2 compliant reduce the sunlight to a safe level for viewing.</p>



<p>Regular sunglasses and homemade solar filters are not safe for use. Regular sunglasses don't provide adequate eye protection like eclipse glasses, no matter how dark the sunglasses are.</p>



<p>The eclipse can be viewed directly without eye protection only when the sun is entirely covered by the moon, which is called totality. During this period, you'll no longer be able to see any part of the sun through your eclipse glasses or solar viewer.</p>



<p>It's crucial to immediately put on your eclipse glasses or use the solar viewer again as soon as the sun's first light is visible behind the moon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Safety tips for eclipse viewing</h2>



<p>Eclipse viewers should follow these safety tips from the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.aao.org/" target="_blank">American Academy of Ophthalmology</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aas.org/" target="_blank">American Astronomical Society</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Always read and follow all directions that come with the solar filter or eclipse glasses.</li>



<li>Carefully look at your solar filter or eclipse glasses before using them. If you see any scratches, tears or damage, don't use them.</li>



<li>Before looking up at the bright sun, stand still and cover your eyes with your eclipse glasses or solar viewer. After glancing at the sun, turn away and remove your filter — don't remove it while looking at the sun.</li>



<li>Help children use handheld solar viewers and eclipse glasses correctly.</li>



<li>Never look at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed sun through an unfiltered camera, telescope, binoculars or similar devices. This is important even if you're wearing eclipse glasses or holding a solar viewer at the same time. The intense solar rays coming through these devices will damage the solar filter and your eyes.</li>



<li>Talk with an expert astronomer if you want to use a special solar filter with a camera, a telescope, binoculars or any other optical device.</li>
</ul>



<p>Have fun watching the solar eclipse, but be sure your eyes are properly protected.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic scientists have developed an immunotherapy strategy that potentially lays the groundwork for treating a spectrum of autoimmune diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new technique, detailed in a preclinical study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01195-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Biomedical Engineering</a>, involves combining chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), resulting in engineered stem cells known as CAR-MSCs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The combination approach centers on mesenchymal stromal cells, which are found in various tissues in the body, including bone marrow, fat tissue and umbilical cord blood. These cells have the unique ability to transform into several specific types of cells such as bone cells, cartilage cells and fat cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mesenchymal stromal cells are known for calming down the immune system, controlling inflammation and promoting immune tolerance to prevent the body's own tissues from being attacked.</p>



<p>Within this CAR-MSCs framework, mesenchymal stromal cells are engineered with chimeric antigen receptors, which are molecular tools engineered to recognize specific disease-related markers. </p>



<p>Chimeric antigen receptors have three crucial functions: 1) Target and attach to specific markers on diseased cells. 2) Act as an anchor to ensure the chimeric antigen receptors stay connected to the target. 3) Initiate signaling to activate a robust immune response.</p>



<p>While mesenchymal stromal cells have been extensively studied in isolation in autoimmune contexts, their efficacy has fallen short. The combined CAR-MSC therapeutic strategy tackles two key challenges: Mesenchymal stromal cells by themselves have difficulty calming down the strong immune reactions in autoimmune conditions, and they struggle to travel to and attach to the areas of inflammation.</p>



<p>Engineering mesenchymal stromal cells with chimeric antigen receptors shows potential in enhancing their ability to target specific cells or markers and improve their therapeutic impact.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How CAR-MSCs target inflammation</strong></h3>



<p>For the study, Dr. Kenderian and his team developed CAR-MSCs to specifically target a protein linked to a condition called graft-versus-host disease, as well as inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. </p>



<p>Graft-versus-host disease occurs when cells from a donor attack the tissues of the person receiving them, typically following a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.</p>



<p>In mouse models, upon stimulation by the specific protein they were designed to target, CAR-MSCs showed improved ability to go to the inflamed area, have better control of inflammation and improve outcomes and survival. This was mediated by a change in the genetic signature of CAR-MSCs, the proteins they released and receptor expression.</p>



<p>Dr. Kenderian emphasizes that these preliminary findings set the stage for future applications of this technology, paving the way to enhance the therapy's versatility to address various diseases across the autoimmune spectrum.</p>



<p>This study builds upon a series of previously published studies on CAR-T therapy led by Dr. Kenderian and his collaborators at Mayo Clinic's<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Center for Individualized Medicine</a>,<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about"> Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> and the<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. Dr. Kenderian is also investigating ways to make CAR-T cell therapy more accessible to patients through on-site biomanufacturing at Mayo Clinic's campuses in Rochester, Minnesota and Jacksonville, Florida.</p>

<p>March is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eatright.org/national-nutrition-month-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Nutrition Month</a>, which makes this a good time to learn about your nutritional needs during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.</p>



<p>During pregnancy, the basic principles of healthy eating remain the same — get plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fats. However, a few nutrients in a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy-nutrition/art-20045082 ?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pregnancy diet</a> deserve special attention.</p>



<p>The nutrients to pay special attention to while you're pregnant include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Calcium</strong><br>You and your baby need calcium for strong bones and teeth. Calcium also supports healthy functioning of the circulatory, muscular and nervous systems. Dairy products are the best absorbed sources of calcium. Nondairy sources include broccoli and kale. Many fruit juices and breakfast cereals are fortified with calcium, too.</li>



<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong><br>Vitamin D works with calcium to help build your baby's bones and teeth. Fatty fish, such as salmon, is a great source of vitamin D. Other options include fortified milk and orange juice.</li>



<li><strong>Protein</strong><br>Protein is crucial for your baby's growth throughout pregnancy. Lean meat, poultry, seafood and eggs are great sources of protein. Other options include beans, nuts, seeds and soy products.</li>



<li><strong>Iron</strong><br>The body uses iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. During pregnancy, you need double the amount of iron that nonpregnant women need. Your body needs this iron to make more blood to supply oxygen to your baby. Lean red meat, poultry and fish are good sources of iron. Other options include iron-fortified breakfast cereals, beans and vegetables.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you're breastfeeding, you're giving your baby nutrients that will promote growth and health. What about your nutritional needs, though? Here are some tips about out <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/in-depth/breastfeeding-nutrition/art-20046912 ?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what foods and drinks are best for you</a> — and how your diet might affect your breast milk and your baby.</p>



<ul>
<li>First, you'll need an additional 330–400 calories a day to give you the energy and nutrition to produce milk. To get these extra calories, opt for nutrient-rich choices, such as a slice of whole-grain bread with a tablespoon of peanut butter, a medium banana or apple, and 8 ounces of yogurt.</li>



<li>To make sure you get enough fluids, drink when you are thirsty, and drink more if your urine appears dark yellow. You might drink a glass of water or another beverage every time you breastfeed.</li>



<li>Focus on making healthy choices to help fuel your milk production. Opt for protein-rich foods, such as lean meat, eggs, dairy, beans, lentils and seafood low in mercury. Choose a variety of whole grains, as well as fruits and vegetables.</li>



<li>Eating a variety of foods while breastfeeding will change the flavor of your breast milk. This will expose your baby to different tastes, which might help him or her more easily accept solid foods down the road.</li>



<li>Certain foods and drinks that deserve caution while you're breastfeeding include alcohol, caffeine and seafood.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding your nutritional needs or those of your baby, talk with your health care professionals for guidance specific to your situation.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-wash-your-pets-food-and-water-bowls-to-prevent-salmonella/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Wash your pet’s food and water bowls to prevent salmonella</a></h2>
