<p>Mayo Clinic’s three largest campuses completed a joint submission to the Human Rights Campaign’s 2024 Health Equality Index (HEI) survey and achieved the highest score possible. Together, the Arizona, Florida, and Rochester campuses were collectively recognized as Leaders in LGBTQ+ Healthcare. <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/human-rights-campaign-foundations-2024-healthcare-equality-index-reveals-policy-progress-and-gaps-for-lgbtq-inclusion-in-healthcare-facilities-nationwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Of the more than 1000 hospitals participating, only 384 achieved the top score and the leader designation.</a></p>



<p>Forming an enterprise HEI survey workgroup, LGBTI+ Mayo Employee Resource Group (MERG) leaders from each site and Mayo Clinic’s Office of Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity worked together for six months to ensure more than 100 survey questions were accurately answered on the 2024 HEI.</p>

<p>The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) is the largest civil rights organization in the U.S. working to achieve equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people. HRC uses its biennial HEI survey to provide thousands of US-based healthcare organizations an opportunity to benchmark their policies and procedures that support LGBTI+ patients, staff, and communities. Each year, the expectations evolve to require focused reviews on equitable policies and practices, non-discrimination and staff training, patient services and support, staff benefits and community engagement.</p>



<p>"In many ways, Mayo Clinic’s LGBTI+ staff are exemplary for fostering a sense of belonging within the workplace," said Dr. Anjali Bhagra, medical director of the Office of Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity. "When our LGBTI+ staff feel comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work it has a positive ripple effect for their colleagues and patients alike."</p>



<p>The 2024 HEI was the first time Mayo Clinic completed a combined submission for Arizona, Florida and Rochester. This new submission process meant that each of the LGBTI+ MERGs and the Office of Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity had to come together to jointly examine the policies, practices and internal/external programs that support LGBTI+ patients and staff at each site.</p>



<p>While the LGBTI+ MERG enterprise HEI survey workgroup is excited by this year’s top score, the team will continue to regularly meet ahead of the 2026 HEI submission to ensure forward progress to meet and exceed the elevated standards for the next survey.</p>

<p>"Over the last several years, we have worked increasingly to make surgery even less invasive," says Dr. Potretzke.</p>



<p>He performs hundreds of kidney stone surgeries each year. One of the most common is a ureteroscopy. (ureeder-oscopy)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/image.jpeg" alt="Aaron Potretzke, MD doing surgery, kidney stones" class="wp-image-387439" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/image.jpeg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/image-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/image-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Aaron Potretzke performing a kidney stone surgery</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types of kidney stone surgeries</h2>



<p>"We use a very small camera, about the size of a telephone cord, to go in through the urinary tract and visualize the stone, whether it be in the ureter or the kidney, or sometimes even in the bladder. And then we would break that stone up, if need be, usually with a laser, and then pick out the individual pieces," he says.</p>



<p>Another minimally invasive option is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/percutaneous-nephrolithotomy/about/pac-20385051?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">percutaneous surgery</a>, which may be recommended to remove very large kidney stones.</p>



<p>"So we make a small incision, usually about the width of a finger, in someone's back, and then use larger instruments and cameras to look into the kidney and break up those stones," says Dr. Potretzke.</p>



<p>Dr. Potretzke says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20355761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doctors</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic continue striving to make those incisions even smaller.</p>



<p>"And that actually ends up mattering because, while the incision on the outside is smaller, the actual amount of meat of the kidney that you're disrupting is quite a bit less. And therefore, we think that it, in many cases, may reduce the risk of complications, reduce the risk of pain and enhance recovery," Dr. Potretzke says.</p>

<p>Falls are the No. 1 cause of nonfatal injuries among children up to 14 years old in the U.S., according to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10528494/#:~:text=Falls%20are%20the%20leading%20cause%20of%20nonfatal%20injury%20among%20children,over%2030%2C000%20hospitalizations%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>. Many of these pediatric falls happen at home or on the playground.</p>



<p>Tom Halada, a Mayo Clinic registered nurse and pediatric trauma coordinator, says some of these injuries can be prevented.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="5184" height="2916" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_284519324_Fotor-16x9.jpg" alt="a group of happy children running and smiling near a playground" class="wp-image-237974" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_284519324_Fotor-16x9.jpg 5184w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_284519324_Fotor-16x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_284519324_Fotor-16x9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock_284519324_Fotor-16x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Children running and playing.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each year, more than 2 million children are seen in the emergency department in the U.S. because of fall-related injuries.</p>



<p>"The injuries can vary widely, and it's somewhat dependent on the age range for the patient," says Halada.</p>



<p>Infants and toddlers often get hurt tumbling off beds and changing tables. Windows and stairs can also lead to unintentional bumps and bruises.</p>



<p>"One way to prevent falls around the home would be to make sure that you have properly installed safety gates for your stairs and guards for the window," explains Halada.</p>



<p>Bigger kids sometimes end up at the hospital because of injuries related to biking, roller-skating and other recreational activities.</p>



<p>"Participation in any activity, you would want to make sure that the child is wearing correct and properly sized protective equipment, such as helmet, knee pads, elbow guards, wrist guards," says Halada.</p>



<p>Vigilant adult supervision can help reduce falls and accidents in children.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing pediatric falls</h3>



<ul>
<li>Move furniture away from windows to prevent climbing.</li>



<li>Strap babies in high chairs, swings and strollers.</li>



<li>Never leave a child alone in a shopping cart.</li>



<li>Keep windows locked and closed when not in use.</li>



<li>Create safe play areas.</li>



<li>Childproof home.</li>



<li>Always supervise young children.</li>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My family's colds are still lingering from the winter season, and I can't seem to kick this pesky cough. I've heard honey can help. Is it true?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>While we make think of honey as a pantry staple and natural sweetener for our morning tea or breakfast pastry, honey has long been used as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/want-to-ease-chronic-inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-inflammatory</a> and antibacterial substance. Topical use of honey can aid in healing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/burns/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20370545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burns</a>, and research says that honey can even help specific conditions such as reducing the risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, relieving gastrointestinal tract conditions such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diarrhea</a>, preventing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/memory-loss/art-20046326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory disorders</a> and even acting as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/antidepressants/art-20046273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antidepressant</a> with anti-<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a> benefits. </p>



<p>So, is this sticky liquid as beneficial for coughs?</p>



<p>There are a lot of different reasons why we think honey helps. Mainly, it helps soothe the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sore-throat/symptoms-causes/syc-20351635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throat</a>. As we swallow and the honey moves down the throat, it can help coat some of the receptors that can trigger the cough. Some honey has been shown to be more effective than over-the-counter <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cough-and-cold-combinations-oral-route/proper-use/drg-20061164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cough medications</a>.</p>



<p>Studies suggest that honey can act as a reliable cough suppressant for some people struggling with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/7-tips-to-combat-viral-upper-respiratory-illness/">upper respiratory infections</a> and nighttime coughing. Honey is made of mostly sugar, but also contains a mix of vitamins, minerals, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/iron-supplement-oral-route-parenteral-route/description/drg-20070148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iron</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-zinc/art-20366112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zinc</a>, antioxidants and amino acids. Although there are over 300 different varieties of honey varying in flavor and color, the honey you have in your pantry will do the trick.</p>



<p>Honey has been shown to be effective and safe for both adults and children ages 1 and above. For young children, it's usually recommended that you start with half a teaspoon to a teaspoon in some type of warm liquid. As they get older and they're able to swallow the honey more easily, you can give it to them directly on a teaspoon. You can do about a teaspoon every two hours, which is the same dose for adults as well. Keep in mind that honey will affect your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/expert-answers/diabetes/faq-20058487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood sugar levels</a> just as sugar does, so use it in moderation.</p>



<p>One of the reasons why infants should not have honey is the risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/botulism/symptoms-causes/syc-20370262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">botulism</a>. Botulism is a rare but serious form of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-poisoning/symptoms-causes/syc-20356230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">food poisoning</a>. The condition can occur when bacteria grow in the baby's intestines. It typically occurs in babies between the ages of 2 months and 8 months. In rare cases, this form of intestinal botulism also affects adults. Symptoms of botulism can include trouble swallowing or speaking, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-mouth/symptoms-causes/syc-20356048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dry mouth</a>, blurred or double vision, drooping eyelids, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/definition/sym-20050890">trouble breathing</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/definition/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nausea, vomiting</a>, facial weakness on both sides of the face, and paralysis. Symptoms can sometimes be life-threatening.</p>



<p><a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/transplant/newsfeed-post/unpasteurized-foods-and-raw-honey/#:~:text=Pasteurization%20is%20a%20heating%20process,extreme%20danger%20to%20transplant%20patients." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unpasteurized</a> honey puts younger children at higher risk for botulism. If you choose to use honey for cough suppression, we recommend that you use pasteurized honey to make sure that it's free of any kind of contaminants that could potentially affect you or your child. A bad cough can be really disruptive and get in the way of life, sleep, work and school. Honey can help. Feel better! <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mattke-angela-c-m-d/bio-20055584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Angela Mattke, M.D.</em></a><em>, Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></p>

<p>Emotional eating is eating to suppress or soothe negative emotions, such as stress, anger, fear, boredom, sadness and loneliness. It often leads to eating too much, especially overeating foods that are sweet, fatty and high in calories. And this can sabotage your weight-loss efforts.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/recommendations-to-begin-breast-cancer-screening-at-age-40/">Recommendations to begin breast cancer screening at age 40</a></h2>



<p>All women should begin breast cancer screening at the age of 40, says the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. In a new recommendation, the task force advises cisgender women and all other people assigned female at birth aged 40 to 74 years get screened every other year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-good-carbs-for-optimal-health/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Good carbs for optimal health</a></h2>



<p>Dr. Christine Nguyen, a Mayo Clinic family physician, says not all carbs are bad, and there are plenty of foods with good carbs. Fiber-rich foods like whole grains, fruits and vegetables are essential for health, aiding digestion, lowering cholesterol levels and reducing disease risk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ai-may-help-predict-risk-of-barretts-esophagus-and-esophageal-cancer/">AI may help predict risk of Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal cancer</a></h2>



<p>Esophageal cancer survival rates are low because it is often found at a later stage when symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, worsening heartburn, coughing and hoarseness have begun. Artificial intelligence may help predict the risk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/exploring-the-exposome/">Exploring the exposome</a></h2>



<p>Environmental exposures can accumulate in your body from the air you breathe, the food you eat, products you touch, water you drink, and more. These sometimes-harmful exposures have the potential to interact with each person's genes to influence health. </p>

<p>You experience sudden, intense pain in your abdomen or back pain between your shoulder blades — maybe even nausea or vomiting. You could have gallstones.</p>



<p>"Typically, symptoms of gallbladder-related pain is pain associated with meals. Usually after you eat meals with fatty foods," says Dr. Jorge.</p>



<p>He says there are several reasons why your gallbladder can form gallstones. The most common cause is what you eat. A diet high in fiber and low in cholesterol and fat will reduce your risk.</p>



<p>"Native Americans and Hispanic populations have a higher risk of developing gallstones and so do women. And as we get older, we're at higher risk of developing gallstones," says Dr. Jorge.</p>



<p>He says, once you have gallstones, they won't go away on their own. Recommended treatment is surgery to remove your gallbladder.</p>



<p>"It's an organ that people can live without and not have any long-term consequences from," says Dr. Jorge. "We take out the gallbladder not just because it has stones, but it's because it's where most stones are formed. But there is a small percentage of patients that can develop stones within the bile ducts themselves."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I see ads for collagen powder and supplements everywhere now, and my sister swears by it for fighting wrinkles. Does it actually help prevent aging? What exactly is collagen?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Collagen has been seen in the media in regard to having anti-aging properties. At least 30% of your body — skin, bones, tendons, organs — is made up of collagen. Collagen is a protein of the supportive tissue of the skin, which helps give it its tightness and suppleness. As you lose collagen over time, this can lead to sagging and thinning of the skin and the development of wrinkles, which can make you look aged. Much of the anti-aging industry focuses on maintaining or, hopefully, building collagen.</p>



<p>Collagen comes in the form of over-the-counter dietary <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-do-collagen-and-biotin-supplements-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supplements</a> such as capsules or powder, but it also can be consumed through gelatin found in foods such as Jell-O and marshmallows. Studies are unclear as to whether taking collagen by mouth, either through diet or by supplement, is beneficial. Oftentimes when research on collagen is performed, it is not performed on humans, or it may be performed on humans but in an amount that is impractical for your daily diet or habits over time.</p>



<p>When considering topical collagen products such as serums and moisturizers, keep in mind that collagen is a large protein with a complex structure that cannot be absorbed directly through the skin. Over-the-counter products may be labeled with fancy words such as "high hydrolyzed collagen peptides," which claim that the collagen's chemical structure is more absorbable in the gut lining or on the top of the skin so that it seemingly would be more active.</p>



<p>Topical products that are not medications are not registered through the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food and Drug Administration</a> in the same way that prescription medication is. Similarly, oral supplements are not regulated by the FDA in the same way that food and oral medications are regulated. With numerous products available on the market, it is difficult to tell how it has been tested, what it contains and if those ingredients are helpful, neutral or potentially harmful.</p>



<p>Another thing to be aware of is that in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/dermatology/sections/overview/ovc-20420526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dermatology</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/plastic-reconstructive-surgery-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20473067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plastic surgery</a>, as well as facial, ear, nose and throat surgery, collagen and fillers in the skin are given through other treatment methods in the office, such as by injection. So, if someone is interested in anti-aging properties and bringing more volume to the deeper layers of their skin, at this time, prescription or active medical intervention in a physician's office is suggested versus over-the-counter oral or topical treatment. If someone is interested in learning more, they should consult with their healthcare team.</p>



<p>The bottom line is, we don't know if topical or oral supplementation of collagen is beneficial for anti-aging purposes. There's no magic pill to reverse aging. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sunburn/in-depth/sun-damage/art-20546834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sun exposure</a> is a major cause of wrinkles, especially for people with fair skin. And <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20smoking%20causes%20lung,and%20some%20types%20of%20leukemia." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking</a> causes narrowing of the blood vessels in the outer layers of the skin and damages collagen. The most effective way to support your collagen for anti-aging is to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking/basics/quitsmoking-basics/hlv-20049487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid smoking</a> and exposure to secondhand smoke, limit alcohol use and consistently wear <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/sunscreen-agent-topical-application-route/proper-use/drg-20070255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunscreen</a>. <em>—</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/davis-dawn-marie-r-m-d/bio-20054974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dawn Davis, M.D.</strong></a><em><strong>, Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.</strong> </em></p>

<p>Hormone therapy is a treatment that uses medications containing hormones like estrogen or progesterone to replace those the body stops producing during <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a>. It can be a powerful tool for managing menopausal <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;"While hormone therapy can significantly improve quality of life and overall health for many women, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/smith-taryn-l-m-d/bio-20503248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Taryn Smith</a>, a Mayo Clinic internist and women’s health specialist.</p>



<p>She emphasizes the importance of a personalized medicine approach to hormone therapy, allowing healthcare providers to consider your health and potential risks.</p>



<p>Having discussions around menopause is important because it's often not a topic that is openly discussed or acknowledged, despite its significance and importance, she says. Menopause is a natural biological process, marking the time that a woman ends her menstrual cycle. It's diagnosed after a woman goes 12 months without a menstrual period.</p>



<p>"Many women don’t know how to navigate menopause and the symptoms that come along with it, such as <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-help-with-hot-flashes-due-to-menopause/">hot flashes</a> and night sweats. Hormone therapy is used to manage many of these symptoms," says Dr. Smith. "But it's not for everybody."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Four things Dr. Smith wants women to know about hormone therapy</h2>



<p><strong>Menopause symptoms and hormone therapy</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hormone therapy</a> is used to manage symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, trouble sleeping, and irritability.</p>



<p>"For the average healthy woman, these options are very safe. But if there are any concerns about these risk factors, it’s best to consult your physician or your women’s health specialist," she says.</p>



<p><strong>Treatment options </strong><br>Hormone therapy is a prescribed medication that can come in different forms, including patches, gels, sprays and oral medications.</p>



<p>Those options may include "A patch you wear on the skin, almost like a bandage in the lower groin or over the buttocks. We have gels that you can rub into the inner thigh and sprays that can be sprayed on the forearm. We also have some oral options.&nbsp; With all the options available, typically, we can find a good option that meets the average woman's needs," says Dr. Smith.</p>



<p><strong>Expected outcomes</strong><br>After starting hormone therapy, women can expect relief from symptoms. In many cases, hot flashes can be completely resolved, improving the woman’s quality of life.</p>



<p>"Often, we're able to completely resolve hot flashes. But if we cannot completely resolve them, we hope to get significant relief at least and help a woman restore her quality of life," she says.</p>



<p><strong>Safety concerns</strong><br>While there are safety concerns associated with hormone therapy, such as potential risks of breast cancer, stroke, or heart disease, it is generally safe for the average woman who is close to the menopause transition and younger than 60.</p>



<p>"For the average healthy woman, these options are very safe. But if there are any concerns about these risk factors, it's best to consult your physician or your women's health specialist," says Dr Smith.</p>



<p>For those who are unable to take hormone therapy or choose not to, there are FDA-approved <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/whats-the-best-nonhormonal-therapy-for-hot-flashes-experts-release-new-menopause-therapy-guidelines/">nonhormonal treatments</a> for menopause symptoms. Talk with your healthcare team to find out what is the best option.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC</strong>: I have a family member taking a prescription weight-loss drug. She has been successful thus far, which I know is improving her health. She admitted, though, that she often eats less than 1,000 calories per day. How can I encourage her weight-loss journey, but also ensure she is getting adequate nutrition?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> While <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss-drugs/art-20044832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss medications</a> are truly having a positive effect on many Americans’ health, it is important to also talk about nutrition. Not just the "please eat healthy and exercise" narrative (despite its truth), but making sure that patients on weight-loss medications are able to manage side effects, stay hydrated and consume adequate nutrients.</p>



<p>Medications for obesity approved by the Food and Drug Administration often work by decreasing appetite and increasing fullness. Popular <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/expert-answers/byetta/faq-20057955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glucagon-like peptide 1</a> medications slow gastric emptying, or the rate at which food leaves the stomach. This can lead to common side effects such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nausea/basics/definition/sym-20050736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nausea</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/constipation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">constipation</a> and vomiting. For most, these side effects are mild and temporary. They are likely to be most bothersome at medication start or with a dose increase, and they may resolve or improve within days to weeks. Keep your doctor informed about any severe side effects, and reach out if you are unable to eat or drink.</p>



<p>For many, side effects become manageable with time and intention. Users should eat slowly, avoid large meals, drink plenty of fluids and maintain protein intake. If calories become a concern (less than 1,200 a day), work on increased calorie and nutrient density with meals, beverages and snacks. Items such as Greek yogurt, smoothies, protein shakes and soups are often nutrient-dense and easy to digest. Soft, blended or liquid meals may be better tolerated. Remember that hydration is crucial because the lack of it may cause or worsen side effects including nausea, constipation, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/headache/basics/definition/sym-20050800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headaches</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/definition/sym-20050894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a>. Make sure to have water or another healthy beverage on hand, and sip throughout the day.</p>



<p>Building a bank of habits is key for the long haul. While more medication options will be available in the coming years, it’s important to consider skillset, should someone need or choose to go off the weight-loss drug. Weight regain can be a scary and very real concept. Just as someone who relies on a medication to keep their blood pressure in a healthy range, eliminating the medication would likely result in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension</a> again. That's why we use the word "tool" when it comes to weight-loss medications, procedures and surgeries. They are an added benefit, but that one tool is not doing all the work. By focusing on nutritious meals and establishing an exercise routine immediately, the groundwork is set for long-term success, regardless of whether the tool is being used in the future.</p>



<p>Rapid weight loss, whether from lifestyle changes, medications or procedures, will lead to some muscle mass loss. Focus on and divide sources of protein from food or beverages throughout the day. To not add volume to meals, brainstorm ways to add protein without adding bulk, like adding a protein powder or Greek yogurt to a morning smoothie, dipping veggies in cottage cheese or adding beans to a favorite soup. Eating protein as the first item in the meal is also a helpful strategy to make sure it's not left on the plate.</p>



<p>Engaging in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/strength-training/art-20046670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strength training</a> is equally as important. Start with body weight if needed, and increase weight or difficulty over time. Can't nail a push-up yet? That’s OK! Practice first by using the wall. Then try from the arm of a couch. Progress to your knees, and don't feel bad if a push-up from your toes just isn't going to happen. The goal here is to maintain and/or build all muscle groups, regardless of whether that pushup would get you through boot camp. Other <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/strength-training/art-20046031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">body-weight exercises</a> include squats, lunges, planks, triceps dips and wall sits. Lastly, enlist help. A multidisciplinary team is an excellent resource to address your needs and concerns. In addition to the medication prescriber, patients may benefit from programs designed specifically for weight-loss medication users.
