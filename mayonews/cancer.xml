<p>Carole Reisinger’s body was telling a story that nobody would ever want to hear.  </p>



<p>"It started last February when I was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney cancer</a>. Thanks to the medical staff at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>, five days later, I had a 9-by-5-centimeter tumor removed," says Carole Reisinger.</p>



<p>But it was during that surgery, the second story was about to be told.</p>



<p>"In the process of that surgery, the surgeons noticed my colon was inflamed and had a thickening of the wall.&nbsp; After speaking with the physicians a few days later, they proposed that I should get a colonoscopy done," the Warrens, Wisconsin, native adds.</p>



<p>After recovering, she took her physician's words to heart, and did the colonoscopy. It's something she says she should have done sooner.</p>



<p>"I had been having some signs of something wrong. My stomach had been crampy, and I did have blood in my stool at times," explains Reisinger.</p>



<p>In April, she was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884">rectal cancer</a>. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Morris-Andrew-D._30069560_202109131025-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-384770" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Morris-Andrew-D._30069560_202109131025-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Morris-Andrew-D._30069560_202109131025.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Andrew Morris, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Rectal cancer is a subset of colon cancer that is located at the final segment of your colon. Symptoms of bleeding and irregular bowel habits are common. Colon cancer begins when healthy cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. These changes unfortunately can also be hereditary," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/andrew-morris-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Morris, M.D</a>., <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/colon-and-rectal-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal and rectal surgeon</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse</a>. "Cancer inside the rectum (rectal cancer) and cancer inside the colon (colon cancer) are often referred to together as colorectal cancer."</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a> is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and the fourth-leading cause in women. The lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women.</p>



<p>The 64-year-old had to battle her second cancer in a matter of months. For the next six months, Reisinger would go through <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> and then radiation treatments at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/oncology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse</a>. In January of 2024, Dr. Morris and his surgical team removed the cancer, including most of the rectum.</p>



<p>"Advances in surgery have allowed colon and rectal cancers to be removed in a minimally invasive (small incision) fashion, often using the da Vinci robotic surgical system. Mrs. Reisinger was able to have the cancer completely removed, including the lymph nodes, and her colon reattached. Her recovery was generally quick due to the minimal pain related to the small incisions," Dr. Morris says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/rectal-bleeding/basics/causes/sym-20050740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Signs and symptoms</a> of rectal cancer include:</p>



<ul>
<li>A change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation or more-frequent bowel movements.</li>



<li>Dark maroon or bright red blood in stool.</li>



<li>Narrow stool.</li>



<li>A feeling that your bowel doesn't empty completely.</li>



<li>Abdominal pain.</li>



<li>Unexplained weight loss.</li>



<li>Weakness or fatigue.</li>
</ul>



<p>In some families, gene mutations are passed from parents to children increasing the risk of colorectal cancer. One in 3 people who develop colorectal cancer have other family members who have had it. Reisinger wasn't one of them.</p>



<p>"I know of no family history of colon cancer," she says. "After I was diagnosed, we did genetic testing, and that also came up with nothing. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones."</p>



<p>Besides family history, there are other factors that can lead to colon cancer:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Older age.</strong>&nbsp;Colorectal cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but most people with this type of cancer are older than 50. The rates of colorectal cancer in people younger than 50 have been increasing, but doctors aren't sure why.</li>



<li><strong>African American descent.</strong>&nbsp;People of African ancestry born in the U.S. have a greater risk of colorectal cancer than do people of European ancestry.</li>



<li><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease.</strong>&nbsp;Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon and rectum, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, increase your risk of colorectal cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Eating a diet low in vegetables.</strong>&nbsp;Colorectal cancer may be associated with a diet low in vegetables and high in red meat, particularly when the meat is charred or well-done.</li>



<li><strong>Too little exercise.</strong>&nbsp;If you're inactive, you're more likely to develop colorectal cancer. Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Diabetes.</strong>&nbsp;People with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Obesity.</strong>&nbsp;Obese people have an increased risk of colorectal cancer when compared with people considered at a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Smoking.</strong>&nbsp;People who smoke may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Drinking alcohol.</strong>&nbsp;Regularly drinking more than three alcoholic beverages a week may increase your risk of colorectal cancer.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/colorectal-cancer/statistics#:~:text=For%20rectal%20cancer%2C%20the%20overall,relative%20survival%20rate%20is%2074%25." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recent research</a> shows the overall five-year relative survival rate for people diagnosed with rectal cancer is 68%. If the cancer is diagnosed at a localized stage, the survival rate is 90%. If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues, organs and/or the regional lymph nodes, the five-year relative survival rate is 74%.</p>



<p>"The advances in chemotherapy, immunotherapy and surgical techniques are improving these survival rates in both rectal and colon cancer. Thankfully, the multiteam approach that is provided at Mayo with these cancers makes sure all treatment options and even study protocols are being used. Early detection is key though, as it gives the best chances for a cure," states Dr. Morris.</p>



<p>Reisinger's outlook is good. She can't thank the surgeons, physicians and medical staff at both Mayo Clinic in Rochester and Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse enough for helping her through both medical situations.</p>



<p>She does point out that all women (and men) should take responsibility and control of their own healthcare now and not wait until it's too late.</p>



<p>"My advice is to not put off a colonoscopy," says Reisinger. "Start at the age of 45 and begin paying attention to your body. Pay attention to your own bowel movements. They are a tattletale to your health."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While kidney cancer is rare in children, Wilms tumor is the most common type found in kids, with between&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/wilms-tumor/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500 and 600 children</a>&nbsp;diagnosed annually in the U.S. The disease most often affects kids ages 3 to 4.</p>



<p>Thanks to advances in treatments over the past several decades, survival rates from this rare cancer have improved significantly. Developing a treatment plan customized for each child with Wilms tumor has also helped to improve the prognosis for children with this disease. "Every Wilms tumor is different — in size, location, complexity, and whether it has spread to other organs," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/polites-stephanie-f-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20506073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephanie Polites, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric surgeon. "Having a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals who can develop an individualized care plan for each child is key."</p>



<p>Here's what families should know about treatment for this rare childhood cancer:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A team approach is best</strong></h2>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, treatment for Wilms tumor is planned by a team of healthcare professionals from multiple specialties. "From the moment a child is diagnosed with a kidney tumor, our team meets to discuss the plan of attack," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/granberg-candace-f-m-d/bio-20055572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Candace Granberg, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric urologist.</p>



<p>Dr. Granberg is part of the pediatric solid tumor team at Mayo Clinic, which includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pediatric oncologists: Doctors who specialize in treating children and young adults who have cancer.</li>



<li>Radiation oncologists: Doctors who specialize in treating cancer with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation therapy</a>, a type of cancer treatment that uses beams of intense energy — X-rays or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protons</a>&nbsp;— to kill cancer cells.</li>



<li>Pediatric radiologists: Doctors who specialize in using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/radiology/sections/overview/ovc-20469630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imaging technology</a>&nbsp;to diagnose and treat children with various conditions.</li>



<li>Pediatric surgeons: Doctors who specialize in performing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20475393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surgery</a>&nbsp;in children.</li>



<li>Pediatric&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/urology/sections/overview/ovc-20336015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urologists</a>: Doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating problems involving the male and female urinary tract and the male reproductive organs in children.</li>
</ul>



<p>This team meets to review the needs of each child with Wilms tumor and determines the first step for treatment. "We coordinate care to streamline appointments and procedures to minimize the frequency of trips families must take," says Dr. Granberg.</p>



<p>Before starting treatment, your child's care team will determine if cancer treatment could affect the child's future fertility. If so, they offer the family options for&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/02/15/planning-for-tomorrow-fertility-preservation-and-childhood-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fertility preservation</a>. These options will depend on a child's age, puberty stage, diagnosis and proposed treatment plan. At Mayo Clinic, procedures to preserve fertility are integrated with other treatment procedures or imaging scans whenever possible to minimize a child's exposure to anesthesia.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Surgeons need expertise in complex procedures</strong></h2>



<p>Treatment for Wilms tumor may begin with surgery to remove all or part of a kidney. At Mayo Clinic, pediatric radiologists construct life-size,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/anatomic-modeling-laboratories/overview/ovc-20473121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anatomic 3D models</a>&nbsp;of the Wilms tumor and surrounding structures to help with surgical planning. This approach is useful in challenging circumstances, such as removing only the part of the kidney containing the tumor (partial nephrectomy) or removing multiple tumors from one kidney.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/06/a-medical-illustration-of-a-child-with-a-Wilms-tumor-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of a child with a Wilms' tumor" class="wp-image-165822" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/06/a-medical-illustration-of-a-child-with-a-Wilms-tumor-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/06/a-medical-illustration-of-a-child-with-a-Wilms-tumor-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>Treatment often involves the surgical removal of the entire kidney and nearby lymph nodes through an incision in the abdomen. Given the substantial size of many Wilms tumors and their proximity to vital structures and organs, your child's pediatric surgical team needs to specialize in complex abdominal operations for children to ensure the best outcomes.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a tumor will extend into major blood vessels, and the approach requires the assistance of vascular surgeons who specialize in treating circulatory system diseases. "We are blessed at Mayo Clinic to have these specialists right down the hall from our pediatric operating rooms. They bring their entire team to our room and either reconstruct the major vessels or place grafts if needed," says Dr. Granberg. "These are procedures they do all the time, so having them there for these rare cases in kids is necessary for a successful surgery."</p>



<p>Chemotherapy can be used before surgery to shrink tumors and make them easier to remove. After surgery, it can kill cancer cells left in the body. Chemotherapy may also be an option for children whose cancers are too far along to be removed completely with surgery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New technology and research continue to improve treatment.</h2>



<p>Radiation therapy may also be used to treat Wilms tumor. Radiation therapy most often uses X-rays to beam intense energy to kill cancer cells.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proton beam therapy</a>, another important advancement in caring for children with Wilms tumor and other childhood cancers, may also be used. This highly targeted precision beam therapy destroys cancer while sparing healthy tissue. It's an important component of the treatment plan for children, as it prevents damage to developing organs and reduces long-term complications, side effects and secondary malignancies.</p>



<p>Research on Wilms tumor is ongoing, and Mayo Clinic researchers are studying new ways to treat this rare cancer. "Though a cure is possible in the majority of cases, we need to do better — we want to cure everyone," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/gargollo-patricio-c-m-d/bio-20211382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patricio Gargollo, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic pediatric urologist.</p>



<p>Dr. Gargollo and his colleagues recommend seeking a children's cancer center with experience treating Wilms tumors. With the right care team, children with Wilms tumor can have excellent outcomes.</p>

<p>Sally Blackwell&nbsp;was pregnant with her second child when she began noticing symptoms she initially brushed off as nothing.</p>



<p>She was experiencing constipation. She wasn't gaining weight during the pregnancy. She figured the lack of weight gain had to be because she wasn't doing the daily Chick-fil-A runs she did during her first pregnancy.</p>



<p>It wasn't until after her daughter was born in May 2021 that the symptoms became so severe they were impossible to ignore any longer.</p>



<p>She had a distended abdomen, "pencil-thin stools," and was in so much pain she found it difficult to sit.</p>



<p>She felt an abnormal growth and was told it was probably hemorrhoids by one physician. She saw another physician when the pain became unbearable and was told the same thing.</p>



<p>By this time, Blackwell says she was unable to eat much and her energy levels were dipping, and that wasn't a good thing with an infant at home. She began to feel desperate and scheduled an appointment with a local colorectal surgeon.</p>



<p>That's when she learned what she wasn't prepared to hear. She had a 5-centimeter mass that was later confirmed to be stage 3&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rectal cancer</a>.</p>



<p>She was 33.</p>



<p>"As soon as I learned about the tumor, I knew I wanted to be treated at Mayo Clinic," Blackwell says.</p>



<p>Her experience receiving cancer care at Mayo Clinic in Florida was so positive she decided she wanted to be a part of the organization.</p>



<p>Now a Mayo Clinic social worker, Blackwell shares more about her healthcare journey with&nbsp;<a href="https://intheloop.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the Loop</a>&nbsp;and what inspired her to join the Mayo team:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When did you come to Mayo Clinic for care?</h2>



<p>At the time, I was working at another area hospital. I had a friend,&nbsp;Samantha Inabinett, who I used to work with and knew I could confide in, who happened to work at Mayo Clinic in the GI Oncology clinic. I remember reaching out to her via text, and she immediately said, "I am here for you for whatever you need."</p>



<p>In a serendipitous turn of events, I had also been in a support group online of moms with children. Through that group, I made friends with another mom, Natasha, who also happened to be in the GI Oncology department at Mayo Clinic at that time. I reached out to her as well, and she also immediately flooded me with the support and knowledge I needed. They helped me navigate the Mayo system to get appointments set up.</p>

<p>On Nov. 15, 2021, I met&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jones-jeremy-c-m-d/bio-20469882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jeremy Jones</a>&nbsp;in Oncology. Quickly, MRIs, CTs and bloodwork were taken to confirm my diagnosis.&nbsp;On Nov. 18, 2021, I had my first chemotherapy treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My treatment plan started with a few months of chemotherapy, followed by radiation and then a life-changing surgery including an abdominoperineal resection&nbsp;(removal of the anus, rectum and distant colon), permanent colostomy and hysterectomy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What do you remember most about your experience at Mayo Clinic?</h2>



<p>I remember the kindness of all the staff — from the people who greeted me when I checked in, the medical assistants who took my labs and roomed me, the housekeeping staff and all the providers. Everyone took a general interest in my health and well-being.</p>



<p>I remember feeling so impressed with how efficiently appointments were scheduled so that my treatments could stay on track. When your life is in the hands of someone else, it is such a reassuring feeling to know that appointments are being scheduled quickly.</p>



<p>I can remember coming to my appointments with questions written on paper, and nobody I met ever batted an eye. I never felt like an inconvenience.</p>



<p>I remember meeting with the wound care nurse, Melanie, in the Colorectal Surgery Department before having my colostomy surgery. I had a full page of the most random questions, and she indulged me in answering every single one of them.</p>



<p>For me, having a colostomy was going to be life-changing, and I wanted to feel prepared. I would no longer be able to pick up my children, and I wanted to make sure I embraced every moment of life I possibly could. She showed me examples of all the supplies I would be using and how to use them. She even sent me home with an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/ostomy/art-20045825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ostomy</a>&nbsp;bag to try out before my life-changing surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What would you like other patients who are going through a similar experience to know?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, I want all patients and staff to know the warning signs of <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/category/cancer-type/colorectal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a>. The more we spread awareness of the signs, the more likelihood there is to save lives.</p>



<p>Colorectal cancer diagnoses are on the rise, especially in <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/03/19/youre-at-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-know-the-symptoms-get-screened/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">young people under 50</a>.</p>



<p>If you have symptoms, tell your doctor and don't be scared of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopy</a>. The prep is no fun — I will admit that — but it is necessary for treatment, and issues can be resolved before it progresses to cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am actively involved in many of the online&nbsp;<a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/group/colorectal-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer support groups</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/group/ostomy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ostomy support groups</a>. I want other patients to know that you are not alone. It is sometimes an isolating diagnosis to have colorectal cancer because it's taboo to talk about bowel habits.</p>



<p>Find your support network whenever you feel comfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What inspired you to look for work at Mayo Clinic?</h2>



<p>I owe my whole life to Mayo Clinic. My ability to tuck my kids in bed at night, go on dates with my husband, and take long walks dreaming and planning for the future, and my ability to celebrate holidays, birthdays and milestones with my family is all because Mayo Clinic saved my life.</p>

<p>I had my life-changing surgery in April 2022 with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merchea-amit-m-d/bio-20055739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Amit Merchea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dinh-tri-a-m-d/bio-20055484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Tri Dinh</a>.</p>



<p>After I recovered from surgery and some time had passed when I was cancer-free, I had the urge to see if there were any clinical social work positions available at Mayo Clinic. To my surprise, there were. I interviewed and was offered a position.</p>



<p>I started in November 2022 as a social worker in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liver Transplant</a>&nbsp;department. One of my favorite parts of my role is the opportunity to work with cancer patients on their journey to remission. I also meet other people with ostomies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What has been your experience working at Mayo?</h2>



<p>I have absolutely loved working at Mayo Clinic, and my personal experience has positively influenced how I relate to my patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I recently joined the Disability Mayo Employee Resource Group and hope to connect further with other disabled co-workers working in healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does your experience as a patient influence the way you work?</h2>



<p>As I approach the two-year cancer-free mark, it reminds me that it has been a while since I lost sleep wondering if I would be able to watch my children grow up.</p>



<p>It also has been a while since I had to juggle chemotherapy and radiation schedules with my work and life schedule. It has been a while since I had to hold my breath when opening my Mayo app to see my lab results. It has been a while since I counted the tiles in a treatment room. It has been a while since I got sick from treatment, had to wear gloves due to cold sensitivity from chemotherapy, or slept the whole day away.</p>



<p>It has been a while since cancer consumed every thought and conversation I had. It has been a while since I obsessed over recurrence rate statistics and searched the internet for other stories like mine.</p>



<p>Even though it has been some time, those experiences are part of who I am, and I remember them when I meet with patients at Mayo Clinic. It reminds me that while Mayo Clinic is a medical setting, a lot of life happens inside these walls and in our communities.</p>



<p>It is important to take care of the whole person — emotionally, spiritually, etc. — and that is why social workers are so important in the medical setting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How has the experience influenced your future career path?</h2>



<p>I no longer watch life happen from the sidelines. I no longer track time based on the next holiday or birthday, wondering if it will be my last. Although time continues to move forward on my cancer journey, if I close my eyes, it really does feel like yesterday.</p>



<p>My experience has solidified that I am committed to working at Mayo Clinic until the day I retire. Even then, hopefully, I can come back as a volunteer.</p>



<p>People often read about a mission for an organization and don't think about it too much. For me, "inspiring hope" is part of who I am now because Mayo Clinic inspired hope in me, and I just want to be able to do the same for others.</p>

<p>March is <a href="https://www.kidney.org/content/national-kidney-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Kidney Month</a>, which makes this a good time to learn about kidney cancer.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352664?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Kidney cancer</a> is cancer that begins in the kidneys, which are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fist. They're behind your abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of your spine. The kidneys remove waste from your blood and regulate a healthy balance between water, sodium and minerals in your bloodstream.</p>



<p>Approximately 81,600 new cases of kidney cancer ― more than 52,000 in men and 29,000 in women ― will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year, and 14,390 people ― 9,450 men and 4,940 women ― will die from the disease, according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/kidney-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>.</p>



<p>There may be no signs or symptoms early in the disease. In time, signs and symptoms of kidney cancer can develop, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Blood in your urine, which may appear pink-, red- or cola-colored.</li>



<li>Pain in your back or side that doesn't go away.</li>



<li>Loss of appetite.</li>



<li>Unexplained weight loss.</li>



<li>Tiredness.</li>



<li>Fever.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<p>Factors that can increase the risk of kidney cancer include older age, smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, treatment for kidney failure, certain inherited syndromes and a family history of kidney cancer.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352669?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Treatment</a> for kidney cancer usually begins with surgery to remove the cancer. For cancers confined to the kidney, this may be the only treatment needed. If the cancer has spread beyond the kidney, additional treatments may be recommended.</p>



<p>Small kidney cancers are sometimes destroyed using nonsurgical treatments, such as heat and cold. These procedures may be an option in certain situations, such as in people with other health problems that make surgery risky.</p>



<p>Kidney cancer that comes back after treatment and kidney cancer that spreads to other parts of the body may not be curable. Treatments may help control the cancer and keep you comfortable. In these situations, treatments may include surgery, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and radiation therapy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The genetic risk of breast cancer has been in the news lately. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center are working toward pinpointing individuals’ risk of developing breast cancer. The discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the 1990s enabled many women to learn they are at high risk of developing breast cancer. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic risk of breast cancer</a> has been in the news lately. Researchers at the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> are working toward pinpointing individuals’ risk of developing breast cancer.</p>



<p>The discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the 1990s enabled many women to learn they are at high risk of developing breast cancer. More than a dozen other breast cancer genes have been identified since, but the risks associated with them have been far less certain.</p>



<p>Research from Mayo Clinic has filled critical gaps in the understanding of how these genes predispose women to disease.</p>



<p>Breast cancer is typically broken down into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/in-depth/breast-cancer/art-20045654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four major molecular subtypes</a>&nbsp;— triple-negative, HER2-positive, luminal A and luminal B — each with different degrees of aggressiveness and responses to treatment.&nbsp;Through an industry collaboration with a genetic testing company, Mayo Clinic researchers analyzed testing results from nearly 55,000 breast cancer patients and found that&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32091585/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different breast cancer genes</a>&nbsp;appear to drive each of the different subtypes.</p>



<ul>
<li>In 2021, Mayo Clinic researchers and nearly 60 other researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471974/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a seminal study</a>&nbsp;in the New England Journal of Medicine that provided more accurate risk estimates for 28 different breast cancer genes and found that 16 of the 28 genes previously thought to play a role in breast cancer did not increase a woman’s risk of disease.</li>
</ul>



<p>Women newly diagnosed with cancer in one breast often want to know the chances that the disease will spread to the other breast or to other parts of the body.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Using data from the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility (CARRIERS) consortium, Mayo Clinic researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36623243/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">determined the risks</a>&nbsp;that women carrying different germline genetic mutations had of developing cancer in both breasts, known as contralateral breast cancer. For example, they found that carriers of ATM mutations did not have a significantly elevated risk of contralateral breast cancer, whereas those with BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 mutations had double the risk.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Colorectal cancer, the third-most common cancer in the U.S., has been rising among younger people for the past two decades. It is not one type of cancer but two cancers: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colon cancer</a>, which starts in the large intestine, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rectal cancer</a>, which begins in the last part of the large intestine, known as the rectum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Derek Ebner, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/sections/overview/ovc-20348241?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gastroenterologist</a>, notes that colorectal cancer has been increasing in adults under age 50, particularly for rectal cancer.

<p>"Historically, colorectal cancer was equally divided along the colon and rectum, but particularly for those with early onset colorectal cancer — age less than 50<sub>&nbsp;</sub>— we're seeing higher rates of rectal cancer among the younger onset," says Dr. Ebner.</p>

<p>Dr. Ebner says four key symptoms have been identified for people under 50 who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, seeing blood with bowel motions, as well as iron deficiency anemia," he says.</p>

<p>Dr. Ebner notes that blood loss after bowel movements, even if not visibly apparent, can lead to low iron levels.</p>



<p>"If on a blood test, for example, we see a sign of iron deficiency, that would then prompt us to explore further," he says.</p>



<p>Even though it may be embarrassing, he stresses, "If you have any of those symptoms, you need to share it with a healthcare provider. That way, they can navigate those subsequent steps."</p>



<p>Which can lead to early treatment and better outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reducing risks of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>While it's not possible to completely prevent cancer, there are ways to reduce your risks and that includes following a healthy lifestyle.</p>



<p>"Abiding by a healthy lifestyle is critical," says Dr. Ebner. "Following a well-rounded diet,  staying physically active, for instance, perhaps can be protective. The other key, though, is just being very mindful of those symptoms, and then also underscoring the importance of screening."</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Screening</strong>: Talk to your healthcare team about colorectal cancer screening.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise</strong>: Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Eat fruits, veggies and whole grains.</li>



<li><strong>Weight</strong>: Maintain a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Don't smoke, limit alcohol consumption.</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple myeloma is a cancer that forms in a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell that builds up in bone marrow.</p>



<p>"Some of these plasma cells develop mutations over time and become abnormal and produce an abnormal protein. We call it an immunoglobulin, or in our world, we call it a monoclonal protein. And so that can cause damage over time," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>The damage caused by multiple myeloma can lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351360?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anemia</a>, bone pain, frequent infections and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20369048?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney failure</a>.</p>



<p>"The treatment involves … we call it plasma cell directed therapy," says Dr. Cook. "It's treatments that are specifically directed at the immune system. So it's usually a combination of three or four drugs."</p>



<p>Other advances in treatment include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow transplant</a>, in which a person's own stem cells are infused after high-dose chemotherapy to rebuild and regenerate healthy bone marrow.</p>



<p>"We've seen new therapies like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20404319?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T</a>, or chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy, where we're taking people's T cells, we're engineering them to specifically recognize a myeloma cell," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>Because of advances like these, the prognosis for patients with multiple myeloma continues to improve.</p>



<p>"Several years ago, people would say that the survival was three to five years. And I would say now, median or average survival is about 10 years or even longer," says Dr. Cook. "Hopefully, we can extend the expected survival beyond 20 years and maybe eventually find a cure in my lifetime, I hope."</p>

<p>Multiple myeloma is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell in the bone marrow. When multiple myeloma develops in the bone marrow, cancerous plasma cells multiply, crowding out healthy cells.</p>



<p>"Over time, people develop abnormalities or mutations in their plasma cells. Those mutations cause plasma cells to become cancerous," says Joselle Cook, M.B.B.S., a Mayo Clinic hematologist specializing in multiple myeloma and other plasma cell disorders. "Older age is a risk factor. Multiple myeloma is commonly diagnosed in people in their 60s and 70s. We also know that Black people develop myeloma about 10 years earlier than white people, and two to three times more frequently."</p>



<p>Having a family history of multiple myeloma may also increase the risk of the disease.</p>



<p>An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/multiple-myeloma/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated 35,780 new cases</a>&nbsp;of multiple myeloma will be diagnosed in the United States in 2024. While multiple myeloma is a serious condition, people with the disease are living longer because treatments have advanced. "The prognosis has changed remarkably over the last few years," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>Read on for an overview of how multiple myeloma evolves, how healthcare professionals treat it, and the quest to find a screening test to diagnose the disease before it can damage the body.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The evolution of multiple myeloma</h2>



<p>Cancerous plasma cells — myeloma cells — make proteins that cause the symptoms and complications of multiple myeloma. "When the plasma cells develop mutations and produce a monoclonal protein, this group of conditions is called monoclonal gammopathies," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>The earliest phase of monoclonal gammopathies is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mgus/symptoms-causes/syc-20352362?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)</a>, which doesn't cause symptoms. When a person has MGUS, monoclonal protein, or M-protein, is found in their blood at a level too low to damage the body. "If we detect M-protein in a person's blood, and we aren't concerned about organ damage, we monitor them," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>If cancerous plasma cells continue to multiply and produce M-proteins, MGUS evolves into smoldering multiple myeloma. People still don't have symptoms at this phase but have a higher M-protein level in their blood and urine.</p>



<p>People with smoldering multiple myeloma are classified based on their risk of progressing to multiple myeloma: low risk, intermediate risk or high risk. "We may treat some people with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma, typically as part of a clinical trial, but for the most part, we actively monitor people without treating them," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>Multiple myeloma might be suspected when blood tests conducted for another reason raise red flags. "We may see that the protein is quite elevated or that a patient has a lower blood count than usual or an abnormality in their kidney numbers," she says. This prompts a care team to order blood tests to detect M-protein and assess blood chemistry and kidney function, urine tests to detect proteins, imaging tests to identify bone problems, and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-biopsy/about/pac-20393117?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow biopsy</a>&nbsp;to look for myeloma cells.</p>



<p>People with multiple myeloma can experience a variety of symptoms or none. This can make diagnosing the disease a challenge. When a healthcare professional suspects multiple myeloma, they frequently check for specific signs and symptoms. "People with multiple myeloma may have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351360?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anemia</a>. If the M-proteins deposit in the kidneys and cause them to fail, they will have kidney abnormalities. They may have bone pain and high blood calcium levels caused by bone destruction," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Multiple myeloma treatment options</h2>



<p>Treatment for multiple myeloma typically starts with a combination of medications called induction chemotherapy. "Treatment involves plasma-cell directed therapy," says Dr. Cook. "It's usually a combination of three or four drugs: A steroid, an immunomodulating agent (a drug that stimulates the immune system to fight cancer), an antibody (<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/anti-cd38-monoclonal-antibody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-CD38</a>) that targets a surface marker on the cancerous plasma cell, and a proteasome inhibitor that targets the cell's protein manufacturing."</p>



<p>Your care team will also decide if you are a candidate for a bone marrow transplant. "This decision depends on factors like fitness and age — it's a soft cut-off, but generally, we don't transplant patients over 75. There are exceptions, though," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>The drugs your care team uses in your induction chemotherapy will depend on your overall health and whether you are a candidate for a bone marrow transplant.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow transplant</a>&nbsp;— a stem cell transplant — is a procedure that infuses healthy blood-forming stem cells into your body to regenerate the bone marrow's ability to produce blood cells. Stem cell transplants can pose risks, and some people can have serious complications.</p>



<p>If eligible, people with multiple myeloma typically have a stem cell transplant after about four to six months of induction chemotherapy. Before the transplant, they receive a high dose of a different type of chemotherapy called conditioning chemotherapy.</p>



<p>Dr. Cook uses a garden metaphor to explain how conditioning and stem cell transplants work to treat multiple myeloma. "In myeloma, your bone marrow is akin to a garden overgrown with weeds (the myeloma). You use strong weed killers (the conditioning chemotherapy) to eliminate those weeds, but then the garden is barren. You need to plant seeds to allow the garden to grow. That's what a stem cell transplant does. The reinfusion of stem cells is like planting seeds so your bone marrow can recover faster."</p>



<p>Dr. Cook says other promising treatment options exist if you cannot undergo a bone marrow transplant. "For people who relapse after several types of treatment,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20404319?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a>, where people's T cells are engineered to recognize and kill a myeloma cell, offers great response rates and good survival. And we've seen success with new drugs called&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-researchers-study-new-class-of-drugs-to-treat-multiple-myeloma/">bispecific antibodies</a>&nbsp;— specially designed antibodies that redirect a patient's T cells (immune cells) to kill myeloma cells," she says.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162#:~:text=Radiation%20therapy%2C%20also%20called%20radiotherapy,methods%20of%20radiation%20are%20precise.?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radiation therapy</a>&nbsp;may also be an option to treat areas of the body affected by myeloma that are painful or causing other problems, says Dr. Cook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research aimed at catching multiple myeloma early</h2>



<p>"Being diagnosed early is important because you want to avoid organ damage, renal impairment and bone destruction. If we can detect and diagnose multiple myeloma early, we can prevent that damage," says Dr. Cook.</p>



<p>"MGUS and multiple myeloma are detected most often. It's less common to detect smoldering multiple myeloma," says Dr. Cook. She says researchers are exploring screening options — primarily blood tests — to identify MGUS and smoldering myeloma.</p>



<p>Dr. Cook is working with colleagues on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20562448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial</a>&nbsp;in Rochester, Minnesota, to screen people of East African descent. Other&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/05/23/is-a-cancer-clinical-trial-right-for-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trials</a>&nbsp;are studying people with MGUS and those in higher-risk populations. "There are screening studies focused on Black people and those who have first-degree relatives with myeloma or MGUS," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Cook is confident that the outlook for people diagnosed with multiple myeloma will continue to improve. "There are so many treatment options being developed," she says. "The field is just forging ahead."</p>

<p>Women have played a significant role in shaping Mayo Clinic's history and its future. In this Q&amp;A, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/radisky-evette-s-ph-d/bio-00094471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Evette Radisky,</a> a researcher and educator at Mayo Clinic, shares her perspective on the challenges some women face in scientific careers.</p>



<p>Dr. Radisky is a consultant in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-cancer-biology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Cancer Biology</a> and the associate dean of the <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in Florida</a>, where she is also a professor of cancer biology and pharmacology. She leads the<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/proteases-cancer/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Proteases in Cancer Laboratory</a> at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>QUESTION: Can you share experiences or observations about the challenges women in science face in advancing their careers in biomedical research?</strong></p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Despite achieving gender parity at the graduate school and postdoctoral levels, we still see a leaky pipeline with lower representation of women as we look up the ladder of faculty ranks and leadership roles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The journey toward career advancement involves balancing career aspirations with personal responsibilities, which for women often include family caregiving. The pivotal years of transition to research independence are demanding, marked by the need to obtain a highly competitive faculty position, establish oneself as an authority in a scientific niche, produce high-quality publications, win grants and promote one's research. For many women, these years coincide with starting or expanding a family, or taking on other caregiving roles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tug of war between these competing demands can feel overwhelming. Reflecting on my own path, I remember many moments of doubt, like one late night alone in a hotel room awaiting my first faculty job interview the next morning, separated for the first time from my infant daughter and very much questioning my career choice. Despite not securing that position, I remained determined, and after much practice and numerous interviews, I landed an amazing position at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later, as an assistant professor and new mother to my second child, I found myself in a stressed funding period for my lab and felt compelled to dedicate my six-week maternity leave to an NIH R01 grant application. The isolation I felt as I researched and wrote in my home office, depending heavily on others to care for my newborn, again made me doubt my path. Although that application was not successful, it laid critical groundwork for subsequent grant applications and eventually led to my securing the necessary support for the project, my laboratory and my research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Women routinely face these decisions and sacrifices as they seek career advancement in biomedical research. At some point along the path, many very talented women reflect on the cost of "success" and choose to reconsider their career trajectories in favor of a more satisfying balance. Each woman in biomedical research must forge a path that honors both her professional aspirations and her personal values, striving toward a career where success is measured by fulfillment and balance.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: What barriers in the scientific community disproportionately affect women, and how can they hinder career progression?</strong></p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Certain systemic attitudes and practices in science serve as barriers to the career progression of women. One is the absence of flexible mechanisms to pause and restart one's career trajectory, enabling time away from work to temporarily focus on personal or family responsibilities. This lack of flexibility often leaves women apprehensive that taking a leave could lead them to be judged as not serious or as insufficiently dedicated to their professional pursuits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another significant barrier is the entrenched expectation for scientists to relocate geographically and change institutions as a means of career enhancement. This expectation disproportionately impacts women, who may be reluctant to uproot their families in search of career opportunities. We see this in the pools of applicants for midcareer and established scientist positions; it is much less common for women to pursue moves that could lead to greater resources and leadership opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These systemic challenges emphasize the need for a shift toward more inclusive and flexible career pathways in the scientific community, acknowledging and accommodating the diverse life circumstances of its members.</p>



<p><strong>QUESTION: What strategies effectively promote women's career success in biomedical research, and how can gender equality in the field be further improved?</strong></p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;First, the visible presence of women as faculty and leaders has proven to be profoundly inspirational for those earlier in the career path, giving hope that achieving a successful career is not only possible, but a realistic and attainable goal, worth the effort and sacrifice. I remember how impactful it was for me when the first few female faculty were hired in the chemistry department at my training institution. Their presence and upward trajectory reinforced my aspirations and commitment to my career path.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, to further promote gender equality and support the career development of women in biomedical research, it is crucial to implement strategies that enhance career flexibility. The creation of off-ramps (structured opportunities to pause one's career) paired with on-ramps (pathways for reentry with support and mentoring) can give women greater flexibility in the tempo of their careers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third, expanding opportunities for career advancement within Mayo Clinic for our most promising internal candidates is essential. These pathways are particularly important for nurturing talented women who demonstrate great potential in research but are reluctant to relocate in search of career progression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Colon and rectal cancers may be detected during the same&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-importance-of-a-colonoscopy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screening</a>, but they are treated differently, says Dr. Eric Dozois.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our approach to rectal cancer, for example, often involves more aggressive treatments that help prevent it from coming back," says Dr. Dozois.</p>



<p>Innovation plays a strong role in rectal cancer surgery at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>.</p>



<p>Robotic surgery allows your surgeon to work more efficiently in small spaces, providing an enhanced view of the area where the operation is taking place. Some of the benefits include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Surgery performed while the surgeon sits at a console and uses controls to guide high-tech surgical tools.</li>



<li>Allows surgeons to work in small spaces with three-dimensional visualization, and with more precision, flexibility and control than with conventional techniques.</li>



<li>Minimally invasive, fewer complications, quicker recovery, fewer urological complications and may reduce nerve dysfunction.</li>
</ul>



<p>"We're using laparoscopic and robotic platforms to really offer patients surgery that is most up to date in terms of minimally invasive techniques, the least amount of trauma to the patient, but yet achieving the goals of surgery to remove the cancer," he says.</p>



<p>If colon cancer is caught early, surgery may be the only treatment that is necessary, but Dr. Dozois says, "Even in some of the earlier stages, a more aggressive approach that combines chemotherapy, radiation and surgery is necessary to keep it not only from coming back locally, but from spreading to other parts of the body."</p>
