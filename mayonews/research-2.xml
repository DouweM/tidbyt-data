<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Stem cell-based therapy improved quality of life for patients with advanced <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers and international collaborators discovered in a late-stage multinational clinical trial. In one of the largest studies of cell intervention after a heart attack, patients reported their daily hardship lessened when stem cells optimized for heart repair supplemented standard of care. This clinical study further documented lower death and hospitalization rates among those treated with cell therapy. This research is published in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38006196/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stem Cells Translational Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>"In this era of global aging, people live longer, yet are at risk of chronic disease imposing a poor quality of life. Heart failure is an emerging epidemic in need of new healing options," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/terzic-andre-m-d-ph-d/bio-00084640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andre Terzic, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular researcher and lead author on the paper. "The stem cell-based approach in the present study demonstrates sustained benefit on physical and emotional health in response to biotherapy." Dr. Terzic is the Marriott Family Director, Comprehensive Cardiac Regenerative Medicine for the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Approximately 800,000 people in the U.S. suffer <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attacks</a> every year. Damage to cardiac muscle weakens the heart's ability to pump blood through the body, leading to heart failure — a debilitating and life-threatening disease. People with heart failure often suffer a diminished quality of life associated with shortness of breath, fatigue, swollen legs and limited daily activities. Standard of care for heart failure includes a heart-healthy diet and habits, medications, implantable devices, and rehabilitation. However, current regimens do not work for everyone, especially in advanced disease stages.<br><br><strong>The research</strong></p>



<p>The study team recruited 315 patients from 39 hospitals in 10 countries who had advanced heart failure despite receiving standard of care. Patients were randomly divided into groups that would receive stem cell therapy versus those who would not. Patients assigned to cell treatment underwent cardiac catheterization. Then, stem cells taken from their own bone marrow and programmed to heal damaged heart tissue were delivered to the heart. Patients assigned not to receive stem cells had cardiac catheterization without cell delivery — known as the sham treatment.</p>



<p>All participants were asked to complete a 21-question self-assessment at the beginning of the study and then again at 26-, 39- and 52-weeks following treatment. For each question, they rated their physical, behavioral and emotional states on a scale of 0 to 5.</p>



<p>During the one-year follow-up, patients with preexisting left cardiac chamber enlargement consistently reported improved quality of life after cell therapy over those who received the sham treatment. In parallel, lower death and hospitalization rates were recorded among those who received stem cells.</p>



<p>"Data from one of the largest cardiovascular cell therapy trials, testing a regenerative technology discovered at Mayo Clinic, indicate benefit in both quantity and quality of life in advanced heart disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/yamada-satsuki-m-d-ph-d/bio-00028010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satsuki Yamada, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular researcher and first author on the study. "The benefit of regenerative care has been typically evaluated on the basis of clinician-reported outcomes. What's unique in this study is that it was designed to listen to the patient's experience."</p>



<p>This clinical trial was conducted in a double-blinded fashion, with both participants and their healthcare professionals masked during the study assignment. A double-blind study&nbsp;is designed to reduce the risk of bias when evaluating patient outcomes.</p>



<p>Further independent clinical studies are needed to validate the findings of this research.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic seeks to harness the power of cells, tissue and genes by delivering first-of-their kind therapeutics for patients in early-stage clinical trials. Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;is leading an effort that is at the crossroads of biology, engineering, industry and medicine to expand biomanufacturing for rare and complex disorders. Biomanufacturing is the use of living organisms such as cells in the manufacturing of new medicines.</p>



<p>On-site biomanufacturing helps Mayo Clinic validate new biologics in clinical trials, which aim to benefit patients in at least four ways:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong></strong><strong>Addressing the unmet needs of patients</strong></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic is driven by the needs of the patient. Innovative new therapies often originate from physician-scientist research teams who are seeking new treatments for complex conditions such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, kidney failure or cancer.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Allickson_WF782604_0002-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378671" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Allickson_WF782604_0002-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Allickson_WF782604_0002-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Allickson_WF782604_0002.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"With most of the diseases we are researching, there is no therapy available for the patient, or the care that is available is not effective," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, the Michael S. and Mary Sue Shannon Director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "Our goal is to advance cell and gene therapies that go beyond treating symptoms to cure patients. Our hope is to improve&nbsp; quality of life."</p>



<p>Dr. Allickson is also the Otto Bremer Trust Director, Biomanufacturing and Product Development, Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Examples of biologics — medicines from human sources such as blood, cells, genes and tissue — are immunotherapies to kill <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood cancers</a> and an experimental, cell-based vaccine to stop the spread of ovarian cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong></strong><strong>Accelerating the most promising discoveries to patient care</strong></h2>



<p>Biomanufacturing provides a bridge that transitions promising discoveries from the lab to first-in-human clinical trials. The goal is to advance technologies that would have broad clinical use for all patients who need them.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Wilkins_WF2365896_0072-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378672" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Wilkins_WF2365896_0072-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Wilkins_WF2365896_0072-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Wilkins_WF2365896_0072.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cynthia Wilkins, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We're manufacturing medicines that we hope will transfer seamlessly to commercial markets," says Cynthia Wilkins, Ph.D., senior director of process development in the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "Working with industry can provide the support needed to move new medicines forward.'"</p>



<p>After validating biotherapeutics in phase 1 or 2 clinical trials, Mayo Clinic wants to license the technology to industry collaborators. From there, those licensees could advance the new drugs to regulatory approval and clinical care for patients around the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong></strong><strong>Increasing collaboration and innovation</strong></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic is expanding its Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) facilities to manufacture experimental medicines on all its campuses. CGMP facilities are clean rooms where drugs are manufactured in aseptic (free of contamination) environments that meet Food and Drug Administration specifications for safety, identity, strength purity and quality.</p>



<p>With on-site facilities, Mayo's biomanufacturing team can work side by side with researchers to address problems quickly and find innovative solutions. On-site manufacturing capabilities also may enable Mayo to circumvent scheduling backlogs and delays that may occur with external contract manufacturers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Rai_Snigdha_30267242_20230417-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378674" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Rai_Snigdha_30267242_20230417-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Rai_Snigdha_30267242_20230417.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Snigdha Rai, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This collaboration gives us immediate feedback on how the biomanufacturing process is progressing. That helps us respond to issues quicker," says Snigdha Rai, Ph.D., senior director of advanced biomanufacturing for the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "If we can troubleshoot quicker and more effectively, then we can get the therapeutic to patients sooner. We want to avoid situations in which we find a problem at the final manufacturing stage and need to start over."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has established a robust biomanufacturing structure that includes process development, quality control and quality assurance to ensure a drug has consistent quality once it is scaled up for production.</p>



<p>"On-site collaboration helps ensure we are not deviating from what the investigator wants. If a change is needed in process development, we are able to connect immediately with the investigator," says Dr. Wilkins. "If we're having challenges transferring the discovery to biomanufacturing, we can readily communicate with the investigator and ask, 'What do you know that can help us fix the problem?'"&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applying a 3-pronged approach to new therapeutics</strong> </h2>



<p>A unique advantage of biomanufacturing at Mayo Clinic is the immediate application it has to patients participating in a wide variety of clinical trials. Physicians work with the biomanufacturing team to help them understand how the process can be shaped to meet the needs of those patients.</p>



<p>"Mayo's approach breaks down the silos. By working directly with physicians, we get to see a variety of medicines for many different types of diseases. That's very exciting. It's different from some other organizations in which the operational side does not interact with the clinical side," says Rai. "That inspires hope we can deliver lifesaving therapies for patients in need of new options."</p>



<p>Education is another critical component that Mayo Clinic integrates into its biomanufacturing strategy.&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>&nbsp;is one of the first to offer a doctorate in regenerative sciences with coursework in biomanufacturing for future physicians, scientists and allied health staff.</p>



<p>Biomanufacturing is regulated and complex. The deep collaboration with scientists and physicians across research, education and the practice has uniquely positioned Mayo to advance new biologic therapies for unmet patient needs.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Patients who received the anticoagulant drug <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/warfarin-oral-route/description/drg-20070945?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warfarin</a> after <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/aortic-valve-repair-aortic-valve-replacement/about/pac-20385093?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement</a> had lower incidence of mortality and a decreased risk of blood clots, according to a retrospective study published in <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00404-4/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>.</p>



<p>The use of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement has increased significantly during the past decade. Among its advantages is that most patients can avoid warfarin for anticoagulation treatment. Even so, research has been conflicting on whether patients would benefit from more aggressive early postoperative anticoagulation treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers analyzed nationwide data on more than 10,000 patients who underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. Warfarin use was associated with a 32% reduction in mortality risk. Patients treated with warfarin early postoperatively also had an increased risk of major bleeding events.</p>



<p>"The findings support early warfarin use in appropriately selected patients, such as patients with low bleeding risk," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/schaff-hartzell-v-m-d/bio-20053174?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hartzell Schaff, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular surgeon who contributed to the study. "There’s often reluctance to prescribe anticoagulant treatment early after surgery due to concerns about bleeding and uncertainty about benefits. Our research finds that the small increased hazard of bleeding (4% versus 2.3%) may be an acceptable risk given the benefits in terms of mortality risk as well as reduced risk of thromboembolism."</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic study analyzed deidentified patient data from 2007 to 2019 using OptumLabs Data Warehouse, which contains claims data of commercially insured and Medicare Advantage enrollees of all ages and races throughout the U.S.</p>

In particular, she was curious about the body's natural ability to fight tumors: Could that process be improved? In the laboratory of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dong-haidong-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Haidong Dong, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, she joined efforts to learn more about the T cells that are part of an inherent cancer-killing immune response.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Dr._Joanina_Gicobi-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378091" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Dr._Joanina_Gicobi-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Dr._Joanina_Gicobi.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joanina Gicobi, Ph.D.,</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"From the beginning, she was asking impressive questions about an issue that's been a great challenge," says Dr. Dong, whose lab focuses on cancer immunology and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>The inquisitive approach to problem-solving paid off. Dr. Gicobi, who recently completed her Ph.D. thesis, Dr. Dong and a team of Mayo Clinic researchers have provided a new understanding of the body’s cancer-fighting T cells, known as CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells. In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi2414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science Advances</a>, the research team describes a previously unknown type of CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells that can withstand the toxicity of treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The cells, which they call resilient T cells, remain functional, suggesting there may be additional opportunity after chemotherapy and radiotherapy to target the cancer via the immune system. What's more, the team identified a potential strategy to bolster the cancer-killing capabilities of these hardy cells.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scrutinizing cells that survive</strong></h2>



<p>One detail that has baffled researchers about CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells is their persistence, particularly in patients who seem to have run out of treatment options.</p>



<p>Some people with advanced cancer undergo what’s known as "salvage therapy" to ease late-stage symptoms. Salvage therapy may include chemotherapy and radiotherapy to shrink tumors that are not responding to immunotherapy or are too large to remove surgically, though the treatments are typically not expected to be a cure. However, researchers had noticed that even after several rounds of therapies that kill off immune cells along with the cancer, some patients sometimes still had cancer-killing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells circulating in their blood. And those cells, however beaten down, seemed capable of rallying an immune response.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Dr._Haidong_Dong-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378092" style="width:332px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Dr._Haidong_Dong-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Dr._Haidong_Dong-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Dr._Haidong_Dong.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Haidong Dong, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"But we didn't know the nature of these particular CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells, how to identify them or what might make them unique," Dr. Dong says, adding that the lab hit numerous dead ends as they tried to characterize the cells. "It was not a straightforward route as we searched for answers."</p>



<p>The team monitored a cohort of patients who underwent salvage radiotherapy and then examined those patients' T cells. People who responded better to radiotherapy had T cells that used cellular energy most efficiently and could still kill cancer cells. Somehow the cells were less "exhausted" than other T cells. However, the phenotype didn't fully distinguish what was special about the cells.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Following the data</strong></h2>



<p>In her research, Dr. Gicobi set out to look for molecular markers particular to the T cells that rebound after cancer treatment. Using RNA sequencing, which can provide a map of all potential gene expression in a cell, she came across interesting findings that pointed back to certain genes. Dr. Gicobi noted several genes that were slightly different from those in typical CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells. Among them, she found a gene related to the cells' metabolic pathway, the process by which the cells produce and burn energy. This aligned with the earlier finding, and Dr. Gicobi felt encouraged to delve into the metabolism of the cells as a key differentiator.</p>



<p>"Dr. Dong has told me through my training, 'Always follow the data,'" Dr. Gicobi says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Cancer-T-cells-Dong-mRNA1x1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378090" style="width:214px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Cancer-T-cells-Dong-mRNA1x1.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Cancer-T-cells-Dong-mRNA1x1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A confocal microscopy image of resilient T cells over-expressing the enzyme ME1.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As the team members looked further, they found the cells had heightened expression of the enzyme called malic enzyme 1, or ME1. "That was really interesting to us because ME1 is known to deal with molecules called reactive oxygen species, a metabolic byproduct that is important for the functions of immune cells but toxic when in excess. So we were looking at an enzyme that helps reduce the negative effects of metabolic pathways," she says. The finding helped confirm that the resilient T cells in people are a distinct subgroup of CD8<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;T cells.</p>



<p>Then, Dr. Gicobi had the idea that tinkering with ME1 to address the function and energy of immune cells might heighten their response to a tumor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She engineered the resilient T cells to overproduce ME1. The laboratory experiments found the increase of ME1 revived the cells and made them even better at killing off tumor cells.&nbsp; Importantly, Dr. Gicobi says, "We were able to increase their cancer-killing capacity without the accumulation of reactive oxygen species that induce cellular exhaustion."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During her graduate training, Dr. Gicobi presented the findings at the annual meeting of the American Association of Immunologists.</p>



<p>Says Dr. Dong, "The excitement and the questions from attendees were a sign that this work suggests new approaches and more options for improving T cell health, which is an important avenue for the field."</p>



<p>He says further research is necessary to determine how resilient T cells affect patient outcomes and why some people have resilient T cells and others don't. He also hopes to learn more about the mechanisms underlying the function of resilient T cells and to explore the potential development of ME1 as a therapy.</p>



<p>But an important first step has been the understanding that the presence of resilient T cells indicates the perseverance of the body's inherent immune response. "This is one milestone toward new discoveries that can hopefully be translated to help patients," he says.</p>

<p>With age, cells can experience senescence, a state where they stop growing but continue releasing inflammatory and tissue-degrading molecules. When a person is young, the immune system responds and eliminates senescent cells, often referred to as zombie cells. However, zombie cells linger and contribute to various age-related health problems and diseases. Mayo Clinic researchers, in two studies, shed light on the biology of aging cells.</p>

<p>"We know people age at different rates and that a person's chronological age doesn't always match their biological age," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/st-sauver-jennifer-ph-d/bio-00027743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer St. Sauver, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;the lead author of the study and scientific director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/education-training/population-health-scholars-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Population Health Science Scholars Program</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a>. "We found that a group of diverse proteins secreted by zombie cells can serve as biomarkers of senescence and can predict health outcomes in older adults. We also found that measuring these biomarkers in the blood can help predict mortality beyond the combination of a person's chronologic age, sex or presence of a chronic disease."</p>



<p>The study included 1,923 adults aged 65 and older with one health condition or none. The group included 1,066 women and 857 men, with 68% of study participants having no chronic conditions and 32% having one condition.</p>

<p>"What's so unique about this study is that even in the absence of disease, biomarkers are highly predictive of bad health outcomes in the future," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lebrasseur-nathan-k-ph-d-m-s/bio-00055041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nathan LeBrasseur, Ph.D.</a>, director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-arlene-kogod-center-aging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging</a>&nbsp;and senior author of the study. Dr. LeBrasseur studies the biological processes that drive aging.</p>



<p>The researchers noted that the most common chronic conditions in the group were arthritis, high cholesterol and a history of cancer.</p>



<p>Researchers found that higher levels of specific senescent biomarkers, such as GDF15, VEGFA, PARC and MMP2, were all associated with an increased risk of death. Some of these biomarkers have been associated with developing chronic diseases. For example, research has shown that people with heart disease and some types of cancers have higher levels of GDF15 and VEGFA. Ongoing studies are investigating how lifestyle factors, including diet, physical activity and medications that appear to help clear senescent cells, influence the circulating levels of the biomarkers.</p>



<p>Dr. LeBrasseur envisions using these biomarkers as tools for clinical practice to find people at risk for health challenges. In addition, research could benefit from identifying subjects who may be most responsive to emerging ways to target senescent cells and gauge their responsiveness to treatment.</p>



<p>Dr. St. Sauver underscores the need to include more diversity in future studies, ensuring various populations are included in ongoing aging research.</p>



<p>"We did see differences in levels of these biomarkers between men and women, and we also know that race and ethnicity influence many biological processes," says Dr. St. Sauver. "For future studies, we must consider these factors in aging research."</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researcher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/passos-joao-ph-d/bio-20454365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joao Passos, Ph.D.</a>, who also studies the biology of aging, sees his main purpose as working to enhance the vitality and health span—the period of life free from the consequences of disease and disability—in older people.</p>



<p>In a new study published in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37821702/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a>, he, along with postdoctoral researcher Stella Victorelli, Ph.D., and a large interdisciplinary team of collaborators, uncovered a previously unknown phenomenon that occurs in zombie cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mitochondria, the tiny powerhouses within a cell, are responsible for producing energy but also play a crucial role when a cell incurs excessive damage. They can initiate a self-destruct mechanism called apoptosis, which leads to a cell's death. Senescent cells, which do not die, are notorious for resisting apoptosis. These two processes, apoptosis and senescence, have often been regarded as opposite cell fates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Dr. Passos, Dr. Victorelli and the team unexpectedly observed a small group of "rogue" mitochondria attempt to initiate apoptosis in senescent cells. When they do so, these mitochondria release their DNA into the cell's cytosol, the "soup" inside a cell. Mitochondria were once independent bacteria, so the cell perceives the mitochondrial DNA as foreign, which sparks inflammation that can damage tissues and lead to disease.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the researchers found that if they blocked this process in mice equivalent in age to a 70-year-old human, they could reduce tissue inflammation and significantly boost their health, including improving their strength, balance and bone structure.  </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Stella-Victorelli-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378426" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Stella-Victorelli-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Stella-Victorelli-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Stella-Victorelli.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Stella Victorelli, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This newfound knowledge of the inner workings of a senescent cell may open doors to new types of therapeutics, beyond senolytics that eliminate senescent cells, to improve peoples' health span.</p>



<p>"Inflammation is one of the main ways we think senescent cells cause detrimental effects in aging-related diseases. So, it's exciting to have found a way to target a pathway that reduces inflammation," Dr. Victorelli explains.  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mapping out the big picture </strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Passos and colleagues, in collaboration with researchers across the U.S., are part of an ambitious project to map senescent cells across different tissues. The project is called the Cellular Senescence Network (<a href="https://sennetconsortium.org/involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenNet</a>) and is funded by the National Institutes of Health Common Fund. Its primary objective is to compile a comprehensive atlas of senescent cells within the human body over a lifetime. Dr. Passos recently spearheaded an effort published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00446-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Aging</a>&nbsp;to highlight emerging technologies and challenges in&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2021/11/10/a-zombie-cell-expedition-and-other-senescent-cell-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spatial mapping of cellular senescence</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"By targeting these fundamental mechanisms driving the aging process rather than tackling each disease individually, we have the potential to not only fight one disease of aging but all of them," Dr. Passos says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart failure is a potentially urgent health concern for young <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-congenital-heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355456?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adults with congenital heart disease</a> (ACHD) that is often overlooked and undertreated, even as hospitalizations for this condition continue to rise. New research from Mayo Clinic shows that young adults in the U.S. living with congenital heart disease are at an increased risk of death or cardiovascular complications after being hospitalized for heart failure. However, study data published in the <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Heart Association</a> also found that patients who had been receiving recent cardiology care before a heart failure hospitalization were less likely to die.</p>



<p>"More than 85% of children born with congenital heart disease reach adulthood. They are likely to experience complications later, yet 61% of these patients beyond the age of 18 do not see a cardiology specialist," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/medical-innovation/burchill-congenital-heart-disease?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke Burchill, M.B.B.S., Ph.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. "These young adult patients have a strong need for individualized care pathways to improve their quality of life and monitor health issues like heart failure."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.118.008775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prior research</a> showed that heart failure hospitalizations of U.S. adults with congenital heart disease increased dramatically from 1998 to 2011. To further understand this trend and its effect on patients and hospital resources, Dr. Burchill and colleagues used national data to study a retrospective cohort of adults with congenital heart disease hospitalized in the past decade. The percentage of ACHD heart failure hospitalizations increased significantly, rising from 6.6% in 2010 to 14% in 2020.</p>



<p>In more than 26,000 unique hospital admissions of ACHD patients, 22% had heart failure and 78% did not. Those admitted with heart failure had a higher risk of death and other major heart and brain complications and used more healthcare resources, including rehospitalization and post-acute care services than those admitted without heart failure. However, people who had a cardiology clinic visit within 30 days prior to hospital admission had lower rates of death due to any causes at the 90-day and 1-year mark.</p>



<p>The ACHD patients with heart failure were nearly twice as likely as those without heart failure to be readmitted to a hospital, especially those under age 45, regardless of their type of congenital heart disease. Younger patients also required more medical or supportive care after they left the hospital before they could return home and care for themselves.</p>



<p>"Many of the patients I meet with ACHD and heart failure share a similar story of not having their heart-related symptoms taken seriously, leading to a delayed recognition and treatment of heart failure. The good news is that we can reset the course for most," says Dr. Burchill. "We have new medications to restrengthen the heart, new options for replacing heart valves without opening the chest, and low-risk treatments for returning heart rhythm to normal. Our goal is to shift the focus from heart failure to heart function and patient success in feeling better and living longer."</p>

In this first genome-wide association&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37800334/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, the researchers sought to understand why some patients get better after developing the condition — and some don't.</p>



<p>"We found genetic variation in the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene, a gene that no one has heard of in cardiology, and its link to improvement in heart function in these patients," says lead author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/pereira-naveen-l-m-d/bio-20055103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, who studies genetic variation and its implications in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease, specifically heart failure.</p>



<p>Genetic variation in the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene can lead to differences in the protein's structure, potentially influencing a person's susceptibility to various diseases or their response to specific therapies.</p>



<p>The researchers identified and examined the role of the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene because of this gene's link to improving the heart's left ventricle to pump blood effectively in people with dilated cardiomyopathy. The&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene is often variably expressed in fibroblasts (connective tissue) of people with this condition. In addition, fibrosis (excess fibrous connective tissue in the heart) plays an essential role in the prognosis of this disease.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Naveen-Pereira-200x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378322" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Naveen-Pereira-200x300.png 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Naveen-Pereira.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Pereira notes interestingly that they also found that genetic variation in or near&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;was significantly associated with death due to heart failure.</p>



<p>They also noted that decreasing this gene’s expression in cardiac connective tissue significantly decreased cardiac fibroblast proliferation and downregulated the&nbsp;<em>IL1RL1</em>&nbsp;gene. This gene encodes one of the most important heart failure biomarkers, sST2. High levels of this biomarker are associated with fibrosis and death; a decrease in&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;decreases the expression of this protein. Understanding the regulation of sST2 and its relationship with&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;and fibrosis is essential for developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of heart failure.</p>



<p>Dr. Pereira explains that these findings raise the possibility of targeting the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene to decrease cardiac fibrosis, which may improve heart function. The study, therefore, has implications for developing new drug therapies for dilated cardiomyopathy and potentially other conditions affected by fibrosis.</p>



<p>According to a report from the American Heart Association, heart failure is an increasingly common diagnosis in the U.S., with a projection of affecting over 8 million people by 2030, an increase of 46% from the present day.</p>



<p>Between 30% and 40% of heart failure cases are due to dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>



<p>"It is the most common cause of a person needing a heart transplant," says Dr. Pereira. “A key indicator of whether patients with dilated cardiomyopathy will recover is whether they have cardiac fibrosis.”</p>



<p>Based on these preliminary findings, the Mayo researchers are doing further animal studies to understand the effect of&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;on heart failure. They are developing molecules to assess their therapeutic potential for dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.</p>



<p>"By continuing with this research that started with a human population that we took to the molecular and now animal laboratory, we hope to find new avenues for treatments to take back to the human population we studied, to improve patients' survival and quality of life ultimately," says Dr. Pereira.</p>

<p>During breaks from his doctoral research in London, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vile-richard-g-ph-d/bio-00027663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</a>, would visit a pediatric brain tumor clinic next to his lab for inspiration. Seeing children suffer changed the course of his career, igniting his passion for finding <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> treatments that would be easier for people to tolerate.</p>



<p>"I became very, very motivated to try and apply the science I learned to make cancer treatments gentler," says Dr. Vile. "My goal was to deliver an option that would extend and improve quality of life."</p>



<p>Decades later, Dr. Vile is leading research into genetically engineered viruses aimed at unleashing a two-pronged attack on cancer. One part of this technology, known as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/oncolytic-virus-optimizes-car-t-cell-therapy-for-solid-tumors/mac-20537878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oncolytic virus</a>, is designed to infect, break open and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. Dr. Vile's <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn2231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preclinical studies</a> have shown that oncolytic viruses replicated in cancer cells and cascaded to kill other diseased cells. That, in turn, triggered an immune response in which the patient’s own T cells, stimulated by the virus, recognized and targeted metastasized tumors for a second wave of cancer destruction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005.jpg" alt="Richard Vile, Ph.D." class="wp-image-377676" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005.jpg 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"Oncolytic viruses are a way to alert the immune system and mobilize it to kill cells infected with cancer," says Dr. Vile. "There's the direct killing of cancer cells with the virus, and then there's the major effect of immune activation. The immune system is incredibly well evolved to recognize infection, clear infection and kill all the cells around it that could be harboring infection."</p>



<p>In groundbreaking research, Dr. Vile's team is combining oncolytic viruses with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy</a>) to target solid tumors from liver cancer. This experimental approach of loading CAR-T cells with oncolytic virus is a new way to expand CAR-T cell therapy beyond treatment for blood cancers into treatment for solid tumors.</p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy is a regenerative immunotherapy in which a patient's T-cells are genetically modified to recognize and stop cancer. It has shown great promise by putting some B-cell lymphomas and leukemias into remission. CAR-T cells are highly targeted to tumor cells, with the goal of having fewer side effects than cancer treatments that also kill nearby healthy tissue.</p>



<p>"Loading the oncolytic virus onto CAR-T cells may give us three levels of killing. First, the CAR-T cells target the tumor and kill some of the cells," says Dr. Vile. "Next, it delivers the oncolytic virus, which infects tumor cells, replicates and kills them. Third, that alerts the immune system of the patient to the fact that there's something majorly wrong. The immune system starts to see the cancer and starts to react against it and kill it."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;supports Dr. Vile's research as part of its objective of delivering new cell therapies to people with complex disorders such as cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing the challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Oncolytic viruses are advancing from the lab to first-in-human clinical trials. Dr. Vile is working with the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics to biomanufacture oncolytic viruses onsite in Mayo Clinic's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) facilities. CGMP facilities are sterile rooms that help ensure that the therapy meets the identity, strength, quality and purity standards that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires for testing new therapeutics.</p>



<p>On-site biomanufacturing could lower production costs, allow for more individualized treatment and deliver the treatment to patients sooner than might be possible with an outside manufacturer.</p>



<p>"We are completing our studies in the lab and are transitioning to safety studies in the patient," explained Dr. Vile. "At the same time, we will manufacture the virus at a level of cleanliness (sterility) to meet FDA standards."</p>



<p>Oncolytic virus therapy is evolving, with more research needed to validate its safety and effectiveness. Dr. Vile hopes to test oncolytic viruses with CAR-T cell therapy for liver cancer in a phase 1 clinical trial in the next year or two.</p>

<p>A recent Mayo Clinic retrospective&nbsp;<a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.23.00118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;shows that cancer practices can integrate telehealth without duplicative care, allowing for a more streamlined healthcare experience for patients and their caregivers.</p>



<p>Researchers analyzed trends in telehealth use from 2019 to 2021 across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/3-sites-1-comprehensive-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. The study looked at hematology and oncology visits conducted across Mayo Clinic campuses in Minnesota, Florida and Arizona, as well as at community-based clinics across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a>.</p>



<p>In 2019, telehealth visits accounted for fewer than 0.01% of all visits. In 2020, a significant rise in telehealth use occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the portion of visits conducted via telehealth increasing to 11%. By 2021, that figure rose to 14%, demonstrating a continued turn toward telehealth beyond the immediate pandemic response.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Pritchett_Joshua_C._16081960_20230925-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378074" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Pritchett_Joshua_C._16081960_20230925-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Pritchett_Joshua_C._16081960_20230925.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joshua C. Pritchett, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We're showing that not only did our providers continue to use telehealth after the initial surge, but adoption (of the technology) increased over time and did not lead to increases in per-patient or per-provider care volumes," says lead author of the study, Joshua C. Pritchett, M.D., a hematology and oncology fellow at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Overall, researchers examined over 100,000 visits conducted from 2019 to 2021, representing one of the largest analyses of telehealth use trends among cancer patients to date. Among people receiving established, ongoing care during the study, it found that 39.4% took part in at least one telehealth visit, demonstrating the critical role telehealth has played in the care of patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Researchers note that the study demonstrates that patient satisfaction ratings for telehealth visits remained similar to satisfaction with in-person care.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital health tools provide in-between visit care for patients</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Haddad_Tufia_C._10120386_20220907-240x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378073" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Haddad_Tufia_C._10120386_20220907-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Haddad_Tufia_C._10120386_20220907.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tufia C. Haddad, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Beyond telehealth, the Mayo Clinic remote patient monitoring program is continuing to expand into the cancer space, allowing us to provide tablets and wearable devices for improved monitoring and in-between visit care," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/haddad-tufia-c-m-d/bio-20055534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tufia C. Haddad, M.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist and the study's senior author. "This will continue to help us understand how our patients are doing, how their symptoms and vital signs are tracking so that we can intervene earlier when things are not trending in a favorable direction."</p>



<p>With the many challenges of needing to get to and from appointments, telehealth has proved to be a worthy resource for many patients and their caregivers. The study showed that 52% of all visits by people undergoing treatment for various forms of brain cancer were conducted by video or phone technologies, demonstrating how access to care from home can be invaluable for many.</p>



<p>"The home is where healthcare happens," says Dr. Haddad. "Increasingly, we are seeing a continued shift in care to the home environment where smart homes enabled by digital technologies help assess and monitor patients. In the future, I think that will be more commonplace, and from there, we will only see the continued growth of virtual care delivery."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reimbursement structures may affect the future of telehealth growth</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers noted that 20% of the U.S. population lives and works in rural areas; however, only 3% of oncology practices provide care there. For those in rural areas finding it difficult to travel for cancer care, telehealth has proven to be a lifeline when available.</p>



<p>The study showed a significantly higher rate of phone visits in rural populations versus video visits. Dr. Pritchett says the increased use of telehealth through phone visits is encouraging and shows a willingness by rural patients with cancer to engage with telehealth overall.</p>



<p>However, he notes that with the end of the Public Health Emergency Declaration applied in response to COVID-19, there has been a decline in reimbursement for phone visits compared to video visits. This change has the potential to create a widening disparity between urban, suburban and rural residents, and shows a need for future studies to examine how to increase video visit use among rural populations, he says.</p>



<p>"Telehealth in cancer care isn't simply a byproduct of the pandemic response. Patients desire this type of care, and it has become an integral part of patient-centered cancer care that continues to evolve," says Dr. Pritchett. "I think a big takeaway from this work is going to be how we make sure that it continues to be equitable and accessible to patients, as well as sustainable for practices."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic researchers demonstrated a nearly 20% increase in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a> vaccination rates among adolescents through a combination intervention approach, a new Mayo Clinic study finds. The strategy involved mailing reminders to parents about their child's eligibility for the HPV vaccine and simultaneously giving healthcare providers feedback about successful HPV vaccine administration among the patients they had recently seen.</p>



<p>The findings, published in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2812161">JAMA Pediatrics</a>, suggest healthcare practices could adopt this evidence-based approach to boost HPV vaccination uptake in 11- and 12-year-olds.</p>



<p>"HPV vaccine uptake at 60% of eligible adolescents falls short of national public health goals and lags other adolescent vaccines," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/jacobson-robert-m-m-d/bio-00083020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Jacobson, M.D.</a>, a pediatrician in the Mayo Clinic Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. Dr. Jacobson is a co-principal investigator of the study.</p>



<p>Human papillomaviruses cause viral infections transmitted sexually through skin-to-skin contact. HPV infections may occur without symptoms or signs in late adolescence or early adulthood and affect both males and females. The virus can cause several types of cancers, including of the cervix, anus, genital area, mouth and throat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cases.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimates</a> 37,000 HPV-linked cancers occur each year in the U.S., all of which may be prevented by the HPV vaccination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the study, the researchers evaluated their intervention strategy at six Mayo Clinic primary care practices in Southeastern Minnesota. The investigation involved 9,242 adolescents who were due to receive at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. When parents received reminders in the mail and providers were simultaneously given feedback, 39.7% of patients got their doses due in the months that followed the interventions, as contrasted to 21.9% without the interventions.</p>



<p>“Our study investigated both parent- and provider-facing interventions. By targeting parents and providers, we achieved much higher improvements in HPV vaccine uptake than the use of these strategies in isolation,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rutten-lila-j-ph-d/bio-20551780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lila Finney Rutten, Ph.D.</a>, lead author and chair of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/quantitative-health-sciences/divisions/epidemiology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Division of Epidemiology</a>.</p>



<p>The researchers say the study not only addresses the low HPV vaccination rate but also holds the potential to reshape other public health and vaccination campaigns.</p>
