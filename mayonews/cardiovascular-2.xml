<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A recent Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542454823000814#appsec1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> examining the effects of daylight saving time (DST) on heart health suggests that the impact is likely minimal.</p>



<p>In the nationwide study, researchers applied an advanced statistical model to look for any connections between DST and serious cardiovascular problems, including heart attacks and strokes. The study looked at 36,116,951 adults aged 18 and up across most U.S. states. (Arizona and Hawaii were excluded since these states do not observe DST.)</p>



<p>Researchers focused on the week directly after the spring and fall DST transition, when clocks are set either an hour forward or backward.</p>



<p>"We looked at five years across the U.S., and what we found is that it’s unlikely that there is a clinically meaningful difference in cardiovascular health due to daylight saving time," says Benjamin Satterfield, M.D., Ph.D., a cardiovascular diseases fellow and lead author of the study.</p>



<p>Researchers found 74,722 adverse cardiovascular events occurred throughout the study during the spring and fall DST transition. An adverse cardiovascular event was documented when a person was hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiogenic-shock/symptoms-causes/syc-20366739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiogenic shock</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest</a>.</p>



<p>"These cardiovascular events are common health conditions, so this led to the question of whether this is more than would be expected if this had not followed the daylight saving time transition," says Dr. Satterfield.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The observance of daylight saving time <a href="https://www.nist.gov/image/world-time-zone-map" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">varies around the world</a>. Countries that move clocks forward or back one hour may do so on different dates, and some do not observe daylight saving time at all.</p>



<p>In the Mayo Clinic study, the Monday and Friday following the spring DST transition showed a statistically slight increase in the rates of cardiovascular events — but when looking at all the data, researchers did not see the rise as clinically significant, he said.</p>



<p>Researchers note that the time change practice was intended to align social and work activities with daylight hours and to conserve energy using less artificial lighting. They underscore that making changes to the DST system out of concern for heart health is unnecessary.</p>



<p>"When decisions are made about whether to abolish daylight saving time, there is no need to take concerns regarding heart health into account," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/gersh-bernard-j-m-b-ch-b-d-phil/bio-20053461?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bernard J. Gersh, M.B., Ch.B., D.Phil.</a>, cardiologist and senior author of the study.</p>



<p>Dr. Gersh and Dr. Satterfield note that the debate over DST includes other aspects of health. For example, Dr. Satterfield said researchers are exploring DST's effect on mental health and its effect on the rates of motor vehicle accidents.</p>

<p>Heart health is an essential part of your overall health and well-being. Your primary care provider will monitor your blood pressure and lab work during an annual physical exam or more frequently. If you have symptoms that indicate your heart may not be functioning properly, such as blood pressure higher than the recommended level, chest pain or swelling in your feet or legs, you may be <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/when-to-see-a-cardiologist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">referred to a cardiologist</a>.</p>



<p>A cardiologist uses diagnostic testing to evaluate the heart's ability to pump and move blood and oxygen throughout your body. Hearing you need a test on your heart may be confusing or scary, so understanding the purpose of the tests can help put you at ease.</p>



<p>Learn about various tests to help diagnose heart diseases and conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What's a cardiac stress test?</h2>



<p>A cardiac stress test shows how your heart works during physical activity. Also known as an exercise stress test, it can detect problems with blood flow when the heart is pumping faster and harder than usual. The test can be done while walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike. Or you may be given a drug to mimic the effects of exercise while in a seated, resting position.</p>



<p>You may have a stress test to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Diagnose if coronary artery disease, which is the buildup of cholesterol deposits or plaques, is causing damage or disease in your coronary arteries.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/racing-heart-beat-heart-arrhythmia-101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Identify arrhythmias</a> that cause your heart to beat too fast, slow, or irregularly.</li>



<li>Determine when to proceed with cardiac surgery or valve replacement treatments.</li>
</ul>



<p>A nuclear stress test may be recommended if an exercise stress test doesn't reveal the cause of your symptoms. During a nuclear stress test, short-lived radioactive medications are injected into the body and taken up by the heart to create an image of the heart's function at rest and with stress. This medication rapidly leaves the body after the test and is safe and painless.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What's a coronary CT angiogram?</h2>



<p>During a coronary CT angiogram, advanced CT technology and injected dye are used to take high-resolution 3D images of your heart. The 3D pictures of the beating heart and major blood vessels are used to identify coronary artery blockages. From the 3D images, your healthcare team can see if there are plaque or calcium deposits in the arteries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What's an echocardiogram?</h2>



<p>Sound waves produce images of your heart during an echocardiogram. This is a common test to see your heart beating and pumping blood. The images from an echocardiogram can help identify heart disease, detect congenital heart defects before birth and check for problems with the valves or chambers of your heart.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">You may have one of several types of echocardiograms:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Transthoracic<br></strong>The standard type of echocardiogram that converts sound wave echoes into moving images.</li>



<li><strong>Transesophageal</strong><br>Provides more detailed images than the standard echocardiogram.</li>



<li><strong>Doppler</strong><br>Can be used with transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiogram to measure the speed and direction of blood flow in your heart.</li>



<li><strong>Stress</strong><br>Ultrasound images of your heart before and after physical activity can be used to check for coronary artery problems.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What's an electrocardiogram?</h2>



<p>An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a noninvasive and painless way to quickly detect heart problems and monitor the heart health of people of all ages. You may have an ECG if you have symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, confusion, heart palpitations or shortness of breath.</p>



<p>Small, adhesive electrodes are attached to your chest, arms and legs during an ECG. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your heart, and the ECG machine prints out a chart of your heart's electrical signals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">An ECG can be used to diagnose many common heart problems and may detect:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Arrhythmias or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/is-it-love-or-atrial-fibrillation">abnormal heart rhythm</a></li>



<li>Blocked or narrowed arteries in your heart or coronary artery disease</li>



<li>If you have had a previous heart attack</li>
</ul>



<p>Continuous ECG monitoring may be recommended if your symptoms come and go, which causes difficulty with a standard ECG test.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The two types of remote or continuous monitors are:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Holter<br></strong>A small device you can wear records 24 to 48 hours of continuous ECG monitoring.</li>



<li><strong>Event</strong><br>A portable device that records heart electrical signals for a few minutes at a time, typically over the course of 30 days.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What you can do to prepare for a heart test</h2>



<p>Preparing for diagnostic heart tests helps ensure the results are accurate. Talk with your healthcare team about your questions when preparing for the test recommended specifically for your symptoms.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Here are a few general steps you can take before a heart test:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Notify your care team of prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/do-supplements-help-or-hurt-gut-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supplements or herbal products</a> you are taking. Your heart can be affected by some medicines. Your healthcare team will tell you if adjustments are needed to your medications for the test.</li>



<li>You may need to fast before specific tests. This means you may have to avoid food or beverages before the test. Your healthcare team will give you detailed fasting instructions if necessary.</li>



<li>Wear loose, comfortable clothing that allows access to your chest, arms and legs. You may need to wear a hospital gown during the test. Avoid applying lotion, oil or powder to your skin before specific tests, like an ECG.</li>



<li>Limit strenuous activity that may elevate your heart rate for a few hours before the test. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/what-are-hidden-sources-of-caffeine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consuming caffeine</a> or nicotine before some tests can affect your heart rate and interfere with the results.</li>



<li>Some tests require sedation or other medicine to help you relax. This can affect your ability to drive after the test, so you need to arrange a ride to and from the healthcare facility.</li>



<li>Follow specific instructions from your healthcare team.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The fall</strong></h2>



<p>It was Good Friday 2023. Mark Forbess was just leaving <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> after his first appointment as a new patient at the heart failure program, when everything went black.</p>



<p>"I found myself on the pavement in front of Mayo Clinic," says Mark. "I was emerging from unconsciousness. Everything was dark. I opened my eyes to see that my face was pressed onto the hot, black pavement."</p>



<p>People nearby ran to his aid as he experienced excruciating pain in his head, back and neck. From there, he was rushed to the emergency department in the building he was just leaving.</p>



<p>Mark had experienced a devastating heart electrical event.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where it all began</strong></h2>



<p>At around 33 years old, Mark was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)</a>, a disease in which the heart muscle becomes thickened. The thickened heart muscle makes it harder for the heart to pump blood.</p>



<p>"Over time, my heart health began to decline," says Mark. "The heart failure turned into devastating episodes of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation (AFib)</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ventricular-tachycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355138?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ventricular tachycardia (V-tach)</a>. During this time, I experienced four V-tach episodes which required my <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/about/pac-20384692?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)</a> to bring me back to life, in addition to eight cardiac ablations."</p>



<p>In the fall of 2022, he was referred to Mayo Clinic for a PET scan to look for other heart diseases. At the time, nothing was found that met Mayo Clinic's heart failure treatment criteria, so he was not approved as a cardiology patient. However, in March of 2023, after experiencing congestive heart failure while being treated at another medical institution, he was referred to Mayo Clinic again as a candidate for the heart failure program.</p>



<p>The following month, he was approved for the program under the care of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lyle-melissa-a-m-d/bio-20491562?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Melissa Lyle, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A candidate for transplant</strong></h2>



<p>After the emergency department triage, Mark recalls his cardiologist saying, "Congratulations, Mr. Forbess. You just won a ticket to be evaluated for the heart transplant program." From there, he went through a battery of evaluation tests, which he passed, officially allowing him access to Mayo Clinic's heart transplant program.</p>



<p>"I knew that when Dr. Lyle told me I was entered into the Mayo Clinic heart transplant program that God was in total control of my life," says Mark. "He was guiding her and providing the confidence, from years of training, that I could live a happy life again by having a new heart."</p>



<p>Within a month, Mark was admitted to Mayo Clinic and waitlisted for his new heart. Transplant patients are ranked by necessity, and due to his condition, he was at the top of the list.</p>



<p>Mark had a rare heart deformation in which his left ventricle was very enlarged. This is considered unusual in HCM patients because their heart walls are usually very thick and the ventricles are small. As a result, Mark became eligible for a cardiac device — a small heart pump that helped improve his oxygen blood levels while he waited for his heart transplant.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Daytona 500 meets the ICU</strong></h2>



<p>In an effort to lift the spirits of their patients and encourage some much-needed exercise, the nurses on Mark's floor came up with some competitive fun.</p>



<p>"These patients are not your typical ICU patients," says Sara Vilela, registered nurse. "They are often walking and talking, something we are not used to in the ICU. This means we have to make sure we are catering to this special patient population and ensuring that not only their medical needs are being taken care of, but also their social needs."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="523" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Transplant_Games-1024x523.png" alt="" class="wp-image-382339" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Transplant_Games-1024x523.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Transplant_Games-300x153.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Transplant_Games-768x392.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Transplant_Games-1536x784.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Transplant_Games.png 1788w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mark and fellow cardiac ICU playing dominoes</figcaption></figure>



<p>The nursing staff set up a series of games from dominoes to a "Cardiac Device 500" footrace between patients around the hospital unit, measured by the distance they walked each day.</p>



<p>"It was a bit of a leap to think playing games at a time like this was appropriate," says Mark. "After all, we were in the ICU. When you showed up and participated, you were hooked. It was that much fun and necessary. No medical tests, no medicine and no bad news. Nothing but fun, and that’s always good for the soul. I participated in afternoon game sessions with other heart transplant patients, their families, my brother Jeff and the outstanding Mayo nursing staff. We looked forward to the opportunity to meet each other and focus our minds on something we had in common and away from our current health status."</p>



<p>The games were a big hit among the patients, inspiring much creativity, especially the races. They created names for their cardiac devices, team logos and even fake sponsors. Mark named his heart pump "Archie," after his father.</p>

<p>Mark recalls being barely able to walk a small lap at the beginning of this journey. However, walking more and more each day, motivated by a new heart and some friendly competition, he began walking about five to seven miles a day, even hitting a heart pump record of 10.8 miles.</p>



<p>"By hosting game times, these patients were able to talk to one another about the struggles of waiting for a heart transplant, but also the triumphs, such as beating their previous day's record of laps," says Vilela. "They connected over this unique experience and bond with one another, which resulted in a patient population encouraging each other, remembering they are not alone on this journey."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inspired by memories</strong></h2>



<p>Mark lost his wife of nearly 40 years, Michele, in June 2022, approximately 10 months before entering Mayo Clinic on the heart transplant waitlist.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-382338" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/Mark_Piano_1x1.jpg 1512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>


<p>"I had spent many days grieving in the Mayo atrium over my wife," he says. "I wanted to change that to positive, fun memories instead by providing a little entertainment playing the beautiful grand piano and maybe brighten someone else's day." He pursued the opportunity to play with the encouragement of one of his nurses, Frances Ausley, and Rose Grace from the Humanities in Medicine Department. Grace is a concert level pianist herself who occasionally visited Mark in his hospital room to play the keyboard.</p>



<p>"Frances Ausley has incredible capabilities and a very hard work ethic while providing care to all those around her," Mark says. "Rose Grace encouraged me and gave me the confidence that I could play the piano under these circumstances."</p>



<p>While playing the piano helped, he still found himself battling anxiety and sadness around the anniversary of losing his wife.</p>



<p>"Managing anxiety on the one-year anniversary of my wife's passing was going to be very difficult," Mark says. "Wanting to celebrate her life outside, I was stuck in the ICU waiting for a heart, knowing that any high anxiety could trigger severe heart arrhythmia. Carolina Robles de Brady, a wonderful and thoughtful nurse from El Salvador, secretly arranged to reenact the dinner my wife and I had made on our first date — chicken cordon bleu with blueberry fluff as dessert. She asked me the day before about memories of a favorite dinner with my wife. I was pleasantly surprised as Carolina kept me calm while we celebrated my wife's life."</p>



<p>Later on, Mark would nominate Carolina for a DAISY Award, honoring nurses who go above and beyond to provide compassionate care to patients and families. She was selected and recognized with the award in December 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new heart, a new day, a new future</strong></h2>



<p>On July 14, 2023, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/goswami-rohan-m-m-d/bio-20432467?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Rohan Goswami</a> entered Mark's room. Expecting another donor update, the news was different this time. "I found you the perfect heart," Mark recalls Dr. Goswami saying.</p>



<p>"I never had children, but I’m guessing this is one of the most exciting pieces of medical news you could ever receive," says Mark. "After several months of waiting, Dr. Goswami is telling me I have a heart coming. It was an unbelievable experience. The sacrifice a donor family makes to give organs to another human being is one of the greatest acts of unselfishness and kindness a person can do on this earth. It's real, and it's effective. My donor family will be forever in my soul as I wake up every day thanking them in my prayers."</p>

<p>Mark received his new heart on July 17, 2023.</p>



<p>After more than 30 years as an investment banker, Mark started thinking about a long-term career goal he'd always wanted to pursue. Since childhood, he wanted to be a screenwriter and filmmaker.</p>



<p>"Before I entered the hospital for my transplant, I purchased screenwriters professional software used to write film scripts and loaded it onto my computer," says Mark. "I always wanted to produce films that would help people find true, long-term happiness in life. If I could write one particular story while waiting for my heart transplant, I would be a happy person myself."</p>



<p>Since leaving the hospital, he has achieved this goal by completing his first screenplay and has begun the process of marketing it to the film industry. As for his health journey, he continues to excel at cardiac rehabilitation, lowering medications every month as his recovery progresses.</p>



<p>Paying regular visits to Mayo Clinic staff since his transplant, Mark acknowledges that everyone he met while waiting for his transplant helped make his experience a good one.</p>



<p>"During this time, I would meet many incredible nurses, doctors, physician assistants, housekeeping team members, Food Services team members and a host of other personnel who took great pride in their roles," says Mark.</p>



<p>His interactions with all staff, even beyond his hospital room, became an expansion of his care team. Many share that Mark had just as much of an impact on them.</p>



<p>"The power of food and how it changes the patient experience by broadening the scope of meal service providing comfort, connection and nutrition is a component of their care," says Casey Wingerter, patient ambassador for Mayo Clinic Food Services. "During Mark's stay at Mayo, meals became a medium for connection, and connection was&nbsp;critical for his transplant journey. He healed while at Mayo, and it was the people that made the difference. That human connection is what he held on to and is why he became a bright spot in our staff's days as well."</p>



<p>Mark recalls how much Wingerter and her team truly made a difference. Before he left the hospital, he says the Food Services team gifted him a small suitcase full of his favorite gum as a way of saying thank you from Wingerter and the Food Services team.</p>



<p>"I firmly believe God answers our prayers," says Mark. "My hope is that my testimony can serve as a powerful tool for you to convey the profound significance of God in our lives. His presence can guide us through seemingly impossible challenges, which will lead to a truly long-term, happy life."</p>

<p>Eau Claire, Wis. — Detecting a heart murmur on your own can be tricky. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-murmurs/basics/definition/con-20028706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">murmur</a>&nbsp;is an extra heart sound that can be heard by a stethoscope.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a murmur sounds like a humming sound, which can be faint or loud. It might be temporary or persistent. Heart murmurs may be present at birth or develop later in life during pregnancy, phases of rapid growth like adolescence, or from a fever or anemia.</p>



<p>"The murmur may disappear as quickly as it comes if it has a temporary cause," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/michel-barsoum-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michel Barsoum, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/cardiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/vascular-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vascular medicine</a> specialist at Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/chippewa-falls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chippewa Falls</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eau Claire</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/rice-lake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rice Lake</a>, Wisconsin. "However, a murmur also could be persistent and loud, easily heard, and sound like a churning mill wheel or cooing seagull. This might indicate a serious heart problem."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What causes a heart murmur?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Several factors can cause a murmur. It could be a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-valve-disease/basics/definition/con-20036065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart valve problem</a>&nbsp;or a hole in the heart.</p>



<p>The valves in your heart act as doors between the chambers, or rooms, of the heart. In the case of a murmur, a valve may be tight or leaky. When heart valves are narrow, this is called stenosis. A murmur also could be from a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/treating-mitral-valve-regurgitation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaky valve</a>, called regurgitation.</p>



<p>A murmur also may occur from high blood flow in people with a fever or with low red blood cells, called anemia.</p>



<p>Some people have a family history of heart murmur and heart disease. Some are born with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/genetic-testing-and-cardiac-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congenital condition</a> causing a murmur. Others have had a recent severe infection or illness that could damage a heart valve and need immediate medical attention.</p>



<p>Innocent or harmless heart murmurs don't typically cause symptoms, and most heart murmurs aren't serious.</p>



<p>Symptoms of a serious or worrisome heart murmur depend on the cause and require evaluation by a healthcare professional.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>These heart murmur symptoms may include:</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Blue or gray lips or fingernails</li>



<li>Chest pain</li>



<li>Fainting</li>



<li>Fever</li>



<li>Leg swelling</li>



<li>Lingering cough</li>



<li>Shortness of breath</li>



<li>Sudden weight gain</li>



<li>Swollen liver or neck veins</li>



<li>Worsening fatigue</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How is a heart murmur diagnosed?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>It's common for a heart murmur to be detected during a physical exam being given for another reason. If a healthcare professional hears a murmur, you'll be asked questions about your personal and family history that could indicate a reason for the murmur.</p>



<p>Several criteria are used to determine if a murmur is innocent or worrisome, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Volume<br></strong>The loudness of the heart murmur is evaluated on a scale from 1 to 6. The loudest heart murmur is a 6.</li>



<li><strong>Location<br></strong>The location of the murmur in the heart will be identified, along with determining if the sound spreads to the neck or back.</li>



<li><strong>Pitch<br></strong>The heart murmur may have a high, medium or low pitch.</li>



<li><strong>Timing<br></strong>A heart murmur that occurs when blood leaves the heart is a systolic murmur. A murmur that occurs when the heart fills with blood is called a diastolic murmur. A murmur also may be heard throughout the heartbeat. When the murmur is heard as blood passes through the heart, it may be a sign of a larger heart problem.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>You will need to undergo testing to determine the cause of the heart murmur. Your healthcare professional likely will order an ultrasound picture of your heart, called an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/basics/definition/prc-20013918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>,&nbsp;or echo, to show detailed images of your heart's valves, chambers, structure and function.</p>



<p>"Once the cause of a heart murmur has been found, some people will need repeated evaluation over the years," says Dr. Barsoum. "It's important to find the cause so the right treatment can be determined."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Too often, the first sign of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a> may be a major event like a heart attack, stroke or cardiac arrest. Now, researchers and clinicians at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> are using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to flag heart problems earlier, boosting the abilities of a diagnostic test that has been around for over a century — the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram (ECG)</a>.   </p>



<p>Early detection of heart disease can make a significant difference in a patient's quality of life and longevity, but a lack of defining symptoms adds complexity. The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ai-cardiology/overview/ovc-20486648?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-enabled ECG</a> provides a way to potentially detect heart disease earlier and track disease progression using a test that is relatively inexpensive, readily available and often already part of a patient's electronic health record.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has developed ECG-AI algorithms that are currently used in research to predict a patient's likelihood of having heart conditions like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a>, amyloidosis, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-stenosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353139?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aortic stenosis</a>, low ejection fraction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and more. The AI can also predict a patient's biological age using traditional 12-lead and single-lead ECGs from smartwatches and portable devices.</p>



<p>One standout application is the use of ECG-AI to detect low ejection fraction, commonly called a weak heart pump. The 12-lead algorithm for detecting this condition is cleared for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and licensed to <a href="https://anumana.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anumana</a>. A single-lead algorithm for handheld devices externally applied to the chest is licensed to <a href="https://www.ekohealth.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eko Health</a> for commercial development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Diagnosing a weak heart pump</h2>



<p>Approximately 3% of Americans have a treatable condition called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/expert-answers/ejection-fraction/faq-20058286?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low ejection fraction</a>, where the heart is weakened and pumps less blood out to the body. The underlying causes and symptoms are often treatable, but people may not be aware of their condition until symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue and swelling in their legs start to get worse. Left untreated, low ejection fraction can progress to worsening <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>, affecting quality of life and potentially become severe enough to require a heart transplant or lead to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the symptoms of a weak heart pump can be confused with those seen with normal pregnancy. At Mayo Clinic in Florida, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20507418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demilade Adedinsewo, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a cardiologist, uses AI as a tool to detect a condition in women called peripartum <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiomyopathy</a>, a weak heart pump that can develop during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. Heart muscle weakness can be predicted with AI from a traditional 12-lead ECG and from an AI-enabled digital stethoscope that captures single-lead ECG and heart sound recordings.</p>



<p>"Our research with obstetric patients in Nigeria suggests that portable technology like the AI-enabled digital stethoscope has the potential to flag twice as many cases of peripartum cardiomyopathy as compared to routine care," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "It may be a powerful tool to bring portable cardiomyopathy diagnostics to more women in underserved urban and rural populations around the world. Access is an important consideration in addressing health disparities in the U.S., because Black women have up to a sixteenfold greater risk of developing peripartum cardiomyopathy, compared to white women."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Amyloid buildup in the heart</h2>



<p>Amyloidosis is a rare disease of misfolded proteins that go astray to form deposits of amyloid in organs, nerves and tissues. There are several different types, but when enough <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiac-amyloidosis-clinic/overview/ovc-20508423?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amyloid builds up in the heart</a>, it causes heart failure and symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid buildup and fainting. Patients also can have heart rhythm problems and might need a pacemaker. Early diagnosis is critical because, while amyloidosis is not curable, it is treatable with new medical therapies that can dramatically reduce the amount of amyloid produced and stop disease progression.</p>



<p>Using ECG-AI, clinicians at Mayo Clinic can potentially flag patients who are in the early stages of cardiac amyloidosis. The technology is used in research and has FDA breakthrough device designation.</p>



<p>"We've done some research indicating that, if we apply artificial intelligence just to the electrocardiogram, we can suggest if the patient has the diagnosis, often before a clinician has even suspected it. So we believe that this is a way to make an early diagnosis," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grogan-martha-m-d/bio-20053492?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martha Grogan, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "Now, it has to be put in clinical context. It's not just that one AI ECG, but it can really help us suspect amyloidosis."</p>



<p>"It's a very powerful tool because it's inexpensive. It's available almost everywhere. Our research showed that even a single lead, which is something that you could do on a watch or a simple mobile device, can give us this prediction of amyloidosis," says Dr. Grogan. "So, one could imagine that, in underserved populations throughout the world, a simple ECG might help determine if a patient has amyloidosis, especially in those high-risk groups."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a> is one of the most common genetic heart diseases, affecting 1 in 200 to 500 people. HCM happens when the heart's walls become thicker over time, which can disrupt the heart's electrical signals, increasing the risk of sudden cardiac death. Unfortunately, people often don't notice any symptoms until the disease progresses. It's like having a silent intruder in your heart.</p>



<p>Early detection is crucial but challenging. HCM does not always show up on basic tests, such as a 12-lead ECG. Most patients would not be referred to more resource-intensive tests, like an echocardiogram or MRI, unless a problem was suspected. But ECG-AI can spot HCM by recognizing subtle patterns that even expert clinicians might miss.</p>



<p>"Applying this AI algorithm to routine ECGs shows promise as a means to make early detection of HCM more practical, accurate and accessible as part of a heart health checkup," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/siontis-konstantinos-m-d/bio-20503925?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Konstantinos Siontis, M.D.</a>, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. "Athletes with yet undiagnosed HCM, who may be more at risk of dangerous arrhythmias during exercise, could benefit from early detection. And because HCM often runs in families, detecting it early in one person can lead to identifying other family members at risk."</p>

<p>When amyloid collects in the heart muscle, it causes thickening of the heart wall and disrupts heart function. It reduces the heart's ability to fill with blood between heartbeats, resulting in less blood being pumped with each beat and higher pressures in the heart chambers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The heart is the most important abnormality in amyloidosis because if the heart is affected, that is the complete driver of how the patient will do and what their prognosis is," says Dr. Grogan. "That's why cardiac amyloidosis is so important to recognize and treat as early as possible."</p>



<p>Three types of amyloids can affect the heart:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Light chain amyloid</strong> is produced in the bone marrow, progresses quickly and has the worst prognosis.</li>



<li><strong>Wild-type transthyretin amyloid (TTR)</strong> is produced in the liver and is the most common. This type typically shows up in men over 60, however women may also develop this condition.</li>



<li><strong>Hereditary type transthyretin amyloid </strong>is caused by a gene mutation and is considered rare, except in Black Americans. Not everyone with the gene variation will get the condition.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"The key thing, once a clinician suspects amyloid, is that it's a medical emergency."</h2>



<p>Dr. Grogan says amyloidosis is tricky to diagnose. At first, there are no symptoms. Later, the symptoms often imitate other conditions.</p>



<p>"We need to get to the bottom of: Does the patient really have amyloidosis or not? And then after, we do a series of tests. We need to figure out for sure what type of amyloid it is. We can't be guessing at what type because the treatment completely depends on the type," says Dr. Grogan.</p>



<p>For light chain amyloidosis, treatment is directed at the bone marrow and may include chemotherapy or stem cell transplant with a patient's own cells. Treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis aims to stabilize or reduce the amount of amyloid being produced from the liver.</p>



<p>There are current clinical trials of medication that will try to actively take the amyloid out of the heart, but they're not yet approved. However, Dr. Grogan says the future looks bright.</p>



<p>"These new medications are very exciting. In fact, that area of amyloidosis research is truly an explosion, there is so much going on. We went from very few options to so many options. We need to keep testing these and studying these," says Dr. Grogan.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know your numbers: What is your heart rate?</h2>



<p>Your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. Your resting heart rate is when the heart is pumping the lowest amount of blood you need because you're not exercising. If you're sitting or lying down ― and you're calm, relaxed and aren't sick ― your heart rate is typically between 60 and 100 beats per minute.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Other factors that can affect your heart rate include:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Air temperature.</strong> When <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/effects-of-high-temperatures-on-blood-pressure-heart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temperatures or humidity increases</a>, the heart pumps more blood, so your pulse or heart rate may increase.</li>



<li><strong>Body position.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes, when going from sitting to standing, your pulse may go up a little. After a few minutes, it should return to a typical rate.</li>



<li><strong>Emotions.</strong>&nbsp;If you're stressed, anxious or incredibly happy, your emotions can raise your heart rate.</li>



<li><strong>Body size.</strong>&nbsp;Body size usually does not increase your heart rate. However, if you're obese, you may have a higher resting heart rate.</li>



<li><strong>Medication use.</strong>&nbsp;Medications that block adrenaline tend to slow your heart rate. Thyroid medication may raise it.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why your heart rate matters</h3>



<p>Cardiovascular exercise, also called cardio or aerobic exercise, keeps you and your heart healthy. This specific type of exercise gets your heart rate up and your heart beating faster for several minutes. Cardiovascular exercise helps strengthen your heart, allowing it to pump blood more efficiently and improving blood flow to all parts of your body. It also boosts your high-density lipoprotein (or HDL), or "good" <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/know-your-numbers-cholesterol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>, and lowers your low-density lipoprotein (or LDL), or "bad" cholesterol. This may result in less buildup of plaque in your arteries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What's your target heart rate?</h2>



<p>Your target heart rate is the minimum heart rate you need to maintain in a given amount of time to reach the energy level necessary to give your heart a good workout. To find your target heart rate to maximize your cardiovascular exercise, the first step is determining your maximum heart rate.</p>



<p>Your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age. Your target heart rate for moderate to vigorous exercise is about 50%–85% of your maximum heart rate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Averages by age as a general guide are:</h3>



<ul>
<li>20: 100–170 beats per minute</li>



<li>30: 95–162 beats per minute</li>



<li>35: 93–157 beats per minute</li>



<li>40: 90–153 beats per minute</li>



<li>45: 88–149 beats per minute</li>



<li>50: 85–145 beats per minute</li>



<li>55: 83–140 beats per minute</li>



<li>60: 80–136 beats per minute</li>



<li>65: 78–132 beats per minute</li>



<li>70: 75–128 beats per minute</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What you can do</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Start slow.</strong>&nbsp;If you are beginning an exercise program, aim for the lower end of your target heart rate zone and then gradually build up intensity.</li>



<li><strong>Try interval training.</strong> <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/interval-training-for-heart-health/">Interval training</a>, which includes short bursts ― 15–60 seconds ― of higher-intensity exercise, alternated with longer, less strenuous exercise, effectively increases cardiovascular fitness. Talk with your healthcare team before trying interval training, but it is typically safe for those with existing heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.</li>



<li><strong>Take the "talk test."</strong>&nbsp;If you can carry on a conversation in brief sentences while exercising, you're probably in the moderate intensity range. You'll be breathing faster, developing a light sweat and feeling some muscle strain. If you're working at a vigorous intensity, you won't be able to say more than a few words without catching your breath. If you can sing while working out, you're probably in the low-intensity range, so step it up.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know your numbers</h2>



<p>Many wearable activity trackers can&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/how-to-take-pulse/art-20482581" target="_blank">monitor your heart rate</a>&nbsp;when you exercise and periodically throughout the day. If you don't have an activity tracker, you can use the radial artery in your wrist or the carotid artery in your neck. If you have heart disease or long-standing diabetes, it's best to use the artery on your wrist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To find your heart rate manually:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Locate the artery you will use to find your heart rate.</li>



<li>Using the tips of your first two fingers, press lightly over the artery.</li>



<li>Count your heartbeats for 30 seconds and multiply by two to find your total beats per minute.</li>
</ul>



<p>If your heart rate is too high, take it easier. If it's too low, add some intensity and push yourself to get your heart rate closer to your target.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Abnormal heart rate</h3>



<p>If you experience irregular heartbeats, including a racing heartbeat, slow heartbeat or a feeling of fluttering in your chest, you may be experiencing a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/racing-heart-beat-heart-arrhythmia-101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart arrhythmia</a>. Heart rhythm or heartbeat problems can occur when the electrical impulses that coordinate your heartbeats don't work properly, causing your heart to beat too fast, slow or irregularly. Talk with your healthcare team if you have heart rhythm concerns.</p>

<p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken, making it harder to pump blood and sometimes causing an irregular heart rhythm.</p>



<p>"So right now, what we think in the United States, we've only diagnosed 1/7 of the people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So we're trying to increase the awareness in the community about this disease," says Dr. Alsidawi.</p>



<p>He says patients are born with a genetic mutation. The disease can start at a young age or later in life — many times with no symptoms.&nbsp; </p>



<p>"We know the patients that we lose to this condition, the majority of them are young, active and athletes. So high-level athletic exercise can put you at higher risk of sudden cardiac death," says Dr. Alsidawi.</p>



<p>He says it's important to seek medical attention if you have any symptoms, especially with exertion, "including shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheaded, dizzy or passing out."</p>



<p>If diagnosed, the good news is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be treated with medications, surgery, implanting a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/about/pac-20384692?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defibrillator</a> that monitors the heart or, in severe cases, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart transplantation</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Justin Pomeroy, 23, struggled after a weight training session, he wasn’t sure if he was simply fatigued or experiencing a medical crisis. While lifting weights, one of his shoulders popped, followed by radiating pain.</p>



<p>Despite being fit for his active job as a Florida-based U.S. Coast Guard crewman, he continued to feel debilitating weakness, even when making the slightest of movements.</p>



<p>His condition worsened over the next few days to the point that he went to the emergency department, where he learned he had numerous blood clots. Justin later came to learn that his struggle after weight training was an early warning sign of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353988">thoracic outlet syndrome</a>, also known as TOS.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seeking answers</strong></h2>



<p>Justin saw a physician who ran tests that indicated a blood clotting disorder. It was quickly identified that he had a predisposition to clotting due to a genetic blood mutation.</p>



<p>"At the time, I wasn't aware of how serious the situation was," Justin says. "Honestly, the whole time while in the hospital, I was more concerned about what work I was missing."</p>



<p>The discovery of blood clots, which were treated with anticoagulant medication, was just the beginning of Justin's ordeal. The Coast Guardsman who had been in excellent health would spend the next 18 months trying to discover why he had grown so weak that he couldn’t perform his job without stopping to rest.</p>



<p>"My arm had swollen to such a size that it had become unmanageable," Justin says. "I was in aviation, and it created a situation where I was grounded and not flying anymore."</p>



<p>More testing and bloodwork revealed that, in addition to the clotting disorder, Justin had TOS, a rare disorder that involves compression of the nerves, arteries or veins in the lower neck and upper chest.</p>



<p>"I was medically retired from the Coast Guard," Justin says. "It was devastating because that was my career path, and it was something I really wanted to do."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A 'nagging feeling'</strong></h2>



<p>Although disappointed to leave a job he loved, Justin didn’t stop looking for answers.</p>



<p>"I'm the type of person who likes to leave no stone left unturned, and I had this nagging feeling that more could be done to improve my situation," he says.</p>



<p>His search for answers led him to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, wanting to see a team familiar with TOS diagnoses. Diagnosing thoracic outlet syndrome is complex because symptoms vary greatly and often can be indicators of other health problems — making it a difficult condition to pin down. Because there are multiple types of TOS, forming the correct diagnosis is key to successful treatment.</p>



<p>Justin got in to see Justin Yarbrough, nurse practitioner, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/farres-sam-m-d/bio-20055440">Dr. Sam Farres,</a> chief of the Vascular Surgery Division. Justin says as he told them his story, the care team listened closely, asking questions and sharing information. "There was just a wealth of knowledge," says Justin. "I thought, they're going to help me find some answers."</p>



<p>The Mayo team ran tests and imaging studies that other facilities didn't do, Justin says, revealing he actually had two types of thoracic outlet syndrome — neurogenic and vascular. After trying conservative treatment approaches with mixed success, Justin and his care team made the decision together to schedule him for a rib resection surgery in September 2023.</p>



<p>"They didn't want to rush in and push me to have surgery," he says. "They really wanted to make sure we were doing the right thing for my specific situation."</p>



<p>He was amazed to find that shortly after surgery, he could be active again. But it wasn't just the outcome of his surgery that impressed him. Justin was overwhelmed by the care team's proficiency and level of attention throughout his journey.</p>



<p>"It was mind-blowing to show up to a medical appointment and they are already in the room waiting for you," he says. "They tried to get a very nuanced understanding of my condition, and if I asked a question, it was answered."</p>



<p>Today, Justin says he's pain-free and has greater mobility, allowing him to get back to activities he loves, like fishing on the open water.</p>



<p>"That's great news for me," he says, "but not-so-great news for the fish."</p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. — With those New Year's resolutions six weeks behind us, some people may have reverted to less healthy ways of eating. Heart Month is a great time to remind yourself why a healthy diet is important for more than just your waistline.</p>



<p>"What you eat and drink affects your cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and if you have high cholesterol or triglyceride levels, your healthcare team may recommend following a cholesterol-lowering diet," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/ripu-singh-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripu Singh, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/cardiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> at Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mankato</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/waseca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waseca</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High cholesterol</a>&nbsp;could cause your heart arteries to harden, a condition called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atherosclerosis</a>, which&nbsp;could lead to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>. In addition, hardened arteries may allow a coating called plaque to build up and partially block your arteries. Blocked arteries can lead to low blood flow in the heart and chest pain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are triglycerides and cholesterol?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Triglycerides and cholesterol are types of lipids, or fats, which circulate in your blood. Triglycerides store unused calories and provide your body with energy. Cholesterol is used to build cells and certain hormones.</p>



<p>Cholesterol is made mainly by the liver but can also can enter your body in the foods you eat that contain animal fat. Foods that come from animals or contain animal fat include meat, egg yolks, lard and dairy products. The type and amount of fat you eat can influence how much cholesterol your body makes.</p>



<p>Your body makes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/triglycerides/art-20048186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triglycerides</a>&nbsp;from excess calories, regardless of the calorie source, such as fat, protein or carbohydrates. Triglycerides also are made from excess sugar and alcohol. High triglyceride levels are a risk factor for heart disease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lifestyle choices for improving your levels</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Your healthcare team may recommend some of these lifestyle changes to improve your blood cholesterol levels and lower your triglyceride level:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Eat a plant-based diet.</strong><br>Eat more high-fiber foods from plants. Choose 100% whole grains, whole fruits and vegetables.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Get to and stay at a healthy body weight.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Limit or avoid trans fats.</strong><br>Trans fats can raise blood cholesterol.</li>



<li><strong>Limit your intake of high-cholesterol foods.</strong><br>Reduce consumption of foods like egg yolks, organ meats, animal fat and high-fat dairy.</li>



<li><strong>Lower your total fat intake.</strong><br>All oils and fats are high in calories.</li>



<li><strong>Lower your saturated fat intake.</strong><br>Saturated fat can raise blood cholesterol.</li>



<li><strong>Replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats.</strong><br>Unsaturated fats can lower your blood cholesterol levels. Monounsaturated fats are preferred. Polyunsaturated fats are OK.</li>
</ul>



<p>"You can still enjoy foods you love, but you should prioritize a heart-healthy diet and eat less-healthy foods in moderation. Small changes can make a big impact in reducing your risk of heart disease," says Dr. Singh.</p>
