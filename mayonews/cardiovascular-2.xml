<p>When amyloid collects in the heart muscle, it causes thickening of the heart wall and disrupts heart function. It reduces the heart's ability to fill with blood between heartbeats, resulting in less blood being pumped with each beat and higher pressures in the heart chambers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The heart is the most important abnormality in amyloidosis because if the heart is affected, that is the complete driver of how the patient will do and what their prognosis is," says Dr. Grogan. "That's why cardiac amyloidosis is so important to recognize and treat as early as possible."</p>



<p>Three types of amyloids can affect the heart:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Light chain amyloid</strong> is produced in the bone marrow, progresses quickly and has the worst prognosis.</li>



<li><strong>Wild-type transthyretin amyloid (TTR)</strong> is produced in the liver and is the most common. This type typically shows up in men over 60, however women may also develop this condition.</li>



<li><strong>Hereditary type transthyretin amyloid </strong>is caused by a gene mutation and is considered rare, except in Black Americans. Not everyone with the gene variation will get the condition.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"The key thing, once a clinician suspects amyloid, is that it's a medical emergency."</h2>



<p>Dr. Grogan says amyloidosis is tricky to diagnose. At first, there are no symptoms. Later, the symptoms often imitate other conditions.</p>



<p>"We need to get to the bottom of: Does the patient really have amyloidosis or not? And then after, we do a series of tests. We need to figure out for sure what type of amyloid it is. We can't be guessing at what type because the treatment completely depends on the type," says Dr. Grogan.</p>



<p>For light chain amyloidosis, treatment is directed at the bone marrow and may include chemotherapy or stem cell transplant with a patient's own cells. Treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis aims to stabilize or reduce the amount of amyloid being produced from the liver.</p>



<p>There are current clinical trials of medication that will try to actively take the amyloid out of the heart, but they're not yet approved. However, Dr. Grogan says the future looks bright.</p>



<p>"These new medications are very exciting. In fact, that area of amyloidosis research is truly an explosion, there is so much going on. We went from very few options to so many options. We need to keep testing these and studying these," says Dr. Grogan.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know your numbers: What is your heart rate?</h2>



<p>Your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. Your resting heart rate is when the heart is pumping the lowest amount of blood you need because you're not exercising. If you're sitting or lying down ― and you're calm, relaxed and aren't sick ― your heart rate is typically between 60 and 100 beats per minute.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Other factors that can affect your heart rate include:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Air temperature.</strong> When <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/effects-of-high-temperatures-on-blood-pressure-heart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temperatures or humidity increases</a>, the heart pumps more blood, so your pulse or heart rate may increase.</li>



<li><strong>Body position.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes, when going from sitting to standing, your pulse may go up a little. After a few minutes, it should return to a typical rate.</li>



<li><strong>Emotions.</strong>&nbsp;If you're stressed, anxious or incredibly happy, your emotions can raise your heart rate.</li>



<li><strong>Body size.</strong>&nbsp;Body size usually does not increase your heart rate. However, if you're obese, you may have a higher resting heart rate.</li>



<li><strong>Medication use.</strong>&nbsp;Medications that block adrenaline tend to slow your heart rate. Thyroid medication may raise it.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why your heart rate matters</h3>



<p>Cardiovascular exercise, also called cardio or aerobic exercise, keeps you and your heart healthy. This specific type of exercise gets your heart rate up and your heart beating faster for several minutes. Cardiovascular exercise helps strengthen your heart, allowing it to pump blood more efficiently and improving blood flow to all parts of your body. It also boosts your high-density lipoprotein (or HDL), or "good" <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/know-your-numbers-cholesterol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>, and lowers your low-density lipoprotein (or LDL), or "bad" cholesterol. This may result in less buildup of plaque in your arteries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What's your target heart rate?</h2>



<p>Your target heart rate is the minimum heart rate you need to maintain in a given amount of time to reach the energy level necessary to give your heart a good workout. To find your target heart rate to maximize your cardiovascular exercise, the first step is determining your maximum heart rate.</p>



<p>Your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age. Your target heart rate for moderate to vigorous exercise is about 50%–85% of your maximum heart rate.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Averages by age as a general guide are:</h3>



<ul>
<li>20: 100–170 beats per minute</li>



<li>30: 95–162 beats per minute</li>



<li>35: 93–157 beats per minute</li>



<li>40: 90–153 beats per minute</li>



<li>45: 88–149 beats per minute</li>



<li>50: 85–145 beats per minute</li>



<li>55: 83–140 beats per minute</li>



<li>60: 80–136 beats per minute</li>



<li>65: 78–132 beats per minute</li>



<li>70: 75–128 beats per minute</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What you can do</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Start slow.</strong>&nbsp;If you are beginning an exercise program, aim for the lower end of your target heart rate zone and then gradually build up intensity.</li>



<li><strong>Try interval training.</strong> <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/interval-training-for-heart-health/">Interval training</a>, which includes short bursts ― 15–60 seconds ― of higher-intensity exercise, alternated with longer, less strenuous exercise, effectively increases cardiovascular fitness. Talk with your healthcare team before trying interval training, but it is typically safe for those with existing heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.</li>



<li><strong>Take the "talk test."</strong>&nbsp;If you can carry on a conversation in brief sentences while exercising, you're probably in the moderate intensity range. You'll be breathing faster, developing a light sweat and feeling some muscle strain. If you're working at a vigorous intensity, you won't be able to say more than a few words without catching your breath. If you can sing while working out, you're probably in the low-intensity range, so step it up.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know your numbers</h2>



<p>Many wearable activity trackers can&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/how-to-take-pulse/art-20482581" target="_blank">monitor your heart rate</a>&nbsp;when you exercise and periodically throughout the day. If you don't have an activity tracker, you can use the radial artery in your wrist or the carotid artery in your neck. If you have heart disease or long-standing diabetes, it's best to use the artery on your wrist.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To find your heart rate manually:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Locate the artery you will use to find your heart rate.</li>



<li>Using the tips of your first two fingers, press lightly over the artery.</li>



<li>Count your heartbeats for 30 seconds and multiply by two to find your total beats per minute.</li>
</ul>



<p>If your heart rate is too high, take it easier. If it's too low, add some intensity and push yourself to get your heart rate closer to your target.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Abnormal heart rate</h3>



<p>If you experience irregular heartbeats, including a racing heartbeat, slow heartbeat or a feeling of fluttering in your chest, you may be experiencing a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/racing-heart-beat-heart-arrhythmia-101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart arrhythmia</a>. Heart rhythm or heartbeat problems can occur when the electrical impulses that coordinate your heartbeats don't work properly, causing your heart to beat too fast, slow or irregularly. Talk with your healthcare team if you have heart rhythm concerns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps</h2>

<p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken, making it harder to pump blood and sometimes causing an irregular heart rhythm.</p>



<p>"So right now, what we think in the United States, we've only diagnosed 1/7 of the people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So we're trying to increase the awareness in the community about this disease," says Dr. Alsidawi.</p>



<p>He says patients are born with a genetic mutation. The disease can start at a young age or later in life — many times with no symptoms.&nbsp; </p>



<p>"We know the patients that we lose to this condition, the majority of them are young, active and athletes. So high-level athletic exercise can put you at higher risk of sudden cardiac death," says Dr. Alsidawi.</p>



<p>He says it's important to seek medical attention if you have any symptoms, especially with exertion, "including shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheaded, dizzy or passing out."</p>



<p>If diagnosed, the good news is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be treated with medications, surgery, implanting a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/about/pac-20384692?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defibrillator</a> that monitors the heart or, in severe cases, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart transplantation</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Justin Pomeroy, 23, struggled after a weight training session, he wasn’t sure if he was simply fatigued or experiencing a medical crisis. While lifting weights, one of his shoulders popped, followed by radiating pain.</p>



<p>Despite being fit for his active job as a Florida-based U.S. Coast Guard crewman, he continued to feel debilitating weakness, even when making the slightest of movements.</p>



<p>His condition worsened over the next few days to the point that he went to the emergency department, where he learned he had numerous blood clots. Justin later came to learn that his struggle after weight training was an early warning sign of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353988">thoracic outlet syndrome</a>, also known as TOS.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seeking answers</strong></h2>



<p>Justin saw a physician who ran tests that indicated a blood clotting disorder. It was quickly identified that he had a predisposition to clotting due to a genetic blood mutation.</p>



<p>"At the time, I wasn't aware of how serious the situation was," Justin says. "Honestly, the whole time while in the hospital, I was more concerned about what work I was missing."</p>



<p>The discovery of blood clots, which were treated with anticoagulant medication, was just the beginning of Justin's ordeal. The Coast Guardsman who had been in excellent health would spend the next 18 months trying to discover why he had grown so weak that he couldn’t perform his job without stopping to rest.</p>



<p>"My arm had swollen to such a size that it had become unmanageable," Justin says. "I was in aviation, and it created a situation where I was grounded and not flying anymore."</p>



<p>More testing and bloodwork revealed that, in addition to the clotting disorder, Justin had TOS, a rare disorder that involves compression of the nerves, arteries or veins in the lower neck and upper chest.</p>



<p>"I was medically retired from the Coast Guard," Justin says. "It was devastating because that was my career path, and it was something I really wanted to do."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A 'nagging feeling'</strong></h2>



<p>Although disappointed to leave a job he loved, Justin didn’t stop looking for answers.</p>



<p>"I'm the type of person who likes to leave no stone left unturned, and I had this nagging feeling that more could be done to improve my situation," he says.</p>



<p>His search for answers led him to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, wanting to see a team familiar with TOS diagnoses. Diagnosing thoracic outlet syndrome is complex because symptoms vary greatly and often can be indicators of other health problems — making it a difficult condition to pin down. Because there are multiple types of TOS, forming the correct diagnosis is key to successful treatment.</p>



<p>Justin got in to see Justin Yarbrough, nurse practitioner, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/farres-sam-m-d/bio-20055440">Dr. Sam Farres,</a> chief of the Vascular Surgery Division. Justin says as he told them his story, the care team listened closely, asking questions and sharing information. "There was just a wealth of knowledge," says Justin. "I thought, they're going to help me find some answers."</p>



<p>The Mayo team ran tests and imaging studies that other facilities didn't do, Justin says, revealing he actually had two types of thoracic outlet syndrome — neurogenic and vascular. After trying conservative treatment approaches with mixed success, Justin and his care team made the decision together to schedule him for a rib resection surgery in September 2023.</p>



<p>"They didn't want to rush in and push me to have surgery," he says. "They really wanted to make sure we were doing the right thing for my specific situation."</p>



<p>He was amazed to find that shortly after surgery, he could be active again. But it wasn't just the outcome of his surgery that impressed him. Justin was overwhelmed by the care team's proficiency and level of attention throughout his journey.</p>



<p>"It was mind-blowing to show up to a medical appointment and they are already in the room waiting for you," he says. "They tried to get a very nuanced understanding of my condition, and if I asked a question, it was answered."</p>



<p>Today, Justin says he's pain-free and has greater mobility, allowing him to get back to activities he loves, like fishing on the open water.</p>



<p>"That's great news for me," he says, "but not-so-great news for the fish."</p>

<p>MANKATO, Minn. — With those New Year's resolutions six weeks behind us, some people may have reverted to less healthy ways of eating. Heart Month is a great time to remind yourself why a healthy diet is important for more than just your waistline.</p>



<p>"What you eat and drink affects your cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and if you have high cholesterol or triglyceride levels, your healthcare team may recommend following a cholesterol-lowering diet," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/ripu-singh-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripu Singh, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/cardiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> at Mayo Clinic Health System in <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mankato</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/waseca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waseca</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High cholesterol</a>&nbsp;could cause your heart arteries to harden, a condition called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atherosclerosis</a>, which&nbsp;could lead to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>. In addition, hardened arteries may allow a coating called plaque to build up and partially block your arteries. Blocked arteries can lead to low blood flow in the heart and chest pain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are triglycerides and cholesterol?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Triglycerides and cholesterol are types of lipids, or fats, which circulate in your blood. Triglycerides store unused calories and provide your body with energy. Cholesterol is used to build cells and certain hormones.</p>



<p>Cholesterol is made mainly by the liver but can also can enter your body in the foods you eat that contain animal fat. Foods that come from animals or contain animal fat include meat, egg yolks, lard and dairy products. The type and amount of fat you eat can influence how much cholesterol your body makes.</p>



<p>Your body makes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/triglycerides/art-20048186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triglycerides</a>&nbsp;from excess calories, regardless of the calorie source, such as fat, protein or carbohydrates. Triglycerides also are made from excess sugar and alcohol. High triglyceride levels are a risk factor for heart disease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lifestyle choices for improving your levels</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Your healthcare team may recommend some of these lifestyle changes to improve your blood cholesterol levels and lower your triglyceride level:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Eat a plant-based diet.</strong><br>Eat more high-fiber foods from plants. Choose 100% whole grains, whole fruits and vegetables.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Get to and stay at a healthy body weight.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Limit or avoid trans fats.</strong><br>Trans fats can raise blood cholesterol.</li>



<li><strong>Limit your intake of high-cholesterol foods.</strong><br>Reduce consumption of foods like egg yolks, organ meats, animal fat and high-fat dairy.</li>



<li><strong>Lower your total fat intake.</strong><br>All oils and fats are high in calories.</li>



<li><strong>Lower your saturated fat intake.</strong><br>Saturated fat can raise blood cholesterol.</li>



<li><strong>Replace saturated fats with unsaturated fats.</strong><br>Unsaturated fats can lower your blood cholesterol levels. Monounsaturated fats are preferred. Polyunsaturated fats are OK.</li>
</ul>



<p>"You can still enjoy foods you love, but you should prioritize a heart-healthy diet and eat less-healthy foods in moderation. Small changes can make a big impact in reducing your risk of heart disease," says Dr. Singh.</p>

<p>Triglycerides, the main kind of fat in your body, store extra energy from the food you eat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Triglycerides, the main kind of fat in your body, store extra energy from the food you eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's an energy source. It's like a little battery used for energy. But too many triglycerides can also cause heart disease," says Dr. Fernandes.</p>



<p>People who are overweight, in general, have high triglyceride levels and good cholesterol levels that are low.</p>



<p>"They may get heart disease not because their LDL is high, they get heart disease because the HDL is low and the triglycerides is high," he says.</p>



<p>And this is significant for people in their 30s and 40s.</p>



<p>So what can you do?&nbsp;Reducing simple carbohydrates, such as refined sugars and flours, can help lower your weight and improve your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. And you can back that up with exercise.</p>



<p>"One of the best ways to lower triglyceride levels is to exercise. Also, exercise helps to lose weight. And when you lose weight, your triglycerides improve a lot," says Dr. Fernandes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Harley’s fight to survive</strong></h2>



<p>Being together as a family has a deeper meaning for the Duffer family this Valentine’s day. In 2021, Harley suffered <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/clinical-trial-finds-cell-therapy-improves-quality-of-life-in-advanced-heart-failure/">heart failure</a> stemming from a rare genetic condition. He says doctors told him his only chance for survival was to get a heart transplant. </p>



<p>“I was basically on my deathbed,” says Harley. “They told me I had six months to live.” Doctors also told Harley the transplant would be the hardest thing he’s ever done in his whole life. </p>



<p>Harley says he had to fight to survive for his family.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The wait for a heart donor</strong></h2>



<p>Harley was placed in a medically induced coma at Mayo Clinic to minimize damage to his heart while waiting for a donor organ to become available. Each passing day took its toll on the family.</p>



<p>"There were several instances where the fear of him not making it through set in very heavy. And then you have a daughter at home saying ‘Where’s daddy? Where’s daddy?’ It was a lot to go through,” remembers Justine.</p>



<p>The Duffers got the call they were hoping for - a donor heart was available. Harley underwent a successful transplant and began his long road to recovery. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Heartfelt gratitude</strong></h2>



<p>After regaining his health, Harley got the chance to do something he never expected. He was given the opportunity to meet the family of his organ donor, Peyton Nurse.</p>



<p>Both families got together and listened to Peyton’s heart beating healthy and strong in Harley’s chest. </p>



<p>“I could not have asked for a better donor family. They are so caring and welcoming,” says Harley. “I understand they are going through a loss, but I want to be here for them. They are just the best kinds of people.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Remembering the life and legacy of Peyton Nurse </strong></h2>



<p>Peyton is remembered as a loving son, a brother, a friend to all, and a star student who always sought to help others in his community. He tragically lost his life in a car accident. His last wish was to be an organ donor. Peyton’s heart became the gift of life for Harley. </p>



<p>“We went to see Peyton’s resting place,” says Harley. “Such bravery and selflessness from a young man. I just want to say thank you to Peyton’s family, for your son’s bravery and the sacrifices he’s made.”</p>

<p>Harley and Justine are now back at home with their daughter, Libi, and their newborn baby girl. With their hearts full of love and gratitude, and the hope to carry on the legacy of their heart donor, they named their new baby girl, Peyton. </p>



<p>“We want her to know the importance of organ donation, and that’s why her daddy is still here, to raise his girls, and be here with us all together,” says Justine. </p>

<p>Carrying on the legacy of her son’s name means the world to his mom Lesley. “I can’t wait to hold baby Peyton in person and hold her in my arms,” shares Lesley. The name “Peyton” holds a special place in her heart because not only was it her son’s name, but a name that was handed down for several generations in her family.  </p>



<p>Lesley shared these two pictures as a Valentine’s Day message to serve as a reminder of the power of love, legacy and the gift of life. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Several countries observe Heart Month in February</em></h2>



<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Switching from an unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle to healthy eating and exercise can be daunting. In this expert alert, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cardenas-rosales-juan-c-m-d/bio-20526630?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Juan Cardenas Rosales, M.D.</a>, an internal medicine physician and medical director of the international medicine practice at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Jacksonville, Florida, shares small steps and one big one that can lead to a heart-healthy life.</p>



<p>Taking the first step can be difficult, whether trying to eat a nutritious diet, exercise more or both, Dr. Cardenas says. That is in part because people often set high expectations for themselves and try to reach them immediately, rather than approaching it as a process.</p>



<p>"It is better to make these changes little by little, and stay consistent, than to make a sudden change that is difficult to maintain," Dr. Cardenas explains. "For example, don't start exercising 30 minutes a day, five times a week, but start with 10 minutes every third day. Also, adjust your diet, and each day lower your sugar consumption a little, your fat consumption, your salt, and so on, little by little. Start with small steps but keep moving forward."</p>



<p>Dr. Cardenas recommends gradually substituting healthier choices into your diet, such as fish, chicken, fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains.</p>



<p>"Drinking a lot of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water</a> is also important, at least 2 liters of water a day, and staying away from processed foods that are very high in certain types of harmful fats like trans fats," Dr. Cardenas says.</p>



<p>One of the hardest moves to make can be skipping favorite foods that are now known to be unhealthy but have been part of family meals for generations, he adds.</p>



<p>"Many times, in our culture, our tradition, this type of diet has been followed for many years, and it is what we were often taught by our relatives, our grandmother, our parents. But many times, that does not mean that it is healthy for us," Dr. Cardenas says. "If we know that it is something that is harmful to our health, we should always try to choose the healthy option."</p>



<p>Working toward adequate sleep — at least seven hours — is also important for heart health. It reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and serious conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol, that are also risk factors for heart disease, Dr. Cardenas says.</p>



<p>"By having a good sleep, we also allow our body to recover and to be ready to continue the next day," he explains. "It has also been shown that many times, not sleeping well can lead to chronic stress."</p>



<p>There is one big change that Dr. Cardenas recommends making immediately: Stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke, exposure to other people's smoke.</p>



<p>"The moment one stops smoking, the risk of cardiovascular disease decreases," he says. "Research has shown that after one year of completing quitting smoking, the cardiovascular risk falls to half that of a person who smokes."</p>



<p>Before starting an exercise plan, it is a good idea to talk with your healthcare team to ensure a safe approach, Dr. Cardenas advises. It is also a good practice to schedule annual checkups so your healthcare team can screen for heart disease and risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol, he adds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>What may appear as normal symptoms during pregnancy may overlap with red flags for heart failure.</p>



<p>"(Symptoms can include) lower extremity swelling, shortness of breath with walking short distances or shortness of breath when laying in the bed flat on your back at night," says Dr. Adedinsewo.</p>



<p>Delays in diagnosis can be deadly. And some who are pregnant have an even greater risk of developing heart failure.</p>



<p>"There is a unique form of heart failure that occurs during pregnancy and shortly after having a baby called peripartum <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiomyopathy</a>," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "Black women have up to a sixteenfold risk of developing this condition, compared to white women."</p>



<p>Eating a healthy diet, exercising, getting enough sleep and not smoking can lower risks. Dr. Adedinsewo recommends attending regular appointments with your healthcare team and checking blood glucose and blood lipids.</p>



<p>"If we are able to test and evaluate a tool that can use something as simple as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983?_ga=2.204175184.1519000234.1596213841-659235982.1596213841?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EKG</a> to identify a woman who's pregnant and at high risk of having heart failure, we can initiate appropriate therapies and reduce the risk of dying during this time period," she says.</p>

<p>When you think about exercise, sweating through a cycling class, adding up miles from a brisk walk or pumping iron in the weight room may come to mind. But there's a different form of exercise that uses something besides movement to give you a workout. It's&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/isometric-exercises/faq-20058186" target="_blank">isometric exercise</a>, which is gaining attention for its role in helping lower and control your blood pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is isometric exercise?</h2>



<p>Isometric exercise focuses on tightening or contracting a specific muscle or group of muscles. The targeted muscles don't noticeably change in length, and the joints involved don't move. The exercise is done in a static position and relies on your body's weight to help maintain strength and stabilize your joints and core.</p>



<p>Because isometric exercise doesn't involve movement or full range of motion and targets specific muscles, it can improve strength and stability for people recovering from an injury or those with arthritis.</p>



<p>One misconception about isometric exercise is that it involves straining and holding your breath, which can raise your blood pressure. To hold an isometric or static exercise, you need to concentrate on slowly breathing in and out.</p>



<p>New research has revealed that isometric exercise can be an effective tool for preventing or lowering high blood pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is blood pressure important?</h2>



<p>High blood pressure is harmful because it makes the heart work harder and less efficiently. For a quick review of&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/about.htm" target="_blank">blood pressure</a>, there are two key numbers when&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/measure.htm" target="_blank">measuring your blood pressure</a>: systolic and diastolic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define these as:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Systolic blood pressure</strong><br>Measures the maximum pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts and relaxes.</li>



<li><strong>Diastolic blood pressure</strong><br>Measures the arterial pressure when the heart rests between beats.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/know-your-heart-health-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Healthy blood pressure</a> is less than 120/80 mm Hg.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the new research findings about exercise and blood pressure?</h2>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/20/1317" target="_blank">large study</a>&nbsp;published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers examined the recommendations for exercise to help lower blood pressure, which relied on older research that stressed aerobic or cardio exercises like cycling or running. The study also looked at the effects on blood pressure from high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, and isometric exercise.</p>



<p>The authors defined healthy resting blood pressure as below 130/85 mm Hg and high blood pressure as 140/90 mm Hg.</p>



<p>The study authors reviewed 270 trials with 15,827 participants between 1990 and 2023, and compared the results for isometric, HIIT, aerobic exercise, dynamic resistance training and a combination of the last two forms of exercise. Their findings were that isometric exercise led to the most significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can you build isometric exercise into your workout?</h2>



<p>Isometric exercise is an excellent addition to your <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/cardiology/prevention-and-self-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular and strength training routines</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Wall sits and planks are two of the best isometric exercises for lowering blood pressure. Here's how to do them:</h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wall sit</strong></h4>



<p>Stand with your back toward a wall. Step out about 2 feet from the wall. Place your feet firmly on the ground and shoulder-width apart. Slide your back down the wall while keeping your abdominal muscles tight and bending your legs until they're at 90 degrees or a right angle. It's like sitting in a chair without the chair. Check that your knees are straight above your ankles.</p>



<p>This exercise focuses on your glutes, or buttock, muscles and quadriceps, or thigh, muscles, as well as your abdominal or core muscles.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Planks</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wall plank</strong><br>Stand facing a wall. Place your elbows and forearms on the wall. Take a step back, tuck in your bottom, and tighten your abdominal muscles by pulling your belly button into your spine. Hold for 20 seconds.</li>



<li><strong>Floor plank on knees</strong><br>Lie on your stomach and prop yourself up slightly on your forearms. Using your knees and forearms, lift your hips off the floor to about the same height as your shoulders. Hold this position, focusing on using your core muscles, for 20 seconds. To progress to a harder version, press your toes into the floor, then lift your knees off the floor and squeeze your glutes and core to create a plank that involves full-body tension. Think about pulling your belly button into your spine.</li>
</ul>



<p>Planks focus on your back, shoulders and abdominal muscles.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">With both exercises:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Remember to breathe slowly and regularly to give your muscles the oxygen they need.</li>
