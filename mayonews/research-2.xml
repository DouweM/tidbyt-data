<p>With age, cells can experience senescence, a state where they stop growing but continue releasing inflammatory and tissue-degrading molecules. When a person is young, the immune system responds and eliminates senescent cells, often referred to as zombie cells. However, zombie cells linger and contribute to various age-related health problems and diseases. Mayo Clinic researchers, in two studies, shed light on the biology of aging cells.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.14006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Aging Cell, Mayo Clinic researchers analyzed zombie cells to explain aging at the cellular level.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Jennifer-St-Sauver-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378428" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Jennifer-St-Sauver-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Jennifer-St-Sauver.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jennifer St. Sauver, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We know people age at different rates and that a person's chronological age doesn't always match their biological age," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/st-sauver-jennifer-ph-d/bio-00027743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer St. Sauver, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;the lead author of the study and scientific director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/education-training/population-health-scholars-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Population Health Science Scholars Program</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a>. "We found that a group of diverse proteins secreted by zombie cells can serve as biomarkers of senescence and can predict health outcomes in older adults. We also found that measuring these biomarkers in the blood can help predict mortality beyond the combination of a person's chronologic age, sex or presence of a chronic disease."</p>



<p>The study included 1,923 adults aged 65 and older with one health condition or none. The group included 1,066 women and 857 men, with 68% of study participants having no chronic conditions and 32% having one condition.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Nathan-LeBrasseur-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378427" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Nathan-LeBrasseur-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Nathan-LeBrasseur.jpg 533w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nathan LeBrasseur, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"What's so unique about this study is that even in the absence of disease, biomarkers are highly predictive of bad health outcomes in the future," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lebrasseur-nathan-k-ph-d-m-s/bio-00055041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nathan LeBrasseur, Ph.D.</a>, director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-arlene-kogod-center-aging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging</a>&nbsp;and senior author of the study. Dr. LeBrasseur studies the biological processes that drive aging.</p>



<p>The researchers noted that the most common chronic conditions in the group were arthritis, high cholesterol and a history of cancer.</p>



<p>Researchers found that higher levels of specific senescent biomarkers, such as GDF15, VEGFA, PARC and MMP2, were all associated with an increased risk of death. Some of these biomarkers have been associated with developing chronic diseases. For example, research has shown that people with heart disease and some types of cancers have higher levels of GDF15 and VEGFA. Ongoing studies are investigating how lifestyle factors, including diet, physical activity and medications that appear to help clear senescent cells, influence the circulating levels of the biomarkers.</p>



<p>Dr. LeBrasseur envisions using these biomarkers as tools for clinical practice to find people at risk for health challenges. In addition, research could benefit from identifying subjects who may be most responsive to emerging ways to target senescent cells and gauge their responsiveness to treatment.</p>



<p>Dr. St. Sauver underscores the need to include more diversity in future studies, ensuring various populations are included in ongoing aging research.</p>



<p>"We did see differences in levels of these biomarkers between men and women, and we also know that race and ethnicity influence many biological processes," says Dr. St. Sauver. "For future studies, we must consider these factors in aging research."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Uncovering unknown phenomenon in zombie cells</strong></h2>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Joao-Passos-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378429" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Joao-Passos-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Joao-Passos-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Joao-Passos.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joao Passos, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Mayo Clinic researcher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/passos-joao-ph-d/bio-20454365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joao Passos, Ph.D.</a>, who also studies the biology of aging, sees his main purpose as working to enhance the vitality and health span—the period of life free from the consequences of disease and disability—in older people.</p>



<p>In a new study published in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37821702/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a>, he, along with postdoctoral researcher Stella Victorelli, Ph.D., and a large interdisciplinary team of collaborators, uncovered a previously unknown phenomenon that occurs in zombie cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mitochondria, the tiny powerhouses within a cell, are responsible for producing energy but also play a crucial role when a cell incurs excessive damage. They can initiate a self-destruct mechanism called apoptosis, which leads to a cell's death. Senescent cells, which do not die, are notorious for resisting apoptosis. These two processes, apoptosis and senescence, have often been regarded as opposite cell fates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Dr. Passos, Dr. Victorelli and the team unexpectedly observed a small group of "rogue" mitochondria attempt to initiate apoptosis in senescent cells. When they do so, these mitochondria release their DNA into the cell's cytosol, the "soup" inside a cell. Mitochondria were once independent bacteria, so the cell perceives the mitochondrial DNA as foreign, which sparks inflammation that can damage tissues and lead to disease.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the researchers found that if they blocked this process in mice equivalent in age to a 70-year-old human, they could reduce tissue inflammation and significantly boost their health, including improving their strength, balance and bone structure.  </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Stella-Victorelli-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-378426" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Stella-Victorelli-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Stella-Victorelli-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Stella-Victorelli.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Stella Victorelli, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This newfound knowledge of the inner workings of a senescent cell may open doors to new types of therapeutics, beyond senolytics that eliminate senescent cells, to improve peoples' health span.</p>



<p>"Inflammation is one of the main ways we think senescent cells cause detrimental effects in aging-related diseases. So, it's exciting to have found a way to target a pathway that reduces inflammation," Dr. Victorelli explains.  </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mapping out the big picture </strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Passos and colleagues, in collaboration with researchers across the U.S., are part of an ambitious project to map senescent cells across different tissues. The project is called the Cellular Senescence Network (<a href="https://sennetconsortium.org/involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenNet</a>) and is funded by the National Institutes of Health Common Fund. Its primary objective is to compile a comprehensive atlas of senescent cells within the human body over a lifetime. Dr. Passos recently spearheaded an effort published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00446-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Aging</a>&nbsp;to highlight emerging technologies and challenges in&nbsp;<a href="https://discoverysedge.mayo.edu/2021/11/10/a-zombie-cell-expedition-and-other-senescent-cell-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spatial mapping of cellular senescence</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"By targeting these fundamental mechanisms driving the aging process rather than tackling each disease individually, we have the potential to not only fight one disease of aging but all of them," Dr. Passos says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart failure is a potentially urgent health concern for young <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-congenital-heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355456?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adults with congenital heart disease</a> (ACHD) that is often overlooked and undertreated, even as hospitalizations for this condition continue to rise. New research from Mayo Clinic shows that young adults in the U.S. living with congenital heart disease are at an increased risk of death or cardiovascular complications after being hospitalized for heart failure. However, study data published in the <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Heart Association</a> also found that patients who had been receiving recent cardiology care before a heart failure hospitalization were less likely to die.</p>



<p>"More than 85% of children born with congenital heart disease reach adulthood. They are likely to experience complications later, yet 61% of these patients beyond the age of 18 do not see a cardiology specialist," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/medical-innovation/burchill-congenital-heart-disease?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke Burchill, M.B.B.S., Ph.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study.

<p><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.118.008775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prior research</a> showed that heart failure hospitalizations of U.S. adults with congenital heart disease increased dramatically from 1998 to 2011. To further understand this trend and its effect on patients and hospital resources, Dr. Burchill and colleagues used national data to study a retrospective cohort of adults with congenital heart disease hospitalized in the past decade. The percentage of ACHD heart failure hospitalizations increased significantly, rising from 6.6% in 2010 to 14% in 2020.</p>



<p>In more than 26,000 unique hospital admissions of ACHD patients, 22% had heart failure and 78% did not. Those admitted with heart failure had a higher risk of death and other major heart and brain complications and used more healthcare resources, including rehospitalization and post-acute care services than those admitted without heart failure. However, people who had a cardiology clinic visit within 30 days prior to hospital admission had lower rates of death due to any causes at the 90-day and 1-year mark.</p>



<p>The ACHD patients with heart failure were nearly twice as likely as those without heart failure to be readmitted to a hospital, especially those under age 45, regardless of their type of congenital heart disease. Younger patients also required more medical or supportive care after they left the hospital before they could return home and care for themselves.</p>



<p>"Many of the patients I meet with ACHD and heart failure share a similar story of not having their heart-related symptoms taken seriously, leading to a delayed recognition and treatment of heart failure. The good news is that we can reset the course for most," says Dr. Burchill. "We have new medications to restrengthen the heart, new options for replacing heart valves without opening the chest, and low-risk treatments for returning heart rhythm to normal. Our goal is to shift the focus from heart failure to heart function and patient success in feeling better and living longer."</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers studying the genetics of people who had recently developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dilated-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20353149">dila</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dilated-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20353149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dilated-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20353149">ed cardiomyopathy</a>, one of the most common causes of heart failure, have found a particular gene to target for developing future drug therapy treatments. The disease makes it harder for the heart's left ventricle to pump blood effectively to the rest of the body. In this first genome-wide association&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37800334/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, the researchers sought to understand why some patients get better after developing the condition — and some don't.</p>



<p>"We found genetic variation in the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene, a gene that no one has heard of in cardiology, and its link to improvement in heart function in these patients," says lead author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/pereira-naveen-l-m-d/bio-20055103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, who studies genetic variation and its implications in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease, specifically heart failure.</p>



<p>Genetic variation in the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene can lead to differences in the protein's structure, potentially influencing a person's susceptibility to various diseases or their response to specific therapies.</p>



<p>The researchers identified and examined the role of the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene because of this gene's link to improving the heart's left ventricle to pump blood effectively in people with dilated cardiomyopathy. The&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene is often variably expressed in fibroblasts (connective tissue) of people with this condition. In addition, fibrosis (excess fibrous connective tissue in the heart) plays an essential role in the prognosis of this disease.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Naveen-Pereira-200x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-378322" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Naveen-Pereira-200x300.png 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Naveen-Pereira.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Pereira notes interestingly that they also found that genetic variation in or near&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;was significantly associated with death due to heart failure.</p>



<p>They also noted that decreasing this gene’s expression in cardiac connective tissue significantly decreased cardiac fibroblast proliferation and downregulated the&nbsp;<em>IL1RL1</em>&nbsp;gene. This gene encodes one of the most important heart failure biomarkers, sST2. High levels of this biomarker are associated with fibrosis and death; a decrease in&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;decreases the expression of this protein. Understanding the regulation of sST2 and its relationship with&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;and fibrosis is essential for developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of heart failure.</p>



<p>Dr. Pereira explains that these findings raise the possibility of targeting the&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;gene to decrease cardiac fibrosis, which may improve heart function. The study, therefore, has implications for developing new drug therapies for dilated cardiomyopathy and potentially other conditions affected by fibrosis.</p>



<p>According to a report from the American Heart Association, heart failure is an increasingly common diagnosis in the U.S., with a projection of affecting over 8 million people by 2030, an increase of 46% from the present day.</p>



<p>Between 30% and 40% of heart failure cases are due to dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>



<p>"It is the most common cause of a person needing a heart transplant," says Dr. Pereira. “A key indicator of whether patients with dilated cardiomyopathy will recover is whether they have cardiac fibrosis.”</p>



<p>Based on these preliminary findings, the Mayo researchers are doing further animal studies to understand the effect of&nbsp;<em>CDCP1</em>&nbsp;on heart failure. They are developing molecules to assess their therapeutic potential for dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.</p>



<p>"By continuing with this research that started with a human population that we took to the molecular and now animal laboratory, we hope to find new avenues for treatments to take back to the human population we studied, to improve patients' survival and quality of life ultimately," says Dr. Pereira.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Funding</strong></h2>



<p>The Mayo Clinic Department of Cardiovascular Medicine and Center for Individualized Medicine funded the study. Review the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37800334/">study</a> for a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding. </p>

<p>During breaks from his doctoral research in London, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vile-richard-g-ph-d/bio-00027663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</a>, would visit a pediatric brain tumor clinic next to his lab for inspiration. Seeing children suffer changed the course of his career, igniting his passion for finding <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> treatments that would be easier for people to tolerate.</p>



<p>"I became very, very motivated to try and apply the science I learned to make cancer treatments gentler," says Dr. Vile. "My goal was to deliver an option that would extend and improve quality of life."</p>



<p>Decades later, Dr. Vile is leading research into genetically engineered viruses aimed at unleashing a two-pronged attack on cancer. One part of this technology, known as an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/oncolytic-virus-optimizes-car-t-cell-therapy-for-solid-tumors/mac-20537878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oncolytic virus</a>, is designed to infect, break open and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue. Dr. Vile's <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn2231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preclinical studies</a> have shown that oncolytic viruses replicated in cancer cells and cascaded to kill other diseased cells. That, in turn, triggered an immune response in which the patient’s own T cells, stimulated by the virus, recognized and targeted metastasized tumors for a second wave of cancer destruction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005.jpg" alt="Richard Vile, Ph.D." class="wp-image-377676" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005.jpg 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Vile_1620845_3874783_0005-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Richard Vile, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"Oncolytic viruses are a way to alert the immune system and mobilize it to kill cells infected with cancer," says Dr. Vile. "There's the direct killing of cancer cells with the virus, and then there's the major effect of immune activation. The immune system is incredibly well evolved to recognize infection, clear infection and kill all the cells around it that could be harboring infection."</p>



<p>In groundbreaking research, Dr. Vile's team is combining oncolytic viruses with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy</a>) to target solid tumors from liver cancer. This experimental approach of loading CAR-T cells with oncolytic virus is a new way to expand CAR-T cell therapy beyond treatment for blood cancers into treatment for solid tumors.</p>



<p>CAR-T cell therapy is a regenerative immunotherapy in which a patient's T-cells are genetically modified to recognize and stop cancer. It has shown great promise by putting some B-cell lymphomas and leukemias into remission. CAR-T cells are highly targeted to tumor cells, with the goal of having fewer side effects than cancer treatments that also kill nearby healthy tissue.</p>



<p>"Loading the oncolytic virus onto CAR-T cells may give us three levels of killing. First, the CAR-T cells target the tumor and kill some of the cells," says Dr. Vile. "Next, it delivers the oncolytic virus, which infects tumor cells, replicates and kills them. Third, that alerts the immune system of the patient to the fact that there's something majorly wrong. The immune system starts to see the cancer and starts to react against it and kill it."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;supports Dr. Vile's research as part of its objective of delivering new cell therapies to people with complex disorders such as cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing the challenges</strong></h2>



<p>Oncolytic viruses are advancing from the lab to first-in-human clinical trials. Dr. Vile is working with the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics to biomanufacture oncolytic viruses onsite in Mayo Clinic's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) facilities. CGMP facilities are sterile rooms that help ensure that the therapy meets the identity, strength, quality and purity standards that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires for testing new therapeutics.</p>



<p>On-site biomanufacturing could lower production costs, allow for more individualized treatment and deliver the treatment to patients sooner than might be possible with an outside manufacturer.</p>



<p>"We are completing our studies in the lab and are transitioning to safety studies in the patient," explained Dr. Vile. "At the same time, we will manufacture the virus at a level of cleanliness (sterility) to meet FDA standards."</p>



<p>Oncolytic virus therapy is evolving, with more research needed to validate its safety and effectiveness. Dr. Vile hopes to test oncolytic viruses with CAR-T cell therapy for liver cancer in a phase 1 clinical trial in the next year or two.</p>

<p>A recent Mayo Clinic retrospective&nbsp;<a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.23.00118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;shows that cancer practices can integrate telehealth without duplicative care, allowing for a more streamlined healthcare experience for patients and their caregivers.</p>



<p>Researchers analyzed trends in telehealth use from 2019 to 2021 across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/3-sites-1-comprehensive-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. The study looked at hematology and oncology visits conducted across Mayo Clinic campuses in Minnesota, Florida and Arizona, as well as at community-based clinics across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a>.</p>



<p>In 2019, telehealth visits accounted for fewer than 0.01% of all visits. In 2020, a significant rise in telehealth use occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the portion of visits conducted via telehealth increasing to 11%. By 2021, that figure rose to 14%, demonstrating a continued turn toward telehealth beyond the immediate pandemic response.</p>

Pritchett, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We're showing that not only did our providers continue to use telehealth after the initial surge, but adoption (of the technology) increased over time and did not lead to increases in per-patient or per-provider care volumes," says lead author of the study, Joshua C. Pritchett, M.D., a hematology and oncology fellow at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Overall, researchers examined over 100,000 visits conducted from 2019 to 2021, representing one of the largest analyses of telehealth use trends among cancer patients to date. Among people receiving established, ongoing care during the study, it found that 39.4% took part in at least one telehealth visit, demonstrating the critical role telehealth has played in the care of patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Researchers note that the study demonstrates that patient satisfaction ratings for telehealth visits remained similar to satisfaction with in-person care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Beyond telehealth, the Mayo Clinic remote patient monitoring program is continuing to expand into the cancer space, allowing us to provide tablets and wearable devices for improved monitoring and in-between visit care," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/haddad-tufia-c-m-d/bio-20055534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tufia C. Haddad, M.D.,</a> a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist and the study's senior author. "This will continue to help us understand how our patients are doing, how their symptoms and vital signs are tracking so that we can intervene earlier when things are not trending in a favorable direction."</p>



<p>With the many challenges of needing to get to and from appointments, telehealth has proved to be a worthy resource for many patients and their caregivers. The study showed that 52% of all visits by people undergoing treatment for various forms of brain cancer were conducted by video or phone technologies, demonstrating how access to care from home can be invaluable for many.</p>



<p>"The home is where healthcare happens," says Dr. Haddad. "Increasingly, we are seeing a continued shift in care to the home environment where smart homes enabled by digital technologies help assess and monitor patients. In the future, I think that will be more commonplace, and from there, we will only see the continued growth of virtual care delivery."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reimbursement structures may affect the future of telehealth growth</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers noted that 20% of the U.S. population lives and works in rural areas; however, only 3% of oncology practices provide care there. For those in rural areas finding it difficult to travel for cancer care, telehealth has proven to be a lifeline when available.</p>



<p>The study showed a significantly higher rate of phone visits in rural populations versus video visits. Dr. Pritchett says the increased use of telehealth through phone visits is encouraging and shows a willingness by rural patients with cancer to engage with telehealth overall.</p>



<p>However, he notes that with the end of the Public Health Emergency Declaration applied in response to COVID-19, there has been a decline in reimbursement for phone visits compared to video visits. This change has the potential to create a widening disparity between urban, suburban and rural residents, and shows a need for future studies to examine how to increase video visit use among rural populations, he says.</p>



<p>"Telehealth in cancer care isn't simply a byproduct of the pandemic response. Patients desire this type of care, and it has become an integral part of patient-centered cancer care that continues to evolve," says Dr. Pritchett. "I think a big takeaway from this work is going to be how we make sure that it continues to be equitable and accessible to patients, as well as sustainable for practices."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic researchers demonstrated a nearly 20% increase in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a> vaccination rates among adolescents through a combination intervention approach, a new Mayo Clinic study finds. The strategy involved mailing reminders to parents about their child's eligibility for the HPV vaccine and simultaneously giving healthcare providers feedback about successful HPV vaccine administration among the patients they had recently seen.</p>



<p>The findings, published in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2812161">JAMA Pediatrics</a>, suggest healthcare practices could adopt this evidence-based approach to boost HPV vaccination uptake in 11- and 12-year-olds.</p>



<p>"HPV vaccine uptake at 60% of eligible adolescents falls short of national public health goals and lags other adolescent vaccines," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/jacobson-robert-m-m-d/bio-00083020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Jacobson, M.D.</a>, a pediatrician in the Mayo Clinic Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. Dr. Jacobson is a co-principal investigator of the study.</p>



<p>Human papillomaviruses cause viral infections transmitted sexually through skin-to-skin contact. HPV infections may occur without symptoms or signs in late adolescence or early adulthood and affect both males and females. The virus can cause several types of cancers, including of the cervix, anus, genital area, mouth and throat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cases.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimates</a> 37,000 HPV-linked cancers occur each year in the U.S., all of which may be prevented by the HPV vaccination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the study, the researchers evaluated their intervention strategy at six Mayo Clinic primary care practices in Southeastern Minnesota. The investigation involved 9,242 adolescents who were due to receive at least one dose of the HPV vaccine. When parents received reminders in the mail and providers were simultaneously given feedback, 39.7% of patients got their doses due in the months that followed the interventions, as contrasted to 21.9% without the interventions.</p>



<p>“Our study investigated both parent- and provider-facing interventions. By targeting parents and providers, we achieved much higher improvements in HPV vaccine uptake than the use of these strategies in isolation,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rutten-lila-j-ph-d/bio-20551780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lila Finney Rutten, Ph.D.</a>, lead author and chair of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/quantitative-health-sciences/divisions/epidemiology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Division of Epidemiology</a>.</p>



<p>The researchers say the study not only addresses the low HPV vaccination rate but also holds the potential to reshape other public health and vaccination campaigns.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers and collaborators have identified a protein expressed by immune cells that may play a key role in the development of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</a>, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The team also found that an immunomodulatory treatment that blocks the protein was able to restore motor function in preclinical models. The findings suggest that the protein, known as α5 integrin (pronounced alpha 5 integrin), is a potential therapeutic target for ALS.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2306731120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fatal disease</strong></h2>



<p>ALS is a fatal motor neuron disease. People with ALS often die within three years of diagnosis. While there have been advances in understanding ALS, there is no cure or treatment that significantly improves motor function or extends survival in those with the disease. Although loss of motor neurons is the hallmark of ALS, the immune system also is involved in most people.</p>



<p>The disease involves activation of immune cells, including microglial cells and macrophages, which have pro-inflammatory properties. Microglial cells are immune cells specific to the nervous system. Macrophages are general immune system "cleanup" cells that are present in the peripheral nervous system.</p>



<p>The research team found the protein α5 integrin, which is expressed by microglial cells and macrophages, is present in abundance in the motor system in people with ALS, including in those with a genetic cause of the disease.</p>

Roemer, M.D., Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Our study found α5 integrin to be expressed in immune cells and also in blood vessels in active stages of the disease, as well as in end-stage disease,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/neuropathology-microscopy/about/team-bios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shanu F. Roemer, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic neuropathologist and co-first author of the study. The team also found that α5 integrin is not expressed in brain tissue from people without ALS or other neurodegenerative or inflammatory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (a Parkinsonian disorder) or sepsis.</p>



<p>"The findings suggest α5 integrin plays a role in the pathology of ALS," says Dr. Roemer. "Because α5 integrin appears selective to ALS and is upregulated in brain and nerve fibers outside of the spinal cord in ALS, it opens up the possibility of exploring α5 integrin as a diagnostic and treatment biomarker."</p>



<p>In addition to preclinical models, the researchers examined human tissue from the Mayo Clinic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-neuroscience-florida/biorepositories/als-brain-bank-autopsy-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ALS Brain Bank and Autopsy Program</a>&nbsp;to determine the pervasiveness of α5 integrin in ALS.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/dickson-dennis-w-m-d/bio-00027499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dennis W. Dickson, M.D.</a>, the Robert E. Jacoby Professor of Alzheimer's Research and a neuroscientist in Mayo Clinic's Department of Neuroscience in Florida, directs the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-neuroscience-florida/biorepositories/mayo-clinic-brain-bank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain bank</a>&nbsp;and also is a co-author of the study.&nbsp;The brain bank works closely with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/oskarsson-bjorn-e-m-d/bio-20486118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bjorn Oskarsson, M.D.</a>, director of Mayo Clinic’s ALS clinic, and includes a large collection of brain and spinal cord tissue from people with ALS who donated their brains to Mayo Clinic for ALS research. The researchers used more than 100 ALS tissue samples in the study.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Possible novel pathway</strong></h2>



<p>The study team also explored a pathway for potential treatment. They found that a monoclonal antibody that blocks α5 integrin was able to preserve motor function in mice models. Monoclonal antibodies are synthesized immune system proteins used as a treatment for a wide range of diseases.</p>



<p>"Our findings showed that the antibody treatment against α5 integrin seemed to protect motor function, delay disease progression and increase survival," says Dr. Roemer. "Taken together, the findings regarding the upregulation of α5 integrin and its response to a monoclonal antibody suggest α5 integrin may be a potential therapeutic target for modulation of neuroinflammation in ALS."</p>



<p>Because several drugs exist that target other integrins for different diseases, the researchers suggest that a clinical trial to test α5 integrin as a drug target in ALS might be worthwhile.

<p>New research from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) could improve the diagnosis of peripartum <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">cardiomyopathy</a>, a potentially life-threatening and treatable condition that weakens the heart muscle of women during pregnancy or in the months after giving birth. Researchers used an AI-enabled digital stethoscope that captures <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983">electrocardiogram</a> (ECG) data and heart sounds to identify twice as many cases of peripartum cardiomyopathy as compared to regular care, <a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/ai-technology-improved-detection-of-heart-disease-during-and-after-pregnancy">according to a news</a> release from the American Heart Association.</p>



<p>Identifying a weak heart pump caused by pregnancy is important because the symptoms, such as shortness of breath when lying down, swelling of hands and feet, weight gain, and rapid heartbeat, can be confused with normal symptoms of pregnancy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20502753">Dr. Demilade Adedinsewo</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic, shared research insights during a late-breaking science presentation at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2023.</p>



<p>Women in Nigeria have the highest reported incidence of peripartum cardiomyopathy. The randomized pragmatic clinical trial enrolled 1,195 women receiving pregnancy care in Nigeria. Approximately half were evaluated with AI-guided screening using the digital stethoscope, and half received usual obstetric care in addition to a clinical ECG. An <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856">echocardiogram</a> was used to confirm when the AI-enabled digital stethoscope predicted peripartum cardiomyopathy. Overall, 4% of the pregnant and postpartum women in the intervention arm of the clinical trial had cardiomyopathy compared to 2% in the control arm, suggesting that half are likely undetected with usual care.</p>

<p>During clinical rotations in medical school, Kianna Nguyen encountered many patients with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-problems/symptoms-causes/syc-20374502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver failure</a>&nbsp;and was struck by a grim reality: Their only hope was a transplant. The shortage of donor organs and therapeutic options was at once frustrating and inspirational, triggering her research interest in cellular therapies for liver failure.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Nguyen-Kianna-M._21458961_201906170422.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376863" style="aspect-ratio:0.83375;width:197px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Nguyen-Kianna-M._21458961_201906170422.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Nguyen-Kianna-M._21458961_201906170422-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kianna Nguyen<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Research provides us with the understanding to develop tools to make big changes in clinical problems like those facing patients with liver failure," says Nguyen. "I want to be on the forefront of developing medical technologies that provide alternatives. I derive a lot of passion for research through thinking about the future patients I will be treating in the clinic."</p>



<p>Nguyen is a fifth-year M.D.-Ph.D. student in the&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine</a>, who is also completing her Ph.D. in regenerative sciences through the&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/">Mayo Clinic Graduate School o</a><a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">f</a><a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/">&nbsp;Biomedical Sciences</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Her research is focused on redirecting human embryonic stem cells to become liver cells with the potential for cell, tissue and organ repair. This research is aimed at providing an alternative to a liver transplant.</p>



<p>Supervising her research is mentor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/revzin-alexander-ph-d/bio-20359633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexander Revzin, Ph.D.</a>, who leads Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/cellular-microsystems-biosensors/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cellular Microsystems and Biosensors Laboratory</a>. Dr Revzin is a biomedical engineer and scientist whose lab has developed a technique to encapsulate stem cells and reprogram them to become different cell types with therapeutic potential. The stem cells reside in a microcapsule — &nbsp;a microscopic plastic container filled with an aqueous solution. The microcapsule protects the cells from physical damage during bioprocessing and may be used to deliver signals that direct stem cells toward a desired tissue such as pancreas or liver tissue. The goal of the project is to use microcapsules to make liver tissue in sufficient quantities for use in humans. The hope is to one day transplant these cells as a treatment for complex diseases such as liver failure.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Revzin-Alexander-PhD_20130571_201610040336.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376864" style="aspect-ratio:0.83375;width:251px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Revzin-Alexander-PhD_20130571_201610040336.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Revzin-Alexander-PhD_20130571_201610040336-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alexander Revzin, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Encapsulation is an exciting new way to allow for scalable manufacturing of cellular therapies while decreasing the cost," says Dr. Revzin. “Kianna Nguyen has a unique skill set to work on this project. She is trained as a chemical engineer and biomaterials scientist and is well-positioned to develop encapsulation strategies. She is passionate about improving outcomes for patients with end-stage liver disease."</p>



<p>"The additional advantage of growing liver cells inside of capsules is they are provided with a protective shell so that they are not destroyed by the immune system when they are transplanted into the body," adds Nguyen. "Ultimately, the goal of this project is to be able to redirect liver cells on a large scale."</p>



<p>Regenerative sciences is an emerging field aimed at delivering new medicines from biological sources such as blood and cells to address conditions with few therapeutic options. The goal is to cure disease rather than treat symptoms. Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;is leading efforts to develop groundbreaking curricula to train physicians and scientists for this potentially transformative medical care. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A disease with complications</strong></p>



<p>More than 100 million people in the U.S. have some form of liver disease, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://liverfoundation.org/about-your-liver/facts-about-liver-disease/how-many-people-have-liver-disease/#:~:text=More%20than%20100%20million%20people,been%20diagnosed%20with%20liver%20disease." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Liver Foundation</a>.&nbsp;While the liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate, chronic conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis and fatty liver disease can quickly progress to end-stage disease. Without a transplant, many patients will die.</p>



<p>Some people with cancer or alcohol use disorder are not suitable for transplantation. Those who are transplant candidates face complications including rejection, infection and risk of cancer.</p>



<p>"Stem cell-derived liver cells could provide a renewable source of liver cells to serve as a treatment for patients with liver failure. This could open the door to treatment for many liver patients who previously did not have any options," says Nguyen.</p>



<p>A native of Colorado, Nguyen was attracted to Mayo by the opportunity to train in clinical and laboratory settings with some of the most accomplished clinicians and researchers in the world.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic has so many exemplary physician-scientists. There is no shortage of mentors because faculty here are all so happy to share their expertise with you," she says. "I have been able to grow so much as both a budding clinician and scientist. I am thankful to continue my education here."</p>



<p>Nguyen aspires to specialize her practice and research in gastroenterology with a focus on hepatology (liver) transplantation. She is on a path to graduate with her M.D. and Ph.D. in 2027.</p>

<p>High-grade gliomas are cancerous tumors that spread quickly in the brain or spinal cord. In a new study led by Mayo Clinic, researchers found invasive brain tumor margins of high-grade <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioma</a> (HGG) contain biologically distinct genetic and molecular alterations that point to aggressive behavior and disease recurrence. The findings suggest insights into potential treatments that could modify the course of the disease.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41559-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;published in Nature Communications, profiled 313 tumor biopsies from 68 HGG patients using genomics (study of genes), transcriptomics (study of gene expression at the mRNA level) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>



<p>Glioma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord. The invasive margins of HGG have long remained a mystery due to the difficulties in surgical biopsy of these regions. The aggressive nature of most gliomas, and the visual and textural similarities between the affected regions and normal tissue, create a challenge for neurosurgeons during removal of the tumor. Some glioma cells may get left behind.</p>



<p>The cells in a glioma look like healthy brain cells called glial cells. As a glioma grows, it forms a mass of cells called a tumor. The tumor can grow to press on brain or spinal cord tissue, causing a range of symptoms. There are many types of glioma. Some grow slowly and aren't considered to be cancers. Others are considered cancerous. Malignant gliomas grow quickly and can invade healthy brain tissue.</p>
